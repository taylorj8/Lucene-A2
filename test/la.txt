headline:   ONLY IN L.A.   
text:   Most of Laurel Canyon Park off Mulholland Drive is now reserved for dogs, and  visiting humans have all the status of a fire hydrant.    While the Humane Society was holding a press conference there Thursday, a  canine crept up behind KABC (Channel 7) newsman Gene Gleeson, lifted up its leg  and sprayed him.    KNX radio reporter Diane Thompson, who was nearby, said she avoided the line of  fire because "I was keeping an eye on the dog."    Gleeson laughed off the incident, pointing out that the pooch missed most of  his leg. (Fortunately, TV reporters are generally seen from the waist up.)    And the impudent beast's owner? He or she never came forward.    How fierce is the competition in the real estate industry since the boom turned  into a bust? A publicist phoned to say that his client, a Beverly Hills real  estate agent, has taken to laminating his business cards so that he can pass  them out to bathers at the Beverly Hills Hotel swimming pool.    Sad.    Florida's lack of originality apparently knows no bounds.    The Sunshine State, as you know, has built imitations of Disneyland, the  Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Brown Derby and the Universal Studio Tour.  Recently, claiming to have discovered Medflies, it began a malathion-spraying  campaign.    Here's the topper: Federal prosecutors are now investigating the Miami Beach  mayor's dealings with a banker -- even before the end of the federal  investigation of our own Mayor Bradley's dealings with various financial  institutions.    No doubt Florida will soon have its own Malathion Poetry Contest, too. In the  meantime, Only in L.A.'s panel of distinguished judges gave this week's award  to Jeff Williamson of Sherman Oaks, who doused us with the following:    There must be citizens who feel     It's time to change the City Seal:     Let's add two Medflies to the rim     (The female making eyes at him!).     Williamson, who also submitted the seal, says the phrase at the bottom is "an  old heraldic way of saying, 'Enough already, no more spraying.' "    Great Inventions That Never Quite Caught On:    Fifty years ago, long before the advent of electronic turn signals for cars,  Westways magazine reported the development of a product called Arm-A-Lite.    It was a device that fit into the corner of the driver's window. The inventor's  idea, Westways said, was that when the driver made an arm signal to turn, his  arm would automatically hit a light switch. Then, a light would throw "a beam  on his arm, making it visible."    More evidence that the safe-sex campaign is gaining followers:    A woman's purse was stolen while she was paying for gasoline in Glassell Park.  The purse was found a week later on the roof of a neighboring McDonald's. The  only thing missing was a pack of condoms.      miscelLAny:    Remember the days when vandalism of bus benches amounted to an occasional  mustache added to a drawing? A city survey recently found that 75% of L.A.'s  6,700 benches had been defaced.

headline:   HE'S SEEN ERROR OF HIS WAYS;    ANGELS: FINLEY THROWS AWAY BUNT IN MARINERS' SEVEN-RUN FOURTH AND SEATTLE GOES  ON TO SCORE A 10-8 VICTORY.   
text:   Everything seemed in place for the Angels Thursday night. They had what they  always seem to be wanting -- a leadoff man and a lead.    They had Luis Polonia batting first, in his first start as an Angel. They  scored their first two runs on no hits, and led by four before the Mariners  batted a second time.    And on the mound they had Chuck Finley, the left-hander with a 0.96 earned-run  average.    The Angels seemed on their way to their third victory in a row. Instead, they  found themselves without one of the few things that seemed certain -- a steady  outing by Finley, who fell apart in the Angels' 10-8 loss to Seattle in front  of 12,279 in the Kingdome.    "I'll take full responsibility for the loss," said Finley, who fell to 3-2.  "The guys busted their . . . for me. They spotted me four runs. I'm not going  to sit and make excuses. I stunk. I feel bad."    Three more Angel errors -- raising their total to 19 -- played a large part in  the loss. One of them belonged to Finley, and it was the one that did him in.    He took a 6-3 lead into the Mariners' half of the fourth. But he left without  getting the first out of an inning that became a seven-run barrage, topped by  Jeff Leonard's second 400-foot homer of the game, a three-run shot off Scott  Bailes.    Finley walked the first two batters in the fourth, then gave up a run-scoring  single to Dave Valle. With runners on first and second, Mike Brumley bunted.  Finley fielded the ball within a few feet of the third-base line, but his throw  to first sailed past first baseman Wally Joyner. Darnell Coles and Valle raced  around the bases, Valle scoring ahead of Dante Bichette's throw.    That tied the score, 6-6, and Bailes relieved Finley, who eventually was  charged with seven runs, four of them earned.    Brumley, who had gone to second on Finley's error, was sacrificed to third by  Harold Reynolds, and scored when shortstop Donnie Hill was charged with an  error on Henry Cotto's grounder. Bailes walked Ken Griffey Jr., bringing up  Leonard.    "He kind of got me out of my game," said Bailes, saying that Leonard's first  home-run trot and his stalling had irritated him. "He stands a lot, too."    Leonard took a ball, and then sent a high fastball into the left-field stands,  a three-run homer that gave him two in a game for the seventh time in his  career, and tied his career-high of five RBIs.    "I go out and try to pitch like Nolan Ryan, and he does the same thing to me,"  Bailes said.    Bailes went four innings, giving up three runs, two of them earned, on three  hits. Together, he and Finley walked six batters, three each, and Seattle's six  pitchers walked seven.    Finley's shining earned-run average of 0.96 took on a decided tarnish, soaring  to 2.03. His record fell to 3-2.    He had not given up a home run all season, until Leonard's shot in the third  inning, which was estimated to have traveled 435 feet.    Unlike the team, Finley had not traveled overnight from Baltimore for the game  in Seattle, the first of six games the Angels must make up because of the  lockout. Instead, he traveled Wednesday afternoon in order to be rested.    Seattle starter Matt Young had the same option to travel from Boston, but chose  to come with the team.    The game began with the Mariners' starting pitcher struggling. The Angels  scored two runs on Young without getting a hit, putting together two walks and  two errors with a fielder's choice.    The Angels scored two again in the second, when Hill's double drove in Johnny  Ray, who had doubled, and Rick Schu, who singled.    The Mariners scored a run in the third when Darnell Coles doubled, driving in  O'Brien, who had singled.    Leonard's two-run homer in the third made it 4-3, but the Angels scored two  more runs in fourth on two walks and Devon White's two-run single.    Young left after three-plus innings, allowing six runs, four of them earned, on  four hits.    Rookie Brent Knackert, the second of six Seattle pitchers, earned his first  major league victory by giving up only one hit over two innings. Knackert, a  product of Ocean View High in Huntington Beach, made his first major league  appearance in front of his home fans at Anaheim Stadium last month.    The Angels mounted a rally in the eighth inning. Jack Howell, batting for Schu,  led off with a homer to right, his second. They added another run when Joyner's  two-out single to right drove in Polonia, who had singled and stole second.    Seattle ace Mike Schooler relieved, and Chili Davis' double to right put  runners on second and third. But Bichette lined out to left to end the inning  with the Angels still trailing, 10-8.    Schooler picked up the save, his sixth, by retiring the Angels in order in the  ninth.    Polonia's play in his role as the man who has relieved White of pressure to  lead off was the most encouraging aspect of the evening for the Angels, who  finished their longest road trip of the season with a 5-8 record.    Polonia started in left and went two for three. His repertoire included some  quality leadoff plays: He walked to open the game and later scored, he  sacrificed, and he stole a base.    "For the first time this year, I feel like I'm playing baseball," Polonia said.  "Before with the Yankees, I didn't. I can't wait (to play the Yankees). I've  got something for them. But I've got good control of myself."    "I thought he did a very good job," Manager Doug Rader said. "I'm happy for  Luis. He did a lot of things."    Angel Notes    The Seattle Fire Department was called to the Angels' hotel Thursday after an  alarm was pulled in a hallway when smoke was detected outside a player's room.  The player, whom neither the Angels nor the hotel would identify, had been  burning some papers in a trash can. Bert Blyleven, the usual suspect, was not  involved, an Angel spokesman said. "I heard the alarm and checked my room,"  said Blyleven, who has been known to set shoelaces on fire. "It wasn't me."    Johnny Ray's second-inning double was the 21st game in a row in which the  Angels have a double, equaling the team record. . . . Shortstop Dick Schofield  ran at about 50% Thursday, and continues to take ground balls and batting  practice. The Angels hope Schofield, recovering from a hamstring injury, will  be ready for his first appearance of the season in 10 to 14 days.

headline:   AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;    BLOWERS, YANKEES AT A LOSS   
text:   Mike Blowers of the New York Yankees might have been able to make sense of it  if the balls hit toward him Thursday were line drives, choppers or perfectly  executed drag bunts.    But Blowers, a rookie, tied an American League record for errors by a third  baseman when he failed to come up with four routine ground balls in the  Yankees' 10-5 loss to the Cleveland Indians in New York.    "It's not like I flubbed four hard-hit balls," Blowers said. "I'm still trying  to figure out what happened."    Blowers joined 20 other third basemen in the record book by committing two  errors in the seventh inning, one in the eighth and one in the ninth. The last  AL third baseman to commit four errors in a game was Floyd Rayford of the  Baltimore Orioles in 1986.    David Brain of the Boston Braves set the modern major league record for errors  by a third baseman when he committed five in 1906.    "I just couldn't find any kind of rhythm, couldn't get comfortable," Blowers  said. "I guess it's just one of those days, one of those things."    As a result of Blowers' errors, the Indians scored four unearned runs in the  seventh, one in the eighth and two in the ninth to hand the Yankees their fifth  consecutive loss.    Blowers was acquired by the Yankees in August from the Montreal Expos in a  trade for John Candelaria. He made four errors in 13 games with the Yankees  last season and had only two errors this season before Thursday's game.    "The kid just had a rough day," Yankee Manager Bucky Dent said. "I feel for  him. I'm not going to rip him. We all make errors. He just made a bunch all at  one time."    Sandy Alomar drove in five runs on three hits, including a tie-breaking,  two-run double in the eighth that gave the Indians a 7-5 lead.    Jesse Orosco (1-1), the Indians' fourth pitcher, got the victory, and Doug  Jones earned his eighth save.    Yankee reliever Jeff Robinson (0-1), who gave up two runs on three hits in the  seventh, took the loss.    Minnesota 3, Detroit 1 -- The Tigers led the major leagues with 103 losses last  season. They're on track to do the same this year.    Gary Gaetti's two-run homer in the 10th inning at Detroit extended the Tigers'  losing streak to five games and left them last in the East with an 8-15 record  -- the same mark they had last season after 23 games.    Mike Henneman (0-2) walked Kirby Puckett to lead off the 10th before Gaetti hit  his fourth home run. Gaetti, who had two three-run homers Wednesday night, hit  an 0-and-1 pitch from Henneman over the left-field wall.    Allan Anderson gave up one run on six hits in eight innings before he was  replaced by Terry Leach (2-0), who pitched a scoreless ninth for the victory.    Rick Aguilera pitched the 10th and earned his fifth save.    Milwaukee 9, Kansas City 5 -- Robin Yount's three-run, inside-the-park homer at  Kansas City paced the Brewers and dropped the Royals to 6-14, the worst record  in the major leagues.    Yount, who has half the 12 inside-the-park homers in Brewers history, chased  Mark Gubicza (1-4) with his homer in the fourth.    Jamie Navarro (1-0) went five innings to earn the win.    Dan Plesac earned his fourth save.

headline:   NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;    ARMSTRONG WINS FIFTH, REDS GET A 5-0 VICTORY OVER METS   
text:   Jack Armstrong joined some elite company Thursday night at New York with  another outstanding performance for the Cincinnati Reds.    Armstrong, a right-hander who was the Reds' No. 1 draft choice in 1987, pitched  7 2/3 innings and earned his fifth victory as the Reds beat the Mets, 5-0, for  their eighth victory in 10 road games.    Armstrong (5-0), Mets' left-hander Frank Viola and Oakland right-hander Dave  Stewart are the only five-game winners in the major leagues.    "I pitched pretty good I guess," said Armstrong, who allowed four hits, struck  out three and walked one. "I didn't overpower anyone."    He didn't have to against the error-prone Mets, who have lost five of their  last six and committed 27 errors in 22 games.    Howard Johnson made three errors, tying his club record for shortstops set on  July 18, 1985.    Joe Oliver keyed the Reds' offense with his first two home runs.    Former Met Randy Myers pitched 2 1/3 innings for his fifth save.    Houston 10, Philadelphia 3 -- Bill Gullickson pitched a strong game at  Philadelphia as the Astros beat the Phillies.    Gullickson (2-1), who was signed as a free agent last December after he went  21-14 in two seasons with the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, pitched 7 1/3 innings  and surrendered six hits to the Phillies, who had 20 hits Wednesday night in a  14-4 victory over the Astros.    Gullickson struck out four, walked three and never trailed after Ken Caminiti  hit a two-run single off Terry Mulholland (1-1) in the first inning.    Caminiti had three runs batted in.    Len Dykstra had four hits and Carmelo Martinez hit his third homer for the  Phillies.    Atlanta 4, Montreal 1 -- The Braves scored three runs in the ninth at Montreal  and extended their winning streak to five games.    Left-hander Tom Glavine pitched seven innings, giving up only a bunt single to  Otis Nixon.    Charlie Kerfeld (2-1) pitched a scoreless eighth to earn the victory. Joe  Boever pitched the ninth for his second save.    Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd had his best game since joining the Expos as a free agent  last winter, giving up six hits and striking out five in six innings.

headline:   DAUGHERTY SCORES 34 AS CAVALIERS EVEN SERIES WITH 76ERS;    NBA PLAYOFFS: CENTER IS ALMOST PERFECT IN 108-96 VICTORY. 76ERS WILL TRY TO WIN  SERIES AT HOME.   
text:   Anyone wondering why the Cleveland Cavaliers struggled early this season need  only glance at Brad Daugherty's line in Thursday night's box score.    Daugherty, who missed the first half of the season because of complications  after foot surgery, was nearly perfect. He went 12 of 15 from the floor, 10 of  12 from the free-throw line and scored a team playoff-record 34 points as the  Cavaliers beat the Philadelphia 76ers, 108-96, tying their Eastern Conference  quarterfinal series 2-2.    The deciding game will be Saturday in Philadelphia.    "We shot the ball poorly, and Brad Daugherty had a career night,"  Philadelphia's Charles Barkley said. "We've got to do something to shut him  down. We didn't double him tonight and he's too good not to double. We've got  to go back to the drawing board."    Cleveland was counting on a strong playoff series from Daugherty, who appears  to be hitting his stride after sitting out the first half.    "It felt like last year a little bit," Daugherty said. "The foot is really  coming around. I'm starting to get my strength back in it. But I think I'm at a  disadvantage, too, because I think I'm behind everybody else. I was in the  hospital two months."    Daugherty made 10 of his first 11 shots from the field. Mark Price set a  Cavalier playoff record with 18 assists. Daugherty also grabbed nine rebounds.    "He must have made four or five jump shots when we were helping pick up Price  on the drive," Philadelphia Coach Jim Lynam said. "Daugherty had a great game."    The two teams split their four regular-season games, each winning once at home  and once on the road. Each has won its two home games in the playoffs.    The Cavaliers shut down the 76ers in the fourth quarter, outscoring them,  22-14. The 76ers went scoreless from the field for seven minutes as Cleveland  widened an 89-84 lead early in the quarter to 97-85 with five minutes left.    Daugherty finished off the 8-1 flurry with a short hook shot and two free  throws.    As has been the case in all four playoff games, the Cavaliers got off to a  quick start, leading 34-23 after one quarter and 60-50 at halftime.    Cleveland let two halftime leads slip away in Philadelphia, but made the next  two stand up at home.    Barkley scored 23 points and had 11 rebounds. Hawkins scored 22, but only two  in the fourth quarter.

headline:   SUCCESS RELATIVE FOR DUO;    TENNIS: MOORPARK COLLEGE'S MOTHER-AND-DAUGHTER COMBINATION MAKES FOR A WINNING  SET.   
text:   Watching Moorpark College's No. 1 doubles team play is sort of like seeing  those old soap commercials -- look at their backhands and decide which player  is the mother and which is the daughter.    Their relationship isn't always apparent to opponents, but it quickly becomes  clear the first time Elise Nakawatase looks at Patti Nakawatase and says, "Nice  shot, Mom."    This unlikely pairing of college freshmen, a 45-year-old mother and her  18-year-old daughter, was as unexpected as it has been successful.    Patti, who never had competed in school-based athletics, already was planning  to take some classes at Moorpark when Elise asked her to join a tennis team  badly in need of players.    "I didn't really realize what I got into," Patti said.    Patti and Elise have been more than a novelty, winning seven of their 11  doubles matches. In singles, Patti is 8-1 at No. 6, and Elise is 9-6 at No. 1.    Their doubles team is among those receiving a first-round bye for the Western  State Conference tournament, which begins today and continues through Sunday at  Santa Barbara.    "It's been a little hectic and stressful, but I've enjoyed doing it," said  Patti, who didn't go on to college after graduating from Venice High in 1962.  "It's been fun to play with them. They're all so nice, but they hit so hard and  never get tired."    Patti and Elise had played together before, usually when Patti needed a  substitute for her social matches, but Elise played parent-child tournaments  with her father. As might be expected, mother and daughter have a certain  kinship on the court.    Elise's powerful strokes and speed complement Patti's doubles acumen. Playing  in three club leagues as well as frequent doubles matches with friends has left  Patti versed in the nuances of doubles play, recondite knowledge for college  players accustomed to singles.    "They play well together," Moorpark Coach Nancy Stewart said. "Patti knows the  court real well. Elise is very athletic."    Patti's specialties are poaches, lobs and off-speed shots, but Elise says her  mother hits the ball hard enough that "I know I don't have to worry about  getting the ball slammed in my face.    "What I like is my mom can hold her own most of the time," Elise said. "I know  they tend to pick on her more because she's the older one, but my mom pretty  much shows them."    Elise and Patti recently showed their moxie against WSC power Santa Barbara.  After falling behind, 4-1, Nakawatase and Nakawatase battled back to win the  first set, 7-6, and the match, 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (6-8), 6-0.    "I feel good on the court with her because she'll hold up her end and sometimes  mine," Patti said. "We get along better on the court than we do anywhere else.    "When we're on the court, we're partners, but anywhere else it's  mother-daughter."    The two are amicable on the court, with each other and their opponents. Their  relaxed demeanor and easy friendliness are a departure from the days when Elise  wouldn't let her mother watch her juniors matches because having Patti on the  sidelines made her too nervous.    "We've gotten closer now since we've been playing," Elise said. "We have more  to talk about now. Before we didn't get along as well."    This spring, Patti and Elise have metaphorically walked a mile in each other's  Nikes.    Elise now has to cook some meals for her father and younger brother because  Patti has night classes, and Patti better appreciates Elise's life as a  student.    "I think it's made us understand each other much better," Elise said.  "Personality-wise I'd say we're about the same. Attitude-wise and study  habit-wise we're different."    "She's more organized. Me, I take it as it comes."    The most difficult aspect of college athletics for Patti has been fitting all  the time demands into her schedule.    Patti juggles her 12-hour class load, which she needs to stay eligible for  athletics, with a 15-hour-a-week job at a Westlake Village accounting firm and  with keeping the family's Agoura Hills household humming.    In addition, she has standing commitments for several matches a week in leagues  and with friends.    Too busy to practice with the team, Patti said she nonetheless feels  comfortable on the squad.    "She's a lot of fun," said Amy Perry, a member of Moorpark's No. 2 doubles  team. On trips, "she always sits up front with the coach, and they usually talk  the whole time. The other girls sit and gossip, and they talk 'mom-stuff.' "    Cathleen Clark, another member of the No. 2 doubles team, admitted the players  sometimes "have to watch what we say; we kind of whisper sometimes," but added,  "She's just like one of the girls."    Yet Patti has a different perspective on college athletics than the rest of the  team.    Elise hopes to parlay her Moorpark experience into a spot on a four-year  college team, but for Patti, the experience has been an end unto itself.    Patti says she would have to quit her job to play next season, a sacrifice  she's not eager to make. She's still concentrating on completing this season,  which could last into mid-May.    If Elise and Patti win their first WSC tournament match, they'll be in the  final eight, which will automatically qualify them for the Southern California  regional of the state tournament.    If they do advance to regionals, which begin next Friday, they'll have to be  considered dark-horse contenders.    The last day of the regionals is, after all, Mother's Day.

headline:   UNDEFEATED SOUTH, WEST TORRANCE WANT CLEAR SKIES FOR SHOWDOWN;    PREP SOFTBALL: OCEAN LEAGUE RIVALS HAVE HAD THREE GAMES RAINED OUT THIS SEASON.  THEY WILL TRY AGAIN TODAY AND MONDAY.   
text:   With the Ocean League title on the line, how badly do the softball teams at  South Torrance and West Torrance high schools want to play each other?    Enough to stay out in the rain all day if they have to.    The rivals, tied for first place with 10-0 records, had their first scheduled  game rained out April 4. Two later games were also washed away.    They actually made it into the third inning Monday at South before umpires,  fearing injuries and heeding the calls of drenched parents and fans, called off  the scoreless game. Despite a heavy downpour and chilly winds, players from  both sides begged to have the game continue.    "It's not going to get any worse," pleaded one player whose spirit clearly  wasn't dampened. "Let's keep going."    "Come on, it's not raining that hard," said another.    Once the game was called off, complaints were heard on both sides, although the  fans let out grateful cheers before dashing for the parking lot.    "We don't care if it's raining or not. We just really want to play them," said  West freshman designated hitter Nicole Hendrix, who is hitting .319 and leads  the Warriors with two home runs. "We've been really up for them.    "Monday, it was raining really hard, but we were feeling good."    South junior shortstop Gillian Boxx said her team shares the excitement. She  said she was nervous for the first time in her career before Monday's game  because "they're such important games coming up. Everyone is waiting to see who  is going to be in first place."    The revised schedule has the two teams playing at West today and at South on  Monday in 3 p.m. games.    South and West played once early this season, in the Hawthorne Tournament.  South won, 4-0, behind the pitching of sophomore Jacqueline Brown (9-1), but  neither team attaches much significance to that meeting, since each was without  key players who were still playing basketball or soccer.    Brown will start Friday against Warrior senior Rosa Olloque (10-0), who has  tossed shutouts in seven of her last eight games. Spartan senior Julie DeJaifre  (2-1), who missed most of the season with a broken left foot, will start  against Olloque on Monday.    The return of DeJaifre, South's lone senior, could be crucial down the stretch,  second-year Coach Larry Lent said.    "I have a good one-two combination, and I always have a backup," said Lent,  whose team is 13-2 overall. "West High has an excellent pitcher in Rosa, but  they don't have a backup if something happens.    "If there is some trouble, I won't hesitate to make a change. (West) doesn't  have that luxury."    Indeed, the Spartans are confident coming into the crucial two-game series.  After outscoring league opponents, 99-3, they have a right to be. Also, South  has won two straight league crowns (Bay in 1988, Ocean in 1989) and features a  two-time league MVP in Boxx. Five Spartans are hitting .378 or better, led by  Boxx (.578, four home runs, 20 RBIs, 13 stole bases).    West Coach Jim Carrico, who has guided the Warriors to a 13-4 overall mark,  admits that South has a more dominant offense.    "We've been playing pressure ball all year," he said. "We don't blow anybody  away.    "We win 1-0, 2-0. We beat Morningside 4-0, and everybody else had beaten them  20-0."    But Carrico -- who lost his best hitter, senior first baseman Jennifer Mills  (.375), for the season with a broken right arm last month -- has three .300  hitters in his lineup and says his team makes good contact. "But we haven't had  the breaks," he said. "We've been hitting the ball right at people."    Carrico went on to say that South doesn't give West the respect it deserves.    "Our feeling is that they talk about how they're peaking and they're the team  to beat," he said. "But I think it's great (because) it's inspiring."    Some of his players have taken South's perceived cocky attitude more seriously.    "They want to beat us bad," said Hendrix, West's clean-up hitter. "And we want  to beat them bad.    "But they've been bringing bad things into it, and we just want a good, clean  game. They're saying that now that (DeJaifre) is back that they're going to get  us, and I don't think that's right. I guess she's supposed to be really hot  stuff.    "Personally, I didn't think she was that great. She is a good pitcher, but  nothing we haven't faced against Redondo or (Mira) Costa."    West shortstop Brigit Tapp, who is hitting .375 in the lead-off spot, added:  "We're getting more eager to play (South). They say they're peaking and ready,  but they haven't given us our respect. We're undefeated too. It'll just come  down to who gets the breaks."    Boxx, South's team leader for three years, said the Spartans also are getting  tired of all the talk leading up to the showdown. "It does make you want to  kind of just get it over with," she said.    Lent said it's understandable that tension is getting to players on both teams.  "We're just all up-tight," he explained.    Lent thinks both teams will fare well in the Southern Section 3-A playoffs that  start in less than two weeks. He also said that although Olloque is "hittable,"  she is an excellent pitcher, one of the best in Southern California.    For South, Boxx is especially important in critical games because of her  experience on national traveling teams. She has a calming effect on the whole  team, Lent said.    "She never feels pressure, or at least she never shows it," he said. "There are  times in critical situations where I'll turn to her and ask her what she  thinks.    "I can learn from her experiences and take some of the knowledge she has picked  up from other coaches."    Boxx said she accepts her role as a clutch player: "I know that a lot of times  I have to be the one to drive in runs."    She said she takes a simple approach to hitting. "I just try to keep the ball  out of the air," she said. "If I hit a grounder or a line drive, I feel like  I'm doing my job."    Helping Boxx produce runs for the Spartans are freshman third baseman Nicole  Odom (.418), junior catcher Deirdre Baker (.406), freshman designated hitter  Rachel Bosma (.400) and junior first baseman Monica Emmrich (.378, 14 stolen  bases).    Sophomore left fielder Beth Tapp (.340), joins sister Brigit and Hendrix as  West's offensive leaders. But, of course, big offensive production isn't the  Warriors' forte.    "Defense is our strength," Carrico said. "It's been keeping us in games all  year."    Olloque, who has a 0.22 ERA and averages less than two walks per game,  recognizes that strength, the coach said.    "Rosa throws strikes and makes them put it in play," Carrico said. "Don't get  me wrong; she has over 100 strikeouts. But she doesn't have to be a big  strikeout pitcher all the time."    Carrico calls Brigit Tapp "the backbone of the defense," but he said senior  catcher Mary Litzenberg is the true field general. "She's in charge out there,"  he said. "And Rosa and everyone else listen to what she says.    "After working with me for a couple of years, she knows how I think and what I  want."    All West and South want this afternoon are are sunny skies, a dry field,  respect and first place.

headline:   JC NOTES;    NEW COACH PUTS EL CAMINO IN THE SWIM FOR STATE MEET   
text:   Corey Stanbury, El Camino College's enthusiastic swimming and water polo coach,  has proven that with enough dedication, any program can be upgraded in a short  time.    In only his second season as head coach, Stanbury has made contenders out of  the once-ailing El Camino men's and women's swim teams.    In last week's South Coast Conference meet at Golden West College, the El  Camino men finished second and the women third. Seven Warriors -- two divers  and five swimmers -- qualified for the state meet, which started Thursday at  Mt. San Antonio College and ends Saturday.    Last season only one El Camino swimmer, Todd Douglas, and three divers  qualified for the state meet.    Douglas, an all-American last year, will compete in the 100- and 200-yard  breaststroke and the 400-yard medley relay. Sophomore Dan Wilkinson qualified  in the 500- and 1,650-yard freestyle, the 200 freestyle relay and the 400  medley.    Palos Verdes High freshman Scott Peppard will compete in both relays and the  50-yard freestyle. Freshman Bill Johnston will swim the last leg of the 200  freestyle relay.    The only woman swimmer to qualify is Nicole Standardi, a sophomore from Rolling  Hills High. Her outstanding performances in the 50-, 100- and 200-yard  freestyle have earned her spots in all three races at Mt. SAC this weekend.    "I think we're poised to do quite well," Stanbury said. I think both men and  women can finish in the top 10."    Stanbury is also confident in his two divers, freshmen Michelle Zimmer and Ed  Bangaster. Both have qualified on the one- and three-meter boards. Zimmer is  from North Torrance High, Bangaster from St. Bernard.    Though it won't be official until after next week's Southern California  Championships, it appears that El Camino is sending at least five athletes to  Santa Barbara for the state track meet May 18-19.    On the women's side, Sharette Garcia is a sure bet in the 800 and 1,500 meters  unless unexpected injuries hamper her. The petite sophomore from Belize is the  defending 800-meter state champion and the state runner-up at 1,500 meters. She  was also on El Camino's championship 4 x 400 relay team last year.    This season Garcia's marks in the 800 and 1,500 rank among the state's best. At  last weekend's SCC meet she swept the 1,500 in 4:49.56 and the 800 in 2:16.68.    Diana Tracy also had impressive performances at the conference meet in Walnut.  The 37 year-old won both the 3,000 and the 5,000 meters. Her 17:27.00 mark in  the 5,000 set a new league and school record. It's also a personal best for the  freshman from Hermosa Beach.    "We have a lot of quality athletes," said El Camino assistant coach Dean  Lofgren, "but unfortunately we don't have much depth."    That mostly applies to the field events, though Tiesha Holmes leads Southern  California in the long jump and triple jump. The freshman won both events at  Mt. SAC with marks of 18 feet, 8 1/2 inches in the long jump and 37 1/2 feet in  the triple jump.    The El Camino men also have a pair of leapers who should qualify for the  championships in Santa Barbara. Sophomores Ron Martin and Curtis Mitchell rank  among the state's best in their events. Last week Martin broke the SCC long  jump record with a leap of 25 feet, 1 inch.    Mitchell leads the state in the triple jump. He swept that event at the  conference finals with a mark of 52 feet, 5 1/2 inches. Coach Bill Moreno says  Mitchell is being highly recruited by top schools such as Louisiana State  University and UCLA.    SCC track coaches couldn't decide on a conference athlete of the year when they  met Wednesday, so they took the easy way out and picked four. Garcia, Tracy,  Jakki Henderson and Crystal Irbing were named co-athletes of the year in the  conference. Henderson is a sprinter at Mt. SAC, and Irbing is a sprinter at  Long Beach City College.    There's nothing new about Harbor College's baseball team making it to the  playoffs, this year's club is even more impressive than usual. The Seahawks,  41-5, have broken the school record for victories in a season.    Granted, Harbor is in a weak league, but the Seahawks also have solid  tournament victories over top-notch teams such as defending state champion  Cerritos.    Remarkably, the Harbor players have managed to get pumped up for all 19 games  they have played in the six-member Southern California Athletic Conference,  despite the lack of competition. They finished league play 19-0.    How much of a cakewalk has it been? Only one regular starter -- center fielder  Mike Murphy -- played in Harbor's last conference game, against Barstow on  April 26, and the Seahawks still won, 13-3. Coach Jim O'Brien, sure there was  nothing to worry about, was at a coaches' meeting in San Francisco while his  reserves nailed Barstow.    The playoffs should provide more excitement for the confident Seahawks.  Post-season action starts May 11 against a team yet to be determined.    At the state championship tournament, scheduled May 25-27 at UC Irvine, Harbor  looks as if it's equipped to improve on last year's third-place finish.

headline:   COLLEGE NOTES;    BENEFITS OF THE BIG TIME: LOYOLA TO PLAY IN MAUI   
text:   Loyola Marymount basketball hit the big time in the recent NCAA Tournament and  is starting to reap some of the benefits, as evidenced by the Lions' invitation  to a prestigious season-opening tournament next fall.    The Lions will play in the eight-team Chaminade Maui Classic in Hawaii. And in  a field that includes national powers Syracuse and Indiana, Loyola is being  played up as one of the marquee names.    "Loyola Marymount has been the Cinderella team this year, and I consider it a  feather in our cap to have such an exciting team opening their season with us,"  said Chaminade Athletic Director Mike Vasconcellos.    The Maui Classic, held in the Lahaina Civic Center, annually brings together a  national field for the season-opening weekend. Missouri beat Oklahoma in last  year's championship game, and eventual NCAA champ Michigan beat defending champ  Kansas the year before. This year's games will be played Nov. 23-24-25,  starting the day after Thanksgiving.    The field also includes Iowa State, Northeastern, host Chaminade and Loyola  conference foe Santa Clara. Arkansas-Little Rock pulled out after Coach Mike  Newell left and has been replaced by the University of Toledo.    A television package is being worked out, and Vasconcellos said opening  matchups should be set within a month -- with television having some input. (He  said Loyola and Santa Clara won't be put in the same bracket.) TV has found the  fast-breaking Lions to its liking the last two years, when Loyola set national  scoring records in both seasons.    Vasconcellos said another factor favored Loyola's selection. "We always have to  have a Catholic school in the field," he said. "Us Catholic schools have to  stick together."    In fact, Chaminade, a Catholic institution with an enrollment similar to  Loyola's, is planning to upgrade its program to Division I and has made  inquiries to the West Coast Conference about joining sometime in the 1990s.    In playing host to the tournament, Chaminade has even pulled off some major  upsets. "It's more of a spectacle than a tournament," Vasconcellos said.  "There's golf, a luau. We provide the sun, the surf, and try to sneak up on  somebody.    "Winning and losing is almost incidental. It's really a cultural event. The  players love it. It's a great way to start the season. It's like spring  training -- the kids are fresh; they get to interact with the other teams. When  (Coach) Rollie Massimino came out with Villanova, he set an all-time golf  record for a basketball coach. And let's face it, if you're gonna lose, you  might was well lose in Hawaii. It beats losing in North Dakota."    Close Shave: It's been a banner year for Loyola Marymount women's tennis. In  fact, one might say the Lions have been razor sharp.    For 16 years, tennis Coach Jamie Sanchez has been telling his teams that if  they could finish as high as third in the West Coast Conference, he would shave  his beard and mustache. (He doesn't worry about finishing first because  perennial winners Pepperdine and San Diego grant tennis scholarships. The other  teams in the conference don't.)    Well, the Lions finally placed third in the conference tournament two weeks  ago, and Sanchez began getting calls from former players and alumni. "So I went  ahead and (shaved)," Sanchez said, laughing. "Now everybody tells me I look  younger, so it might be a benefit."    The Lions' top gun was junior Lynn Stogner, who recently won the No. 1 singles  title in the independent division at the Ojai Tournament. She lived up to her  top seeding, winning all four matches and defeating UC San Diego's Kristine  Bahrens in the final, 6-3, 7-6. Stogner was the Lions' top player despite a  season-long wrist injury that was scheduled for surgery today.    Sanchez's Lions also won the doubles title at Ojai behind freshman Kim Florez  and senior Jori Stinar, giving Loyola the team title in the Intercollegiate  Independent category.    The Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball team continues to struggle in the  California Collegiate Athletic Conference, but third baseman Fred Camarena  still has a chance to break the team batting record.    The Toros, 17-21-2 overall, lost to UC Riverside, 5-0, earlier this week and  take a 8-16 CCAA record into today's 3 p.m. home game against Cal Poly Pomona.    Camarena, however, hit in his 11th straight game against Riverside to raise his  season average to .404. With eight games to play, Camarena is hoping to become  the second Toro to hit .400, and is shooting for Ruben Jauregui's 1988 record  of .406.    Since dropping to his season low of .365 on April 7, the senior from Brea has  steadily raised his average to its current mark. In his 11-game streak Camarena  has hit .500 (19 for 38).    Stat of the Week: When the Loyola Marymount baseball team was beaten by Long  Beach State, 5-0, on Tuesday, it was the first time the Lions had been blanked  this season and the first time in 107 games. The last team to shut out the  Lions was Long Beach State in February, 1989.

headline:   NAIA DISTRICT 3 SOFTBALL TOURNAMENT;    CAL LUTHERAN ARMED WITH STRONG PITCHING   
text:   Cal Lutheran will rely on the one-two pitching punch of Dee Andra Pilkington  and Leslie Stevens in seeking its third consecutive appearance in the National  Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics softball finals.    Pilkington (15-6, 1.04 earned-run average), a senior right-hander, and Stevens  (12-4, 1.46 ERA), a junior right-hander, give Cal Lutheran an unusually deep  and well-balanced staff.    "That's one of the advantages we'll have going into this district (playoff) is  that both pitchers' arms are not tired," Cal Lutheran Coach Tony Venditto said.  "We can play back to back (or) we can play two or three games in one day and  not hurt us."    The Regals (29-10-2, 14-2 in district play) are making their sixth consecutive  appearance in the District 3 championships, which begin today at Cal Lutheran.    Pilkington, an All-American last season, will open the first game of the  two-team, best-of-three series against Cal Baptist (23-22, 9-8) at 11 a.m.  Stevens, who has won her past nine decisions, will pitch the second game, which  will start 30 minutes after the completion of the first. Pilkington will return  for a third game, if necessary, at 11 a.m. Saturday.    Stevens was named District 3 Player of the Week after going nine for 25 in six  games last week. She is batting .328 this season. Pilkington, earlier named  District Pitcher of the Week, and Stevens are the only two Cal Lutheran players  to receive either district honor this season.    The District 3 champion will travel to play the winner of District 7, probably  either Western New Mexico State or Mesa State (Colo.), in a best-of-three  bi-district tournament, May 10-11. The winner moves on to the 16-team  nationals, May 17-19 at the University of West Florida in Pensacola.    Cal Lutheran's past two trips to the nationals, a double-elimination  tournament, ended quickly with consecutive losses both years, but first-year  coach Venditto believes that past is not necessarily prologue for his  14th-ranked Regals.    "We have really what I call a three-step goal to win districts, to win  bi-districts and go to nationals," said Venditto. "I honestly believe we can  finish in the top four of nationals."    Cal Lutheran has won all four meetings with Cal Baptist.    Kim White leads the team in 10 offensive categories, including batting average  (.391). After playing center field and second base, White has moved to third  base to replace Tina Bumgarner, the team leader in runs batted in (25) who  suffered a season-ending knee injury.

headline:   ROUNDUP;    HIGHLAND HALL CLINCHES 4TH TITLE IN A ROW   
text:   Highland Hall High routed host South Bay Lutheran, 28-3, Thursday to clinch its  fourth consecutive Westside League title with its 31st league victory in a row.    Jakob Jensen (8-0) pitched three innings to earn the win and hit a grand slam  and drove in seven runs.    Five players had three hits for Highland Hall (20-2, 7-0 in league play).    In other baseball games:    Sylmar 8, Grant 3 -- London Woodfin knocked out three hits and drove in two  runs to lead host Sylmar to an East Valley League win in a makeup of a rainout.    Gonzalo Hernandez (5-3) pitched 3 1/3 innings of middle relief to pick up the  win for second-place Sylmar (16-7, 10-5). James Encinas added two hits and two  runs batted in for the winners.    Tony Kuper (3-7) took the loss for Grant (5-17, 3-12).    Queen of Angels 5, Oakwood 4 -- Tony Garcia's two-out, two-run double in the  seventh inning erased a 4-3 deficit and gave Queen of Angels (11-4, 11-0) the  Liberty League championship. Felix Renteria had two hits, including a triple,  to lead Queen of Angels.    Darin Margules, Gentry Dick and Matt Williams each had two hits for Oakwood  (11-3, 8-2).    SOFTBALL    Hart 1, San Gabriel 0 (eight innings) -- Kym Weil (21-1) notched her 82nd  career win, breaking the Southern Section record held by De De Weinman of Gahr  in leading Hart (22-2, 8-0) to an extra-inning Foothill League win at San  Gabriel.    Heather Medearis hit a home run down the right-field line to open the eighth  inning in support of Weil, who struck out 10 and walked none in scattering five  hits.    Simi Valley 1, Camarillo 0 -- Heather Santiago allowed only one hit and Taina  Tande scored on a sixth-inning error as Simi Valley (18-8, 8-3) secured second  place in the Marmonte League.    Santiago struck out 12 and lost her no-hit bid when Kim Mangan singled in the  fifth.    Faith Baptist 11, Brentwood 0 -- April Will hit two home runs and drove in  three runs to lead host Faith Baptist (5-9, 5-2) to a Delphic League win.    Alemany 3, Chaminade 1 -- Brenda Garcia and winning pitcher Melanie Howard  (10-3) stroked RBI doubles in a three-run third inning for Alemany (16-5, 6-2)  in a San Fernando Valley League game at Chaminade.    Saugus 1, Palmdale 0 -- Saugus (14-10, 6-2) broke a first-place tie in the  Golden League with Palmdale (18-6, 5-3) on the strength of a one-hitter by  sophomore Kerry Coudry.    Newbury Park 7, Westlake 1 -- Melody Bolger had three hits and Marcie James  drove in two runs to support the two-hit pitching of Lea Lopez (16-5) for host  Newbury Park (20-6, 11-1) in a Marmonte League game.    Hoover 8, Pasadena 0 -- Nancy Evans (15-4) struck out 16, walked none and  scattered two hits for Hoover (16-4, 5-3) in a Pacific League game at Pasadena.    La Reina 14, Carpinteria 0 -- Valerie Serpico was three for three, including a  three-run triple, and Michelle St. Pierre (9-3) tossed a two-hitter to lead La  Reina (18-5, 10-0), which clinched the Tri-Valley League title.    San Fernando 12, Kennedy 3 -- Gloria Sanchez and Gina Mena each had two hits  and a triple for San Fernando (13-6, 6-4) in a North Valley League game at  Kennedy.    Cleveland 14, Granada Hills 6 -- Amy Horst had two hits, including a home run,  to spark Cleveland in a North Valley League game at Granada Hills.    Poly 10, North Hollywood 6 -- Tina Thomas' bases-loaded triple and Jodi Soto's  three-run home run keyed a six-run second inning for Poly (12-5, 5-1), which  clinched its third consecutive East Valley League title.    El Camino Real 6, Taft 0 -- Chrissy Peck tossed a one-hitter and struck out  nine to round out an unbeaten Northwest Valley Conference season for host El  Camino Real (18-2, 10-0).

headline:   NOTEBOOK;    GORDON, LIEBERTHAL TO SQUARE OFF IN BID TO SETTLE POWER STRUGGLE   
text:   Joe Gordon of Simi Valley High and Westlake's Mike Lieberthal will go head to  head today in their quests for the Southern Section single-season home run  record when Westlake visits Simi Valley in a Marmonte League game.    Gordon hit his 14th homer Wednesday, leaving him two shy of the record set by  Arnold Garcia of Channel Islands in 1981. Lieberthal has been stuck at 13 since  April 20.    Garcia was a left-handed pull hitter whose home runs over the right-field fence  at Channel Islands would be met by a chorus of moos.    "There was an animal-husbandry class on the other side of the fence," recalled  Don Cardinal, the Channel Islands coach. "We'd say he was taking them deep into  the cows."    Because Channel Islands is also in the Marmonte League, Cardinal has watched  firsthand the assault on Garcia's record.    "Arnold was a lot like Gordon and Lieberthal," he said. "Not a big kid, but he  just had that stroke, and he worked real hard at his hitting."    Although Gordon has hit more home runs recently, Lieberthal figures to have  more games ahead of him.    Simi Valley (11-11, 4-6 in league play) finishes its league schedule Wednesday  and is a long shot to make the playoffs. Westlake (23-1, 11-0) closes out  league play today but is certain to be the top-seeded team in the 5-A Division  playoffs.    Pitching rich: Few expected Saugus High to have strong pitching this season.    Gone was Roger Salkeld, picked third in last June's amateur draft by the  Seattle Mariners.    Left behind were sophomores Chris Hernandez and David Weeg, and junior Doug  Maggiora, who logged all of six innings last season.    But a combined effort has carried the Centurions far. With a respectable team  earned-run average of 3.49, Saugus (15-5-1 overall) is atop the Golden League  standings with a 10-1 record and holds a three-game lead over second-place  Palmdale.    The side-arming Maggiora, who routinely has entered games in the middle  innings, has been most impressive. He has compiled an 8-1 record with four  saves and a 2.59 ERA in 67 1/3 innings -- most in the Valley area.    Hernandez (5-2, 4.20), a left-hander, and Weeg (2-0, 3.29), a right-hander,  have held their own at the varsity level and show a lot of promise.    In the spotlight: New names have cropped up in the box scores of Poly's games.  A look at the batteries in recent Parrot outings reveals names such as Torres  and Rocha notching wins and saves for Poly (20-3, 15-0) -- names unseen two  weeks ago.    But the fresh faces are producing. Raul Torres and Adolpho Rocha, both juniors,  have been thrust into the limelight since mainstays David Giatti (broken ankle)  and Rodrigo Dorame (tender arm) became unable to pitch.    Torres, especially, has been effective, notching a 4-1 record in six  appearances. He is now Coach Jerry Cord's No. 2 starter behind senior Eddie  Castellanos (11-0).    "They're still just getting their feet wet, really," Cord said of the tandem.  "I didn't figure they'd throw much, except in relief. But they're just tough  kids. They want to compete."    If it isn't broken: Birmingham has won 12 consecutive games. Birmingham is a  baseball team. Ergo, Birmingham is superstitious.    Following the grand baseball tradition of quirky, off-beat behavior that  characterizes a team on a win streak, the Braves have decided to shun their  white, home jerseys in favor of the blue road jerseys they wore during the  Holt-Goodman tournament that launched the win streak. Even at home, the Braves  wear road blue.    "It came time for us to wear our home jerseys again," Coach Wayne Sink said,  "and the guys said to me, 'White jerseys? What white jerseys?' "    Staff writers Steve Henson, Vince Kowalick and Brian Murphy contributed to this  notebook.

The No. 12-ranked Aztecs (17-11) were seeded 14th and will play 17th-seeded  Indiana Wednesday. No. 14-ranked USD (11-11) was seeded 16th and will play  19th-seeded Kentucky.    La Jolla's Liz Harper is the only San Diegan to advance to today's  quarterfinals of the National Hardcourt championships at the La Jolla Beach and  Tennis Club. Harper, seeded sixth and playing in the women's 60s, defeated Fay  Shwayder of Lakewood, Colo., 6-0, 6-1 to advance.    MEN'S TENNIS    In the Western Athletic Conference team championships in Fort Collins, Colo.,  the top-seeded SDSU men's team was upset by Utah, 5-1. It is the ninth time in  11 years defending champion Utah has won the WAC team title.    After winning the singles competition, 5-1, the teams did not play doubles.  Freshman Kerry Safdie was the only winner for the Aztecs, defeating Chris  Reilley 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5). SDSU (21-9) finished second and Mew Mexico and Air  Force tied for third.    MEN'S GOLF    San Diego State golfers Kevin Riley and Doug Karney recorded scores of 69 and  were tied with two other golfers for second place after the opening round of  the Western Athletic Conference tournament, Thursday.    Riley and Karney trailed Brigham Young's Ed Fryatt and Mike Weir, who both shot  tournament-record 65s in the first of four rounds in El Paso, Texas. BYU, at  10-under-par 270, led the team standings. SDSU was fourth at 10-over 290.    Second-seeded Kim Wright was one of three Point Loma Nazarene singles players  who advanced to the round of eight in the NAIA District 3 Women's Tennis  Championships Thursday.

headline:   WARD'S FONDEST MEMORIES FUELED BY INDY   
text:   As one of the most successful race drivers of all time, Rodger Ward has enough  memories to fill several books.    Tops on Ward's list, of course, is his remarkable record in the Indianapolis  500. He won it twice and from 1959 through 1964 finished first, second, third,  first, fourth and second.    During that period, Ward won two USAC season championships, was runner-up three  times and placed third once. All told, he won 26 championship races between  1951 and his retirement in 1966.    Ward will always look back fondly to the place where it all began -- the old  quarter-mile dirt track at Balboa Stadium.    Now 69, Ward reminisced while speaking at the Hall of Champions recently. He is  in town from his home in Alta Loma for the second Rodger Ward Invitational  Historic Grand Prix, which will be held Saturday and Sunday on a 1.7-mile road  course in the west parking lot at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.    "Balboa is where I really blossomed as a race driver," Ward said. "It's one of  my all-time favorite tracks."    Ward was born in Beloit, Kan., but grew up in South Pasadena, where he built a  hot rod from used parts in his father's wrecking yard at the age of 13. He was  fresh from a four-year hitch as an Air Force pilot in World War II when he made  his debut as a midget-car driver at Balboa in 1946. He scored his first victory  a year later in the San Diego Grand Prix.    "The first race I ever drove, I wound up upside down," he said. "I was running  last and, when I made my move, I spun out. Then Johnny Mantz's car hit my car,  and they took me to the hospital to see if my brains were scrambled.    "In '47, I had a car that ran pretty well but I wasn't making it into the main  event. Toward the end of '47, I got into a car owned by Willie West and, for  the first time, I was the fastest qualifier. I won a trophy dash or two, and I  was always in the main event.    "Then came the San Diego Grand Prix. I qualified second, so I was on the  outside of the front row. I took the lead on the first turn and was never  headed. Those few weeks in that car were the beginning of my success."    From then through 1950, Ward won "about six or seven races a year" at Balboa  Stadium.    "I'm not sure how many I won altogether, but it was around 25," Ward said.  "That was all in midgets."    Ward also had some trying times at Balboa Stadium.    "In '49, I was driving for Perry Grim and there was one evening I'll never  forget," Ward said. "Perry said to me, 'Rodger, I know you like to run high,  but there's one hole on the track, so make sure you miss it.'    "Well, I went out to qualify and, the first time around, I hit the hole and  flipped upside down. The car was bent all to hell, and Perry was fit to be  tied.    "Later that year, Jimmy Bryan, who went on to be a tough Indy driver (winning  the 500 in 1958), tried to do a slide job on me. He didn't get by, and he  knocked me upside down.    "It was one of the worst accidents I ever had. I broke my right arm and left  wrist, and the ball of my right shoulder was cut into five pieces. I was out  until late in the season."    Ward's most serious crackup occurred at the Riverside Speedway in 1962.    "I broke my back in three places that time," he said. "My brakes failed and I  went off an embankment. My only thought was to keep the car right-side up. If I  had flipped over, it would have wiped me out. I went through a chain-link fence  that I thought was going to break my head off, but I stayed up."    There is one accident that still brings sadness to Ward. He was a key figure in  the wreck that took the life of Bill Vukovich in the 1955 Indy 500.    "Billy and I were close friends," Ward said. "We traveled together, and I  really admired him. He had won Indy in '53 and '54 and would have won in '52 if  his steering hadn't failed with nine laps to go.    "He was leading again after 56 laps and I was three laps behind him when my  front axle broke. I hit the wall and flipped three times and ended up on the  track. Al Keller went across the track to avoid me and hit Johnny Boyd. Then  Vukovich ran up over Boyd, flipped end over end, and lost his life.    "Because of that tragedy, I nearly retired. I was so distressed, I was ready to  hang it up then and there. But Billy's brother told me I could be great if I  concentrated on driving, so I made up my mind to become more serious about it."    Foremost in Ward's determination to dig deeper within himself was to shed his  reputation as a playboy.    "Until then, I was probably more famous for my social life," he said. "People  thought I drank too much, although actually I drank very little, but I was  never able to handle booze. I also chased a few women at that time.    "The car I drove in '55 was owned by Lyle Greenman, who had bought it from J.C.  Agajanian after Troy Ruttman won the 500 with it in '52. Before the race,  Greenman said to me, 'I don't know if you can last 500 miles, because you're up  all night.' I'll have to admit I hadn't done much to dispel that reputation.    "So after Billy Vukovich's death, I gave up smoking and drinking, and I decided  it was in my best interests to get married. In those days, if you were a single  man on the road, people considered you a bum."    Ward's change in life style -- he was married in the early 1950s, later  divorced and remarried 10 years ago -- paid off. He finished eighth in 1956,  and after being forced out the next two years by mechanical problems, he found  the combination that carried him to his first victory in 1959.    Ward had been driving for Roger Wolcott, who died after the 1958 season.  Suddenly a free agent, Ward decided to hook up with a Milwaukee car owner named  Bob Wilke. A.J. Watson was Wilke's chief mechanic, and Ward considered Watson  the best.    "Wilke gave me $1,000 to sign and $1,500 when I qualified for Indy. I was a kid  with a new toy.    "They built me a new car every year, and I was always up there. Besides the two  500s I won, I should have won two others -- in '60 and '64. Those years, things  that shouldn't have happened went wrong."    After failing to qualify in 1965 and placing 15th in 1966, Ward decided to  retire.    "Watson built me a car in '65 that was a total disaster," Ward said. "I thought  about retiring then, but I didn't want to go out on a sour note, so I kept  racing in '66. I won at Trenton, finished second at Phoenix and qualified quite  well at Indy, so I felt like I had proved to myself that I could still drive.    "I made my retirement announcement at the awards dinner after the 500, and it  was a very emotional thing. I had offers to drive again, but I couldn't have  lived with myself if I'd come back and been an also-ran."    Ward now serves as an analyst on many auto-race telecasts, and is much in  demand for speaking engagements. Although he dropped out of Franklin High  School in Highland Park after his junior year, it would be hard to find a more  articulate or entertaining speaker.    "I was always a glib talker," he said. "And wherever I go, I recall the old  days at Balboa Stadium. It was one of the places I really enjoyed racing. The  crowds were probably more enthusiastic than anywhere else."    Race Notes    Rodger Ward rode in last year's inaugural Vintage Grand Prix as a passenger in  a 1914 Tahi Special, in which it was necessary for him to pump the oil and gas.  He says he might drive this year but won't say for sure. . . . Racing starts at  1 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday, following trials from 9 a.m. to noon. There  will be seven races each day with cars in nine different classifications. One  race will consist of 14 restored pre-World War II race cars; five others will  match foreign and domestic production cars matched according to size and horse  power. Two formula races will include class A, B and C model cars, including  McLarens, Lotuses, Lolas, Coopers and Porsches. . . . All races will be run on  a nine-turn, 1.7-mile-course on the west end of the San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium parking lot. A total of 160 cars have been entered, all built before  1972. . . . An car auction will be held from noon to 6 p.m. both days near the  main gate. . . . Tickets are $12 a day, $22 for both days purchased in advance,  $15 and $25 if purchased at the gate. Parking is free.

headline:   LA JOLLA WOMAN HOPING FOR HOME-COURT EDGE   
text:   With the home-court advantage and a history of success against higher seeded  players, Liz Harper of La Jolla might well be in position to win the women's  60s singles in the U.S. National Hardcourt Championships at the La Jolla Beach  and Tennis Club.    Harper, who plays No. 1-seeded Margorie Kohler of Carmel in today's  quarterfinals, is trying to win her third tournament in as many tries this  season. She defeated Fay Schwayder, of Lakewood, Colo., 6-0, 6-1, in the third  round Thursday.    After receiving a first-round bye, Harper, the sixth seed, defeated Muriel Bard  of Laguna Hills, 6-0, 6-2, in Wednesday's second round.    "I've played all the top seeds before and on occasion beaten them," Harper  said. "To win a national tournament, it takes a combination of playing well and  some luck, too."    Just last week, Harper defeated Kohler of Carmel at the Northern California  Sectionals in Carmel.    "I think she was a little nervous since it was her home court," Harper said.  "I'm sure she wants to meet me again."    In February, Harper won the Southern California Tournament at Palm Springs, her  first appearance this year.    Harper shies away from playing both singles and doubles in national tournaments  because the competition is tougher and the matches are usually longer.    "The competition is so tough when I get to the later rounds," Harper said. "I  just have too much tennis to play. I like singles better so I usually just play  singles."    Harper grew up in Santa Maria, which at that time had a population of 10,000  and no tennis programs.    While attending UC Berkeley she met her future husband Oscar Harper, who was a  member of the men's tennis team. Once they began dating, she figured she better  learn how to play. She took lessons but didn't compete in her first tournament  until she was 40 and living in Altadena.    She taught at Mayfield Senior School, a private girls' school, and served as  the tennis coach, health education teacher and athletic director.    "Since tennis was a part of my work, I was giving more hours to work on my  game," Harper said. "In trying to help and analyze other people, my stamina  improved. I hit that many more tennis balls."    Now, because both Liz and Oscar have retired, they are able to practice  together and they occasionally play in tournaments with senior mixed doubles.  This one doesn't.    "It's much better on the mixed doubles court if we don't talk," Harper said.  "Some couples argue while they're playing, but we get along on the court. Oscar  calls it mixed troubles, but always with a smile."    The Harpers will have an unusual experience this summer when they travel to  Europe for the first time to play in two tournaments, one in Vichy, France, and  the other in Monaco. They will play singles and mixed doubles.    Not only must they adapt to playing on clay instead of hardcourt, the language  barrier could present a problem when it comes to scoring. Consequently, Harper  carries a French pocket dictionary in order to practice scoring and key  phrases. Harper has played on both clay and grass but prefers hardcourt or  indoor surfaces.    "I'll probably lose my concentration on my game," she said, laughing, "because  I'll be trying to figure out how to say the score."

headline:   USIU KEEPS TALKING UP AN AMERICAN CONFERENCE   
text:   Come the 1991-92 basketball season, U.S. International may take its  high-scoring act and soar happily above what it hopes will be the newest NCAA  affiliate: the American Conference.    Thursday in Mission Valley, athletic directors from six independent  universities gathered to further discuss plans for a new conference that Al  Palmiotto, USIU Athletic Director, has been working on for two years.    After a day of discussion, representatives from USIU, Southern Utah State, Cal  State Northridge, Missouri-Kansas City, Northeastern Illinois and Chicago State  agreed to take recommendations for a new basketball conference back to their  respective presidents for approval by June 7.    In addition to the six schools attending -- the NCAA requirement to form a  conference -- Sacramento State, Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Youngstown and Wright  State expressed interest but failed to send a representative.    "We agreed that a basketball conference would be in our best interest," said  Palmiotto, "and right now, it would be a beginning for all of us. We decided  we're all going back to our schools to get approval or denial."    Palmiotto and the other athletic directors decided that forming a  basketball-only conference would be beneficial because basketball is the only  sport where they consistently have scheduling difficulties.    "The trouble with being an independent," said Palmiotto, "is that we never know  until that year if people will hold to their contract with us. There's more of  a moral commitment in a conference. People in our conference won't walk out."    Bob Heigert, Cal State Northridge athletic director, said scheduling basketball  games for November and December is easy, but January and February is another  story.    "We have five established conferences on the West Coast," Heigert said. "That  puts us in a bind when we have to schedule games. It leaves us with some  tremendous voids. We're off the last three weeks in December to late January  and we can never find teams to play us."    Palmiotto said schools will be required to make a two-year commitment to the  conference.

headline:   MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: EXPORTS FUELING THE ECONOMY, MAY SPARK STOCK RALLY   
text:   An old story on Wall Street may soon get new attention -- and for good reason.  It may justify the stock market's next surge.    The story is that overseas demand for U.S. goods and services continues to  mushroom. Export business is so good, in fact, that it helped make up for soft  domestic demand in the first quarter for many companies. That kept the slide in  first-quarter corporate profits from being a lot worse than it might have been.    "Export certainly has been one of the reasons why the manufacturing economy  hasn't sunk any lower," said Robert Bretz, who heads the business survey  committee of the National Assn. of Purchasing Management.    His group, which tracks the economy by watching supply and demand trends at  major companies, said its export index in April was the highest since  September.    The continuing export boom may be under-appreciated by a jaded Wall Street.  Consider that domestic demand for manufactured goods has been sluggish for  about a year as car, housing and appliance sales have weakened. That has been a  general drag on the economy.    Meanwhile, exports of heavy equipment and high-tech products to Europe and Asia  keep growing, reaching levels that many U.S. companies could only have dreamed  about in the early 1980s.    Add it up, and the export strength is a partial answer to the mystery of the  economy's resilience in the face of weak domestic demand.    "This is just what the doctor ordered," notes David Hale, economist at Kemper  Financial Services in Chicago. Remember when, just a few years back, economists  warned that flat exports and rising imports threatened to cut the legs out from  under the U.S. economy?    In 1987, this country imported $113 billion more than it exported, counting all  goods and services. By last year, the deficit was cut to $47 billion.    So the progress is real. And even better, it's almost certain to continue, even  as the dollar remains surprisingly strong -- normally a negative for exporters.  The simple fact is that the world needs a lot of new nuts-and-bolts-type  equipment.    "One of the bullish things about the next two to three years is the capital  goods cycle," Hale said. Overseas and at home, many companies are spending huge  amounts of money to modernize their plants or build new ones. Governments,  meanwhile, are committed to rebuilding sewer and road systems and to forcing  new pollution-control systems on factories. And Eastern Europe will require a  major overhaul if it's to be brought into the world trading system.    The machinery needed for those projects -- the air compressors, generators,  tractors, computers and other goods -- are the forte of U.S. manufacturers.  Even if West Germany wanted to keep the entire European market to itself, it  couldn't, notes Lacy Hunt, economist at CM&amp;M Group in New York. "West  German plants already are working at capacity," he said. And Japan, too, is  investing heavily in its own economy, limiting its export capacity.    Hunt believes that another surge in U.S. exports, combined with new vigor in  the service economy, will push real U.S. economic growth to an annualized rate  of 3% in the current quarter, from 2.1% in the first quarter.    Translation for the stock market: Corporate profits may come in much stronger  than expected. And even if interest rates continue to inch higher -- the price  we pay for an expanding economy -- the end of recession worries may give  investors new reasons to look at stocks.    Although investors are conditioned to believe that stocks can't rise if  interest rates are rising, it isn't true. Everything depends on the economic  background. Stocks soared in 1983 as the economy rebounded, even though rates  were rising as well.    In recent days, stocks such as Deere, Caterpillar, Ingersoll-Rand, Fluor Corp.  and Compaq Computer have seen renewed buying. All are major exporters of goods  or services. The market may be telling us that, despite the short-term gloom  over interest rates, the long-term economic picture looks better, not worse.    Europe's Not So Bad, Either: Everybody knows Europe will be an exciting  investment arena in the 1990s. But the expected economic changes there will  undoubtedly produce a lot of losers as well. This is a time for particularly  careful stock picking, not rushing wholesale into European markets, says  Penelope Dobkin, manager of Fidelity Group's Europe Fund.    Dobkin has run the Europe Fund since 1986. She has $370 million under  management, spread among 90 stocks. Her track record: Up 25.93% in the 12  months ended March 31, compared to 22.37% for the average Europe-focused fund.  In the first quarter, Dobkin's fund gained 1.61%, compared to 0.82% for the  average Europe fund. (The average U.S. stock fund lost 2.31%.)    Dobkin says the euphoria over West Germany's future isn't a lot of hype. But  forget the talk about an avalanche of profits falling on West German companies  from Eastern European business ventures. "That's not going to come before  1995," she said, especially given the costs of absorbing East Germany into the  West.    The reason to buy West German stocks now is that they're severely undervalued  just based on their underlying assets, including land, Dobkin said. U.S. stocks  went through an asset-value phase in the late '80s. In West Germany, only now  are the usually secretive companies beginning to disclose what their assets are  worth.    The asset value of West German companies is estimated at about 1 trillion West  German marks, Dobkin said. The value of their stocks on the open market,  meanwhile, is about half that. Pretty simple math, Dobkin figures. And those  asset values are destined to rise, she said, because West German economic  growth will be Europe's locomotive over the next few years.    She has 19% of her fund's assets invested in West German stocks, the heaviest  weighting in any European nation. And she's sticking with the blue chips --  industrial giants such as Siemens and Veba, and big banks such as Deutsche  Bank.    "The average European portfolio is overweighted with smaller stocks," Dobkin  said. But she thinks that, while the smaller issues were the success stories of  the 1980s, the big names will be the hot stocks of the 1990s. One good reason:  "Just look at what the Japanese are buying," she said. Japanese investors are  taken with Europe, and just as they played the blue chip names in the United  States in the late '80s, they're looking for the same kind of stocks in West  Germany.    After Germany, the heaviest stock weightings in Dobkin's portfolio are France  (13% of assets), Britain (13%), the Netherlands (13%), Switzerland (6%), Spain  (5%) and Norway (4%).    She is most worried about Britain. She recently slashed her holdings there (the  weighting was 24% on Jan. 1). Dobkin sees great risk of high inflation in  Britain leading to a recession later this year. And the market doesn't reflect  the major possibility of a liberal Labor government coming to power by 1992,  she said.      THE EXPORT BOOM    While the U.S. economy slowed last year, overseas demand for U.S. goods soared  -- a trend that has continued into 1990, helping support corporate earnings.

Analysts said the decline in prices signaled the return of traders who had  taken to the sidelines during the emergency meeting of the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva and who see little hope in the near  term for an easing of the crude oil glut.    On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower;  copper futures fell; precious metals advanced, and livestock and meat futures  were mixed.

headline:   BOOK REVIEW;    SOME EXTRAORDINARY FAMILY SNAPSHOTS;    FAMILY PICTURES BY SUE MILLER HARPER &amp; ROW $19.95, 330 PAGES   
text:   "Family Pictures" is literature by exorcism. When the writer is in complete  control of the material, as Sue Miller is here, the reader also will be  possessed, oblivious to claims outside the hermetic world of the book until the  last page is turned.    If a writer can accomplish this transference with virtually no plot and the  most skeletal structure, with a cast of only eight principal characters and a  setting no more exotic than an upper-middle-class Chicago neighborhood, you  know you're in splendid company.    The effect an autistic boy has on his parents and siblings is Miller's subject:  a tough, uncompromising theme that must be deeply felt and thoroughly absorbed.  Miller keeps the medical details to a minimum. You know that Randall Eberhardt  is a physically attractive child; that his usual silent passivity is broken  only rarely by uncontrollable destructive outbursts, mostly against things but  occasionally -- and terrifyingly -- against the persons who love him.    This is not a book about the pathology of autism, but about the way Randall's  condition forms, alters and skews his parents' marriage and the directions  taken by his brothers and sisters. There are two older children -- Lyddie and  Macklin -- and three younger girls, born to prove that Randall was a cosmic  accident for which no one is responsible.    Although the story is told from several points of view, the dominant voice is  Nina's -- first of "the last straws," the biggest "little pitcher of health."  Those are their father's pet names for his small daughters, and the irony is  apparent even to the tots.    Nina is strategically placed to be the spokesperson; after Randall, before her  small sisters. She's the living demonstration that all can be well again, and  from earliest childhood, that obligation motivates and burdens her. Randall  remains remote, a powerful catalyst working almost invisibly upon the others,  virtually inert until the precarious equilibrium is disturbed.    As the Eberhardt story unfolds over the 4 1/2 decades beginning with David and  Lainey's marriage in 1940, we realize Randall is the binding force that holds  the family together. When the wrenching decision is finally reached to place  him in a more structured environment, the tightly woven family fabric unravels.  Once he's gone, the older two children suddenly find themselves directionless,  with no substitute for the constraints Randall provided. The glue that had  turned the three younger girls into a self-sufficient unit dissolves, and they  drift apart.    One day, in a burst of directionless rage, Randall pushes his mother down the  stairs. By then, David and Lainey have separated. Sarah, the youngest, phones  her father, who responds immediately, cleaning Lainey's deep head wound,  calming Randall and getting him to bed, staying the night.    Indirectly, we've learned enough about autism to realize that such outbursts  are more frequent after puberty, triggered by the same hormones that turn  docile children into sullen rebels. As David said so long ago, there was no  other Randall inside this one, struggling to emerge; no love great enough to  create a person inside the shell.    And so Randall goes away, to the best of the available places. Macklin goes,  too -- to Vietnam, after drifting through a semester at Harvard. Unmoored, with  no further reason to be exceptional, Mack longs for the humdrum. He returns  safely from the war and buys a bar.    Beautiful, gifted Lyddie settles for a series of stopgap jobs. Nina, our  narrator, escapes into a marriage so suffocatingly bland that she must leave  her husband to find the more demanding life for which her childhood prepared  her.    The saga emerges from vignettes -- snaps of Lainey and David young and happy  with their babies and friends; overheard recriminations leading to their  separation; glimpses of the children at school, at play and in love; apparently  unposed, candid pictures cataloguing the manners and mores of the last 40  years, revealing character more honestly than any formal portraits could.  That's all, but Miller has made "Family Pictures" as compelling as life itself.    Next: Carolyn See reviews "Hype and Glory" by William Goldman.

headline:   TROUBLES AT THE JOFFREY;    DANCE REVIEW;    A GLITZY PREMIERE MASKS WOES   
text:   On the surface, it looked like another op'nin', another show for the Joffrey  Ballet.    Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the typical triple bill began  with some old neo-classical kitsch and ended with a spangly new ode to the  faded glories of vaudeville. Both instant crowd-pleasers were choreographed by  the official keeper of the Joffrey flame, Gerald Arpino.    In between came a knowing nod in the direction of dainty romanticism.  Eclecticism remains a Joffrey speciality.    The dancing, throughout, reflected the customary high spirits complemented by  reasonably high finesse. Although the faces in the company change, the gutsy  attitudes do not.    Still, it couldn't have been business as usual on this occasion. Few in the  dressy, unruly, non-capacity audience for this non-gala gala may have known it,  but the show went on while the company confronted chronic, possibly fatal,  turmoil behind the scenes.    Financial crises clouded the horizon. The trustees and administrators were  engaged in savage internal warfare. Loyalties were polarized.    Resignations and defections had begun to pile up. Accusations and  counter-accusations echoed from coast to coast. Arpino's continuing role as  artistic director languished in doubt. So, for that matter, did the immediate  survival of the Arpino-Joffrey oeuvre as we have long known and sometimes loved  it.    Ironically, the inaugural festivities at the Music Center accentuated the  negative in matters of repertory. Arpino's "Italian Suite," first seen in 1983,  is little more than a collection of amiable cliches. The frantic cheer is  filtered through cloying rosy lights, and propelled by speedy steps and  athletic contortions that contradict the impulses of Wolf-Ferrari gurgling in  the pit.    Nothing offensive can happen here. Nothing memorable can happen, either. It is  all too pat, too predictable, too eager to attract at the most obvious level.    At least "Italian Suite" isn't pretentious. That cannot be said of "The  Pantages and the Palace Present 'TWO-A-DAY.' "    Arpino's latest show-biz extravaganza is a splashy, glitzy, costly, witless  production number. Also a massive bore.    It looks nice, in its defiantly tasteless and nostalgic way. It lacks focus,  however. It lacks purpose. It lacks balletic interest. It lacks point, not to  mention a point of view.    It pretends to revere the traditions of the all-American variety show, as  sandwiched between sagas of the Silver Screen. The idea isn't original, but  there may be some life in it yet.    Not here.    Arpino can't seem to decide if he wants to glorify the past or to satirize it.  He doesn't seem sure if he wants his eager cast to dance or just to mug. He  ends up falling between most of the stylistic chairs for 40 ponderous minutes.    The first damaging clues come from the pit. The choreographer -- who is also  credited with the "conception" -- could have exhumed some great period ditties.  On the other hand, he could have commissioned a new score predicated on  illuminating parody. Instead, he engaged Elliot Kaplan to rework some limp  platitudes written by none other than Rebekah Harkness, a patron of the arts  who was blessed with more money than talent. Some of her money, not  incidentally, underwrote this dubious venture.    The proceedings begin irrelevantly with the final teary snippets of "A Star Is  Born," the 1937 version featuring Janet Gaynor. The printed program then  promises "The Voice" of "The Incomparable Mr. Tony Randall." It eluded these  ears.    The parade of impersonations begins as Jodie Gates invokes Sally Rand's fans  but not her bare skin. Elizabeth Parker and six attending swells do an ersatz  tap routine. Time dips back to Mack Sennett for a fatuous bathing-beauty number  in which Peter Narbutas flexes his biceps while flirting with a bump and grind.    Julie Janus and Tom Mossbrucker indulge in a would-be exotic harem duet in  which the hero suggests more of Valentino than Nijinsky. Beatriz Rodriguez,  eternally typecast as the sizzling Latina, leads a sort-of-Spanish  divertissement. Carole Valleskey undulates filmy butterfly wings in the manner  of Loie Fuller. Tina LeBlanc, petite and eternally innocent, descends from the  flies on a wired crescent moon in a fruitless fabrication of the sexy Marilyn  Miller mystique.    Finally, and not a moment too soon, everyone comes back for a valedictory  Charleston climax. It was choreographed not by Arpino but by Louis Johnson.    The participants give their all for their boss in the various thankless  charades. There is a lot of talent here, most of it smothered in gook. For  better and worse, Gerald Arpino may just be the Andrew Lloyd Webber of dance.    For at least one ungrateful viewer, the greatest satisfactions of the evening  involved the ancient lightweight charms of Arthur Saint-Leon's "La Vivandiere."  In the pas de six, the exquisite Tina LeBlanc and the mercurial Edward Stierle  were fleetly seconded by Cameron Baden, Jodie Gates, Cynthia Giannini and Kim  Sagani.    Here one could savor ballet without padding, without puffery, without false  sentiment and without gimmickry. It was reassuring.

headline:   MOVIE REVIEW;    'HAPPY' ECHOES '30S COMEDY   
text:   "Happy Together" (selected theaters) has the smarts to take a clever idea and  run with it. Serious-minded would-be playwright Chris (Patrick Dempsey) and  blithe-spirited aspiring actress Alex (Helen Slater), because of her unisex  name, wind up as freshman roommates in a university dorm. The result is "The  Odd Couple" turned into a brisk and bubbly romantic comedy.    Writer Craig J. Nevius has written wonderful roles for Dempsey and Slater, two  of the most attractive, talented young actors on the screen today, and they in  turn come through with some of their best work yet under Mel Damski's shrewd,  deft direction. "Happy Together" is a pleasure in the tradition of '30s  screwball comedy -- a genre many attempt but few succeed with -- in which  fantastic situations evoke genuine emotion.    Slater is a delight as she takes on the time-honored task of making a certified  pain-in-the-neck irresistible. Having settled in before Chris arrives, the  mercurial Alex has transformed their room into cluttered pastel paradise with a  plastic water tub in the center of the room. Her extroverted personality and  whimsical ways drive Chris nuts, yet in the three weeks it takes him to arrange  a room transfer he's ready to cancel it.    Therein lies the persuasive charm of the film. Within that period Chris begins  to understand that he's a stick figure -- that, as his drama professor (Marius  Weyers) points out, he can't write unless he's lived -- and that Slater's  flamboyance masks the vulnerability of an unloved child, the product of a  broken marriage. (According to Alex, her rich father ranks his Mercedes before  her.) At the same time, it starts to dawn upon Alex that she might do well to  take both her studies and Alex more seriously.    Weyers, who starred in "The Gods Must Be Crazy," gives the film dimension, as  does Barbara Babcock, entirely believable as Chris and Alex's rigorous acting  teacher, who attempts to break through Alex's superficiality as an actress. Dan  Schneider shines as Chris's bright, eccentric pal, and Kevin Hardesty is  amusing as Alex's rocker fiance. "Happy Together" (rated PG-13) is modest,  unpretentious -- and surprisingly touching underneath the giddiness.

headline:   MOVIE REVIEW;    'HIRE' A SUBTLE, SPLENDID STORY OF SEDUCTION   
text:   With his round black hat, pale face and black coat, Monsieur Hire, from the  splendid movie of the same name, might have stepped straight out of a painting  by Magritte; you half expect to be able to see blue sky and clouds straight  through him.    Instead, this small, mysterious bachelor is at the heart of a luminous and  hypnotic new film (at the Music Hall) made from one of the novels by the  always-reliable Georges Simenon. Michel Blanc plays Hire and Sandrine Bonnaire  plays his prey, the sensual young woman he watches every night from his window  opposite hers in their old Paris apartment building.    Bonnaire and Blanc are an extraordinary pairing: the warm, carelessly seductive  Alice and the reclusive, almost universally disliked Monsieur Hire, who spends  most of his nights in the dark, listening to Brahms and staring at the yellow  rectangle of light that is her apartment. What makes it creepy is that after  the startling night when Alice catches Monsieur Hire at his compulsion, she  doesn't report him to the police. Instead, she uses her power over him to draw  him into her life until they are both held by a delicately manipulated bond of  eroticism.    It's frightening for us, since we know that the milky-skinned, deeply emotional  Hire is a suspect in the murder of the 22-year-old girl from the apartment next  to his. An almost fatherly inspector (the craggy-faced Andre Wilms) is on the  case, dropping in at odd moments to hound Hire, while at the same time director  Patrice Leconte drops visual hints -- a white mark on Hire's black suit -- that  recall "M" and Peter Lorre's psychopathic killer.    The film's last major character is the thuggish Emile (Luc Thuillier), plainly  less in love with Alice than she is with him. And that is enough about the  story, which is a skein of subtleties played with the utmost deliberation and  intelligence. (The film is rated PG-13, since its eroticism is almost entirely  suggested, not shown.)    The actors are fascinating. Blanc's work has so many different levels and  layers as he builds first sympathy for Hire, then fear about his motives, that  it needs to be seen more than once to appreciate the depth involved.    Alice is one of Bonnaire's rare sunny characters, a country girl from Provence  with predictably lousy judgment about big-city men, but one who's comfortable  with her sexuality and blessedly unneurotic. Bonnaire has now shed every ounce  of the puppy fat she had in "A Nos Amours" and in "Vagabond"; with the contours  of her face defined this way, she's become even more interesting to watch and  she's always been a compelling actress.    "Monsieur Hire" is marvelously all-of-a-piece. Denis Lenoir's lighting camera  work sets a mood that's cool and detached; as a result, in retrospect this  seems to be a film played out in bluish moonlight. The atmosphere is further  deepened by the faintly ominous musical score of British avant-gardist Michael  Nyman, known also for his music for the films of Peter Greenaway.    Director Leconte, who was also co-adapter with Patrick Dewolf, has deliberately  made the period and even the location undefinable, an interesting idea that  connects his film subliminally to French policiers of the '30s and '40s, to the  Polanski of "The Tenant" or to early Hitchcock. Leconte also seems to like  visual puns, like the one in which Hire, eating a soft-boiled egg, is shot from  above and behind, the top of the egg and the top of his perfectly rounded  balding head making an exact match.

headline:   MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;    ENSEMBLE PLAYS WORKS BY FACULTY COMPOSERS   
text:   There are lots of university composers writing lots of music, some of it very  good. But much of the music exhibits a kind of sonic anemia, the symptoms of  which include dullness of rhythm, textural sameness and a marked avoidance of  drama.    There were at least three case studies of the malady on display Wednesday at  Cal State Northridge, the site of a faculty composers recital.    Hardly affected by the syndrome, however, was Daniel Kessner's Chamber Concerto  No. 4. There wasn't much melodic activity of interest, but a good deal of  rhythmic, timbral and above all textural variety, and Kessner's sense of  proportion proved unusually keen. Under the baton of the composer, seven  members of the CSN New Music Ensemble gave a surprisingly ragged performance.    Severely smitten with academic tediosis was William Toutant's "Small Suite for  Piano." With its ceaseless motoric rhythm and lack of melodic direction, the  work imparted no sense of purpose, Kary Kramer's attentive reading  notwithstanding.    Frank Campo's Concerto for Piano With Winds and Percussion displayed more  textural and timbral variety, but one grew tired of the same old brass barks  and tone clusters repeated again and again. Francoise Regnat brought energy and  virtuosity to the solo part, and members of the CSN Wind Ensemble, conducted by  Kessner, played serviceably.    One could find rhythmic interest in Aurelio de la Vega's "Magias e  Invenciones," a setting of five poems by Gaston Baquero -- but only in the  piano part (superbly played by Delores Stevens). The vocal part, delivered  without much poetic insight by soprano Anne Marie Ketchum, consisted of a  series of slow, disjunct and rather amorphous melodic lines. TERRY McQUILKIN

headline:   MOVABLE FEASTS: SUNSET GRILL: A NEIGHBORLY RESTAURANT IN SANTA MONICA   
text:   Certain new restaurants careen into a neighborhood as if they were crashing a  party, so at odds is their aesthetic and their price range with the milieu.  Other places surface and, right away, feel like an old friend. The Sunset  Grill, just 4 months old on the corner of Ocean Park Boulevard and 17th Street,  is a little bit of both.    It's set in a still-sleepy part of Santa Monica that looks almost the same as  it might have in 1953. But swivel around and check out what's written on the  the Sunset Grill's blackboard menu (grilled duck sausage, spicy Jamaican  chicken breast) and you know it's the end of the century.    I was placing my to-go order when a woman with a Liverpudlian accent walked in.  "D'ya have some of that rice me mum luvs so much?"    "The basmati with raisins? I'm sorry," owner Jean Lorda said. "We change dishes  every day."    The Liverpudlian asked for a taste of the tortellini salad and the ratatouille.  "Nice place ya got," she said. "But where are the school kids gonna go? This  used to be their burger-and-fries joint."    Well, the kids across the street will still find hamburgers (juicy, solid) and  fries (pale, frozen, forgettable). They'll also find low prices, a mom-and-pop  feeling (Jean's wife, Frances, is usually around) and a couple of traces of  France.    A businessman appeared. "I'd like that great sandwich I had last week."    Lorda looked up from the Caesar salad he was tossing -- a fine Caesar it is,  with a jolt of garlic and really crunchy croutons -- and squinted his eyes.  "Didn't you have the Royal Vegetarian?" (A splendid choice, I had it the next  time I came in: a tier of unusually sweet roasted peppers, streams of velvety  marinated Japanese eggplant, sun-dried tomato and toasted pine nuts; it's  served with a perky balsamic vinegared green salad for $4.95.)    Jean Lorda, who hails from Biarritz, makes a homey linguine basquaise, full of  sweet and slow-cooked tomatoes, onions and green pepper. The only thing I  didn't like about this dish -- and about Sunset Grill -- is that the sauce  leaked through its dumb plastic foam container onto the carpet of my car. (My  post-Earth Day pitch: Tell all the take-out shop owners you encounter to switch  to aluminum tins with cardboard tops; they can be used at home over and over  again.)    Hand-cut, homey vegetable soup is always on the stove here. And salads have  perky, clear-tasting vegetables -- though they tend to be on the under-seasoned  side, and a few need to go the last yard. Potato salad tasted merely of  mayonnaise and undercooked spud. Noodles with tarragon and caraway-seeded  sausage needs a more vigorous finish.    The sausage plates, all $4.25, are served with lots of wonderful smoky, cooked  red cabbage slivered confetti thin and dolled up with a sweet vinegar brew.  There are lean veal sausages, fennel-dense duck (from Jody Maroni) and even a  maple sausage served with potatoes. (Breakfast-to-go starts at 7:30 a.m.)    Grilled skinless chicken breast, marinated in olive oil, is juicy and attended  by hot ratatouille. The Jamaican chicken has a hint of coriander, cumin,  cinnamon and mango Champagne vinegar marinade; it's served with sweet grilled  pineapple and mellow, raisin-studded curried rice.    A research psychologist just told me that nutmeg has been found to be a calming  substance. Maybe that's why this namby-pamby-looking pasta primavera (little  bits of zucchini, really sweet carrots, a toss of peas in a warm bath of nutmeg  cream sauce) tastes so comforting.    The neighborhood has found out about Lorda's lovely homemade $2 creme caramel.  The first batch is often gone by lunch and the second isn't ready until supper  time. The only thing to do is to become a regular. Then, perhaps, Jean Lorda  will sock one away for you. Like I said, it's a neighborly place.     Sunset Grill, 1701 Ocean Park Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 450-7546. Open Monday  through Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Checks and cash only. Parking available.

headline:   RESTAURANT REVIEW;    BISTRO AT FANTASIA: A NICE SLICE OF CONTINENTAL   
text:   The City of Industry looks on the map like a gerrymandered electoral district  hugging the Union Pacific tracks. It sounds like a . . . well, a terribly  industrial sort of place.    There's more to it than that, though. At Azusa Avenue there's the impressive  acreage of the Puente Hills Mall. Most evenings, a line of brightly dressed  people is likely to be waiting outside a glittering nightclub called Fantasia,  right across Albatross Street from that mighty mall. Adjoining Fantasia is a  restaurant, the Bistro at Fantasia, which has lured a chef from Beaudry's, the  old Continental place in downtown L.A.    This should tell us two things. One, Industry is up-and-coming, no longer  willing to accept culinary dependency on other cities. Two, Fantasia expects  its nightclubbers to go for Continental food with modern touches (though the  fact that the dining room is wheelchair-accessible suggests it isn't relying  entirely on the dance crowd).    There is clearly some intentional accommodation to nightclub dining habits.  Light foods such as sandwiches and omelets are available from the lunch hour  clear up until closing time. All the pastas are available in either half or  full portions.    The specials can be a good deal more adventuresome than the regular Continental  menu, sometimes exhibiting Southwestern or Cajun tendencies (though there is a  blackened catfish on the regular menu). But not always. The special might be  something as safe and Continental as sauteed sirloin tips; actually, rather  like sirloin tips lightly stir-fried with shallots and zucchini. It satisfies  the traditional Continental requirement that food should be tender above every  other consideration.    As Continental restaurants go, the Bistro is often very pleasing. For one  appetizer, marinated artichoke leaves are mixed with crab meat. For another,  huge shrimp are floated on two sauces, ketchup spiked with a little horseradish  and a sort of sour cream tartar sauce. The crab-and-jack-cheese quesadilla is  impressively large.    And there are nice touches. A steak sandwich comes heavy-laden with fried  onions and mushrooms. The soup of the day might be accompanied by a couple of  little triangular pies wrapped in filo ("spanakopita," the waiters call them,  though technically they're boreks), one filled with sauteed mushrooms and the  other with densely packed little shrimp.    But of course this isn't exactly food you'd drive a million miles for. A nice  broiled lobster tail weighs a good 12 ounces; a nice piece of swordfish is  grilled and served with a little herb butter; nice pieces of beef, shrimp, fish  and chicken are grilled and served on a tomato coulis that tastes a tiny bit  like barbecue sauce. Rarely do you reach for a stronger word than nice.    And the kitchen drops the ball often enough. The rigatoni with ricotta and  sun-dried tomatoes has little or none of the promised basil, and lies on the  plate like a slab of drying library paste. Tournedos is a slightly overdone  filet mignon served on top of fried apple slices in a raisin and cider sauce.  It's an over-sweet dish in the Continental tradition of sticking apples where  they don't belong.    The desserts are standard issue: Lemon cake and carrot cake in the usual tall  and heavily frosted style, a cheesecake with a strange caramel aftertaste.  There is an intense chocolate cake like a brownie with thick fudge frosting,  and possibly you might find a special of strawberries and custard sauce  sandwiched between sheets of puff pastry, resting on a pool of milk chocolate.    The Bistro isn't everything, but it proves one thing. You can have a good time  in Industry. Or anyway, a nice time.    The Bistro at Fantasia, 17500 Castleton St., City of Industry. (818) 912-6065.  Open for lunch and dinner daily. Full bar. Parking lot. All major credit cards  accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$65.

text:   "I'm not a nightclub singer," announced Terry Cole-Whittaker at the start of  her Cafe Largo set on Wednesday. "What I am is a transformational cheerleader."    That said, the ever-smiling ex-televangelist launched into a new cabaret act in  which she sang about divinity and hosted a Vegas-style consciousness-raising  revue before a capacity crowd of doting devotees.    Billed as a preview of her planned television show, the club date also featured  performances by a metaphysical comic, an astrologer and a transcendental  meditation teacher.    Cole-Whittaker, dressed in a sequined white crepe gown, worked the room like a  New Age Doris Day, hugging customers and belting out sincere but stilted  versions of uplifting standards like "Look to the Rainbow" and "When You Wish  Upon a Star" to piano accompaniment.    Her warm demeanor contrasted sharply with the materialistic guru image she  developed during her divine prosperity days. And though her vocal talents are  limited, the fans appeared to savor every note.    Between songs, the former Mrs. California offered anecdotes about her spiritual  progress and pampered followers with esoteric banter about Tarot cards, trance  work and animal totems. "Everyone is a flower," she said, passing out tiny buds  to the patrons. "Keep cross-pollinating."    Audience participation played a key role in the program. At one point, members  of the audience volunteered affirmations into an open microphone, providing  insights like "We do not die, we graduate."    But as the two-hour show progressed, the obtuse music and humor began to drag.  Still, nothing seemed to faze Cole-Whittaker.

headline:   POP REVIEWS ;    TRIP SHAKESPEARE CARVES ITS OWN NICHE   
text:   Honest romanticism and winking hipness aren't supposed to work together. So how  do you explain the L.A. debut of Trip Shakespeare at Club Lingerie on  Wednesday? How a simple fairy tale turned into a novelty dance called the  slacks, how a twisted comic-book adventure became a hilarious rhyming farmland  epic of, well, near-Shakespearean proportions? And, most important, how  youthful irreverence did nothing to diminish the bare sentimentality of a  closing ballad, or vice versa?    The Minneapolis quartet is obviously a band that's willing and able to carve  out its own distinct and rewarding niche. Maybe if L.A.'s wacky metal parodists  Redd Kross had been weaned on Neil Young and the Band instead of Kiss and the  Partridge Family, they might sound something like this. The harmonies and  emotions are heartland-pure and plain, but the attitude is  television-generation-hip. The trick of the Trip is that it's never snide -- an  accomplishment that has eluded virtually all who have tried for this chemistry  (not that many have tried). And, not incidentally, the band writes great hooks,  and it rocks. Maybe the name says it all. STEVE HOCHMAN

headline:   BUSH ASKS NEW A-ARMS CUTBACK;    SUPERPOWERS: THE PRESIDENT PROPOSES REDUCING OR ELIMINATING GROUND-BASED  NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN EUROPE. HE CONCEDES WORRY ON FUTURE SOVIET MILITARY  RESURGENCE.   
text:   President Bush proposed a new treaty Thursday that could reduce or eliminate  ground-based, short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, a step the Administration  hopes will allow the Soviet Union to live more easily with a united Germany's  presence in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    Bush acknowledged that he does "worry about the military resurgence of some  kind inside the Soviet Union." Soviet generals, wary about the rapid pace of  warming superpower relations, appear to have forced civilian leaders to back  away from proposed arms control deals, senior Administration officials say.    And even though Bush denied a direct link between those concerns and his new  arms control plan, Administration officials indicated they hope that offering  to negotiate away the thousands of U.S. nuclear artillery pieces and  short-range missiles in the NATO's arsenal will ease the Soviet military's  concerns about a united Germany's membership in the alliance.    "We ought to look at ways our objectives can be accomplished that reduce the  friction or enhance the acceptability on the part of the Soviet Union as much  as possible," a senior Administration official said in briefing reporters on  Bush's plan.    The initial Soviet response to Bush's proposal was positive, with Tass, the  official Soviet news agency, declaring that the new American proposal had been  a Soviet idea in the first place.    Bush announced his new arms plan during a 45-minute press conference in which  he also:    * Said he is looking for "goodwill gestures" he can offer Iran, citing in  particular U.S. efforts to uncover information about four Iranian diplomats  believed to have been killed in Lebanon in 1982. But, he added, "there were no  behind-the-scenes negotiations that will come out" that led to the recent  release from Lebanon of two American hostages.    * Called, again, for Congress to give him more flexibility in doling out  foreign aid.    * Expressed "disappointment" with the results of his policy toward China but  insisted that he has "no apologies" for his attempts to avoid a break in  relations between the two countries after the Chinese leadership smashed the  nation's democracy movement last June. "Preserving a relationship with the  People's Republic of China in the broad global context is important," he said.    * Joked about the heckling that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev received  during the May Day parade Tuesday. "He ought to come join some of the parades I  go to around here," Bush said. "That's the fruits of democracy. He's just  learning."    But, Bush acknowledged, Gorbachev is "under extraordinary pressure at home,  particularly on the economy, and I do from time to time worry about a takeover  that will set back the whole process."    In Brussels, where Secretary of State James A. Baker III briefed NATO foreign  ministers on the new arms control proposals, Baker and NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner said that NATO allies are unanimous in their support.    But, as Baker and other officials made clear, several fundamental parts of the  new proposal remain undecided, including whether the eventual goal of the new  talks will be total elimination of ground-based nuclear weapons in Europe, as  many Europeans have urged, or only a reduction in the superpower arsenals.    "We will have to work out the specifics of our negotiating position internally  (within the Administration) and with our allies," Baker said. Many decisions  about the new plan will not be made until a NATO summit that Bush said will  take place in late June or early July.    Bush's new arms plan is part of a basic reevaluation of NATO defense strategy  to adapt to what the President called "the transformed Europe of the 1990s."    The new proposal has two parts. First, effective immediately, the United States  will stop modernizing nuclear artillery shells in Europe and cease work on  modernizing the short-range Lance missiles now used by NATO. Next, the  Administration will ask the Soviet Union to begin negotiating a new treaty on  removing the short-range weapons now in place.    Currently, NATO has about 680 Lance warheads and more than 1,400 nuclear  artillery shells, most of which are based in West Germany.    With the collapse of Communist governments in Eastern Europe and the effective  end of the Warsaw Pact as a military force, plans to modernize short-range  weapons have been increasingly unpopular in Europe and on Capitol Hill.    The current weapons have ranges no greater than 75 miles and therefore would be  guaranteed to explode within the territory of what are now friendly, democratic  nations.    Bush "only performed the last rites" for a modernization plan that was "already  dead," said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.).    "We have to realize that the situation in Europe has changed," West German  Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told reporters in Brussels. "The  American proposal is a contribution to that."    The Administration continues to oppose strongly the removal of all nuclear  weapons from Europe, believing that they are essential to maintain a stable  military balance. At the same time that it negotiates possible elimination of  ground-based weapons, it is likely to push for an increased emphasis on  air-launched cruise missiles to maintain NATO's nuclear deterrent, U.S.  officials say.    NATO officials believe that the ground-based weapons, particularly nuclear  artillery, are of limited use and could be eliminated entirely if the Soviets  would agree to do the same. Baker, in fact, told reporters in Brussels that  Washington might decide to begin removing some short-range nuclear weapons  before a treaty is negotiated.    The United States also might continue producing Lance missiles and nuclear  artillery shells for use outside of Europe, he said, noting that no decision  has been made on either of those issues.    U.S. and Soviet negotiators are working at conferences on three arms treaties:  The strategic arms reduction talks, which are designed to reduce the  superpowers' arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons; the talks on conventional  forces in Europe, aimed at reducing non-nuclear weapons and armies in Europe,  and meetings on an international pact aimed at banning chemical weapons.    The new talks on short-range missiles would begin once a conventional forces  treaty is signed. Baker said that the United States is hopeful that such an  agreement can be reached before the end of this year. But, he conceded, the  talks "have not proceeded as rapidly as we might have hoped."    "We have some proposals on the table and we are waiting for some answers from  the Soviet Union," Baker said.    Once those talks are complete, the United States is likely to begin a new round  of negotiations on conventional forces to accommodate a Soviet desire to see a  cap set on the size of the German army, according to the senior official who  briefed reporters on Bush's plans.    The Soviets have tried to bring up that issue in the so-called two-plus-four  talks about German unification, a move that the United States has resisted. The  foreign ministers of West and East Germany, the United States, the Soviet  Union, Britain and France meet Saturday in Bonn to begin the formal talks after  several weeks of lower-level discussions.    The United States, Baker said, will seek to limit the talks to the status of  Berlin and other matters left over from the occupation of Germany that followed  World War II. He said that the United States will not allow those talks to  become a forum for debating Germany's membership in NATO, which Baker called  "not negotiable."    NATO's foreign ministers voted unanimously Thursday to approve alliance  membership for Germany after completion of the reunification process and agreed  not to expand NATO military forces into territory now part of East Germany.    Bush said in his press conference that he hopes the conventional forces treaty  could be signed late this year at a meeting of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation body that includes the United States,  Canada, the Soviet Union and all European states except Albania. The conference  would meet in Paris, while the Administration has offered to host a preliminary  foreign ministers meeting of the group in New York in September.    The conference is best known for the 1975 Helsinki Accords that ratified the  postwar boundaries of Europe and adopted a variety of human rights measures,  most of them virtually ignored by the Soviet Union and its Eastern European  allies until recently.    Baker said that the 35-nation conference, once scorned by Washington as a  debating society, looms large in the U.S. view of a post-Cold War Europe. He  had suggested to the NATO foreign ministers "a number of ideas for transforming  CSCE from a process into more of an institution," Baker said.    For instance, he said, the 35-nation group could adopt mechanisms for resolving  disputes among member countries, conduct regular political consultations, and  establish a procedure for members to obtain clarifications of unusual military  activities.    Lauter reported from Washington and Kempster from Brussels. Times staff writer  John-Thor Dahlburg, in Moscow, also contributed to this report.      BUSH HIGHLIGHTS    Nuclear Weapons    Bush canceled plans for further modernizing NATO nuclear weapons in Europe. "As  democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops return home, there is less  need for nuclear systems of the shortest range," he said.    Hostages    Bush expressed hope that Iran views recent U.S. efforts as gestures of goodwill  and said "there may be other things we can do" to help expedite the release of  captive Americans in Lebanon.    Lithuania    Bush said he had no qualms about meeting with Lithuania's prime minister, even  though the United States has not recognized the republic as an independent  nation. He also sees no U.S. role in its bid to break from Moscow.    Soviet Union    Bush said that vocal opposition, such as the jeering directed at Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the May Day parade in Red Square, is  something the Kremlin leader had better get used to. "That's the fruits of  democracy," Bush said. "He's just learning."

headline:   PRO-DEMOCRACY SHIP SAILS FOR CHINA, POLITICAL STORM   
text:   It is just an old ship, once used by British oceanographers and later  discarded. But its new name, owners, destination and mission have caused the  United States and several other governments to keep track of its progress as  closely as if it were a nuclear submarine.    The new owners are a Paris-based group of Chinese dissidents and their  supporters seeking to bring democratic change to the Communist regime in  Beijing. A few months ago, the exiles bought the 1,200-ton, 237-foot vessel,  christened it the Goddess of Democracy and outfitted it with powerful radio  equipment.    Now, the ship is churning through the seas of Southeast Asia, headed for the  coast of China. There, from international waters, the dissidents plan to launch  a series of round-the-clock broadcasts beaming pro-democracy messages to the  Chinese mainland.    China is not amused. The Chinese government has been making menacing statements  about the Goddess of Democracy, leaving open the possibility that it may try to  seize or take some military action against the ship if it begins offshore radio  transmissions.    "It is something we cannot tolerate," a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign  Ministry said last month. ". . . We believe that countries friendly towards  China will not support the activities of the ship."    Because of China's warnings, officials in Washington, London, Paris, Taipei and  Singapore have been working overtime to make sure that the voyage of the God  dess of Democracy doesn't turn into a serious diplomatic or even military  incident.    On Wednesday, the ship's crew shelved previously announced plans to dock in the  Taiwan port of Keelung. U.S. sources confirmed that the Bush Administration  earlier had voiced concern to Taiwan about a possible military confrontation  with China over the ship. Christophe Nick, a French journalist aboard the  vessel, told reporters that the Keelung port call was canceled because "the  pressure on Taiwan is very hard."    Similarly, David Wilson, the British governor of Hong Kong, said Thursday that  the Goddess of Democracy will be denied entry to Hong Kong.    "We have a policy here of making sure that Hong Kong is not used as a  battlefield for other people's political battles," Wilson told reporters. "It  would be quite inconsistent with that policy to have a ship of that sort coming  into Hong Kong."    Hong Kong, a British colony, reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and is  sensitive about relations with Beijing.    One Bush Administration official branded the effort to launch pro-democracy  broadcasts to the Chinese mainland as "provocative." U.S. officials have been  checking to make sure no American citizens are aboard. The ship's crew is  French and there are journalists from France and Taiwan on board.    For American officials, the main worry is that the ship could touch off a new  round of friction between China and Taiwan, which in turn would pose a serious  dilemma for the United States. Since 1979, the United States has recognized  Beijing as the legal government for all of China, but it also has maintained  friendly, informal links with the Nationalist government on Taiwan.    The Chinese dissidents have talked of having the Goddess of Democracy anchor  off the China coast near Quemoy and Matsu -- the two islands in the Taiwan  Strait that Communist Chinese forces shelled in the late 1950s in an episode  that nearly led to war.    Members of the Paris organization, A Boat for China, which is sponsoring the  ship, have acknowledged that some of the $1.5 million raised for the project  came from Taiwan. It is not clear whether this money came from the government  or independent private sources.    Citing the funding from Taiwan as evidence, the official Chinese news service  warned Sunday: "In supporting the Goddess of Democracy ship, the Taiwan  authorities are taking a new step to oppose the Chinese government and to  create disturbances on the Chinese mainland."    In recent days, China has been hammering away at the theme that broadcasts by  the Goddess of Democracy would be illegal, even if the ship stays in  international waters. China argues that the ship would be, in effect, a pirate  broadcaster, operating without the approval of the International  Telecommunications Union. In the past, the United States and several European  governments have all objected to pirate commercial stations broadcasting from  international waters adjacent to their territory.    The Voice of America beams both shortwave and AM broadcasts to China from its  huge transmitters in the Philippines, and the British Broadcasting Corp. airs  programs to China from Hong Kong. Over the past year, China has tried to jam  the VOA and BBC broadcasts, but with only intermittent success.    According to one intelligence source, last year China bought two special mobile  jamming units from France that could be used against the ship's broadcasts.    However, the Goddess of Democracy reportedly will be equipped with special  transmitting equipment, also from France, that has the capacity to overcome  these jamming units.    The radio ship was named after the haunting white statue resembling the  American Statue of Liberty that was erected in Beijing's Tian An Men Square by  pro-democracy demonstrators last spring. The vessel left the French port of La  Rochelle on March 17. Organizers have said that on the way to Asia, Chinese  ships followed the ship and harassed it.    So far, Singapore has been the only government willing to risk offending China  by helping the Goddess of Democracy. Ignoring the Chinese warnings, the island  state allowed the vessel to dock there Wednesday to refuel and take on new  supplies and 10 more French journalists.    "Singapore is a free port, and we are open to any ship calling at our port as  long as it does not violate our law or threaten our national security," said  Valerie Mok, an official of the Port of Singapore Authority.

headline:   MEXICO OFFICIAL ALLEGEDLY WAS AT KIDNAP TALK   
text:   Mexico City's current chief of police was present at one of the meetings where  the kidnaping of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena was planned, federal  prosecutors have alleged in court documents filed in Los Angeles.    The U.S. prosecutors said Javier Garcia Paniagua was among 10 men -- ranging  from drug traffickers to top Mexican law enforcement officials -- who met in  Guadalajara in October, 1984, to discuss "a DEA agent that was causing  significant problems," according to a prosecution document filed this week in  preparation for a major trial involving four suspects indicted in Camarena's  murder.    Garcia, who has not been indicted in the Camarena case, was Mexico's secretary  of state from 1976 to 1982 and later served as president of that country's  leading political party, PRI.    A controversial figure, Garcia is a former director of Mexico's federal  security police, which has seen several of its officials implicated in drug  trafficking. When he was appointed Mexico City's police chief in January, 1989,  congressional sources in Washington and U.S. law enforcement agents on both  sides of the border expressed dismay.    Garcia could not be reached for comment Thursday, but Mexico's consul general  in Los Angeles, Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, expressed surprise at the latest  U.S. allegation.    "I had never heard the name of Garcia Paniagua in this case," he said. "I don't  know where they get this information. I am going to send this to Mexico."    The disclosure is likely to further inflame tensions between the United States  and Mexico.    Mexican officials have claimed that a "rogue" unit in the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration orchestrated the April 2 kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor, who  was flown across the border by bounty hunters to face prosecution in the  Camarena case.    Mexico's attorney general, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, has continually  maintained that all of the people responsible for Camarena's slaying have been  brought to justice. About two dozen people have been convicted in Mexico of  involvement in Camarena's abduction and murder. Three people are also serving  jail terms in the United States.    The DEA has relentlessly pursued Camarena's killers, claiming that the  conspiracy to kidnap the agent involved several former high-ranking Mexican law  enforcement officials.    Camarena, who worked undercover for the DEA, had incurred the wrath of Mexican  drug kingpins by tipping authorities to vast marijuana fields in the Mexican  countryside. A subsequent raid by authorities reputedly cost traffickers  billions of dollars in lost street sales.    The alleged plotters "agreed that something would have to be done about him,"  prosecutors said.    Camarena was kidnaped off a Guadalajara street in February, 1985, and taken to  a house owned by convicted drug trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. He was  interrogated and tortured. His mutilated body was found at a ranch 65 miles  from Guadalajara a month later.    The prosecution memorandum submitted by assistant U.S. attorneys Manuel Medrano  and John Carlton states that the meeting Garcia attended was the second of two  gatherings held in October, 1984, at the home of Javier Barba Hernandez, who is  identified as a chief lieutenant of the Guadalajara narcotics cartel. Barba was  killed in a shoot-out with Mexican federal police last year.    Also attending the meeting, according to the document, were Honduran drug  kingpin Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros; Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former director of  the Mexican federal security police; Miguel Aldana Ibarra, a former director of  Interpol in Mexico; Caro Quintero; drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo;  Mexican businessman Ruben Zuno Arce; Armando Pavon Reyes, Ibarra Herrera's  chief aide, and drug trafficker Manuel Salcido.    All but Salcido, who remains a fugitive on unrelated charges, and Garcia, have  been indicted in the Camarena case.    Defense attorneys in the impending trial said this was the first time that  Garcia's name has been raised in connection with the kidnaping and that no  material on him had been turned over by prosecutors. "This raises more  questions than it answers," one defense lawyer said.    Defense attorneys were divided over the possibility that Garcia would testify  at the trial.    According to the new prosecution memo, there were a total of four meetings held  to discuss what to do about Camarena. The only reference to Garcia is that he  attended the second meeting.    At the third meeting, held in December, 1984, Camarena's photograph was passed  around and conspirators said they were "going to take care of him," the memo  said. The final meeting was held in early February, 1985, just a few days  before Camarena was kidnaped.    "Corruption amongst Mexican high-ranking government and law enforcement  officials was pervasive," according to the prosecution's trial brief. "Law  enforcement officials were on the traffickers' payroll, and facilitated matters  by providing protection for marijuana and cocaine loads, and escorting  marijuana shipments being transported and smuggled into the United States."    One defense lawyer said the trial brief "confirms, once again, that the Mexican  government is on trial."

headline:   3 OF 5 CHICKENS IN U.S. TEST FOUND TO HAVE SALMONELLA   
text:   Salmonella levels in raw chicken are much higher than previously believed,  according to a recent federal study in which almost three out of five birds  tested positive for the potentially harmful bacteria.    An independent laboratory test conducted for The Times also found the more than  50% of the locally purchased chicken showed evidence of salmonella.    The findings could be a setback for the poultry industry, which has spent the  past several years recovering from publication of 1985 federal estimates that  one in three birds were believed to carry the pathogen.    Salmonella is the leading cause of diagnosed food-borne illness in the United  States. There are an estimated 2 million to 4 million cases of Salmonellosis  each year. The disease also kills about 2,000 people annually, according to  federal health statistics.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture report found the incidence of salmonella  bacteria on fresh carcasses obtained from five processing plants in Georgia was  57.5%. Georgia was selected for the research project because it is a leading  poultry producing state.    Department of Agriculture officials downplayed the study results, saying the  salmonella levels discovered are minute and as such, the bacteria's presence  poses no health threat if the meat is properly stored, handled, cooked and  served.    Nevertheless, earlier this week the federal government approved irradiation, a  controversial food processing technique, for use on poultry as a means of  controlling salmonella and other bacteria.    USDA's critics argue that salmonella bacteria can multiply under the right  conditions, allowing just a few cells to reproduce rapidly. Illness could occur  if contaminated raw chicken comes into contact with other foods that are  consumed raw.    The sale of raw meats containing bacteria such as salmonella is not illegal.  Health officials reason that if the meat is properly refrigerated, handled and  cooked, any pathogen present will be destroyed.    California chicken producers have long maintained that the salmonella rate of  their chickens is lower than the national average due to the state's drier  growing conditions, among other factors. However, 52% of raw chickens purchased  by The Times from five Los Angeles County and six Orange County markets in  recent days tested positive for salmonella bacteria, with only Zacky Farms and  Randall Farms showing no contamination.    The sample was randomly selected from major California chicken suppliers, but  not necessarily representative of all poultry products available.    The 21 raw chicken products were tested for The Times by Michelson Laboratories  in Commerce using a procedure approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration. The procedure tests for the presence of, rather than the amount  of, salmonella.    Those brands that tested positive included 2 whole Rocky the Range Chickens  from Pine Ridge Ranch in Sebastopol; 1 whole Pride Roaster chicken from Pat  &amp; Sons Poultry in Los Angeles; 2 whole Tyson Chickens from Springdale,  Ark.; and 6 Foster Farms of Livingston products, including whole birds and  packaged parts.    Products without evidence of salmonella were 7 Zacky Farms products, including  whole birds and packaged parts, 2 Foster Farms whole birds and a package of  Randall Farms chicken breasts.    Former Foster Farms executive David M. Theno, who is now a consultant to the  firm, said that the incidence found in The Times test was much higher than  those being found in the Livingston plant. Nevertheless, he added that  consumers must keep in mind that raw chicken products are "to be cooked before  consumption, therefore any bacteria present should be killed by the heating  process."    "People think that if salmonella is in a product then you're going to  automatically get sick. That is not the case," he said. "Whether its 35% or 50%  of the chickens that contain salmonella there is nowhere near that many  illnesses (as a result)."    Bart Ehman, co-owner of Pine Ridge Ranch, which produces the antibiotic-free  Rocky The Range Chicken, said that all poultry producers battle a salmonella  problem.    "We've tested ourselves for salmonella and it does occur occasionally," he  said. "We're not worse off than anybody else and we do everything to avoid  salmonella, we really do. Sometimes, often times, when we test we do not find  salmonella. And sometimes we find some."    Corky Bennish, a principal owner of Pat &amp; Sons Poultry in Los Angeles, did  not have any comment on the lab results. However, he added that his firm did  "everything we can to keep the product wholesome according to USDA standards."    Bob Justice, executive vice president of Tyson, said that his firm's laboratory  analyses do not indicate problems with salmonella and that those Tyson chickens  purchased by The Times must have "picked up some (bacteria) along the line."    Zacky Farms declined to comment.    Industry officials, who saw a 5% decline in chicken sales after release of the  government's 1985 study, attribute the increase in salmonella levels in the  latest study to the use of more sensitive laboratory detection methods and not  to a rise in the contaminant's presence in the nation's broiler flock.    Even so, critics of the USDA say the findings indicate the agency is doing  little or nothing to reduce the incidence of salmonella in chicken.    "The USDA policy on controlling bacterial contamination (in chicken) is a  failure," said Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition  Institute, a Washington-based consumer group.    "They have been unable to get the industry to address the problems of  contamination and have given up," Leonard said. "The only thing USDA can do is  find something (irradiation) that can treat the chickens after they leave the  plant."    The recent study was done by Roy C. Blankenship, research leader of the poultry  microbiological safety unit at the USDA's Agriculture Research Service in  Athens, Ga. Blankenship said his data will appear in the August issue of  Poultry Science Journal.    Blankenship was studying a chlorine washing technique to rid birds of fecal  contamination. He studied 1,500 chickens from five Georgia processors and in  the course of the study determined that salmonella was present in 57.5% of the  birds.    "People should be aware that there is a hazard, but there are a lot of other  hazards in life and you do things to avoid them," he said. "The emphasis should  be on good food handling practices in the kitchen."    Bill Roenigk, spokesman for the National Broiler Council, which represents 90%  of the nation's chicken producers, said: "The methods (Blankenship) used were  more sensitive than previous ones. He could pick up several (microscopic) cells  of salmonella per carcass. While salmonella would be present, a few cells will  not make you ill."    Some industry observers questioned whether the five processing plants in the  Blankenship study were state-of-the-art facilities. However, Blankenship said  that the plants were well-managed, modern facilities operating within the  regulations established by the USDA and under the agency's supervision.    Even so, a top USDA official said Blankenship's results are not cause for  alarm.    "(Some critics) say that because 57% of the chickens had at least one  salmonella organism per carcass that this has public health consequences. It  does not," said Lester Crawford, director of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection  Service. "If we find just one organism, then (the entire bird) is classified as  positive for salmonella. But I don't want anyone to think you can get sick from  that. . . . Even if you ate raw chicken that contained one salmonella cell, it  wouldn't make you sick."    Crawford said health officials believe as many as 500,000 salmonella cells are  required to make a healthy person ill. However, the number needed to cause  Salmonellosis declines, sometimes dramatically, for those in the high-risk  groups including infants, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems  such as cancer or AIDS patients, for whom the disease can be fatal.    Salmonellosis can cause flu-like symptoms such as nausea, fever, abdominal  pains, headaches and vomiting.    Consumers can protect themselves from potential salmonella bacteria by cooking  chicken thoroughly, or to an internal temperature of between 175 degrees and  180 degrees. Raw chicken should be handled carefully so it does not come into  contact with other foods to be consumed uncooked, such as salad ingredients.    All surfaces -- cutting boards, knives, containers that come in contact with  raw chicken should be thoroughly cleansed with hot water and soap after use.  Packaged chicken stored in the refrigerator should be placed on a plate or  container so that none of the product's fluid drips onto other items creating a  phenomena known as cross-contamination.

headline:   CAMPAIGN TALK;    A WEEKLY WINDOW ON THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS.   
text:   3 days left to register to vote before the May 7 dealine.    36 days left until the June 5 primary election    Reporter shopping: At long last, Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de  Kamp have agreed upon their Los Angeles debate -- May 20 at 4:30 p.m. on KCBS.  Insiders note, however, that negotiations between the two campaign staffs  involved efforts at "reporter shopping." The campaigns weighed offers from  rival stations as to which outlets might insist on including their own  aggressive reporters. The agreement signed by the candidates reserves for  themselves and KCBS to pick the panel. The process left a couple of television  journalists feeling blacklisted and others worrying that they might be  perceived as handpicked stooges if they participate.    KCBS News Director Michael Singer said, "My interest in this situation is to  get what I consider the best qualified reporters in this town."    In a separate development, the campaigns changed channels for their May 13  debate in San Francisco. The new agreement calls for the debate to air on  KRON-TV at 8 p.m. This in place of an afternoon session on KPIX.    Political shadings: Wesley Sanders Jr., the treasurer in Compton, is running a  serious but largely unheralded campaign for state treasurer against a candidate  with name recognition and political connections that Sanders can only dream  about. His opponent in the Democratic primary is Kathleen Brown, daughter and  sister of former governors. "I am not a rich man," Sanders said in a recent  speech, "and although I come from a good family, they are not known across the  state."    Then Sanders, who is black, closed his speech with this: "If you insist on  voting for a Brown for treasurer, vote for me. There is nobody running for  office who is any browner than me."    Assembly update: Lynwood City Councilwoman Evelyn Wells walked away with the  California Democratic Council's endorsement for her bid in the crowded 48th  Assembly District primary. Wells was tough to beat: She serves as the council's  controller.    The endorsement will compete with the official party imprimatur bestowed on  Marguerite Archie-Hudson, another of the four Democrats running for the  nomination. Archie-Hudson also has won the moneyed nods of Speaker Willie Brown  (D-San Francisco) and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who is  giving up her seat to run for Congress.    Meanwhile, candidate Rod Wright has been organizing a swelling church-based  grass-roots effort. And Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell has hired  San Francisco-based campaign consultant Clint Reilly, who was running Dianne  Feinstein's gubernatorial campaign until a celebrated tiff last summer.    Looking ahead: Cathy Calfo, executive director of the California Democratic  Party and right-hand woman to Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr., is on her way out.

headline:   GOLAND GUILTY OF ILLEGAL DONATION TO HELP CRANSTON;    POLITICS: BUSINESSMAN IS ACQUITTED OF FOUR OTHER COUNTS STEMMING FROM  CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE 1986 CAMPAIGN.   
text:   Los Angeles businessman Michael R. Goland, a major pro-Israel contributor to  political campaigns, was convicted in federal court Thursday on one misdemeanor  count of making an illegal donation designed to help the 1986 reelection bid of  Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.).    But at the same time, Goland, 43, was acquitted on four other counts of  conspiracy and making false statements, and the jury deadlocked on a felony  false-statement count.    This was his second trial, the first having ended in a jury deadlock last July.    Sentencing on the one count on which Goland was convicted was set by U.S.  District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew for July 16 in Los Angeles. Goland could receive  up to one year in jail and be fined up to $360,000.    According to court testimony, Goland secretly contributed $120,000 to Edward B.  Vallen, the right-wing American Independent Party's candidate in the 1986 U.S.  Senate race, in order to finance a last-minute advertising campaign by Vallen  designed to draw votes away from Cranston's Republican opponent, Rep. Ed  Zschau.    There was no evidence that Cranston knew of the plan, and the senator was never  implicated in the charges of election law violation brought against Goland.    The Vallen ads financed by Goland said that Vallen was a far better  conservative than Zschau and Republicans ought to vote for him. In the election  returns, Vallen received 109,916 votes, about 5,000 more than the margin by  which Cranston defeated Zschau.    It was only revealed later that Goland was the actual contributor, since the  contributions had been funneled through a large group of other people, some of  them Goland friends and associates, others recruited by third parties, and had  been reported under other names.    An irony in the donations to Vallen is that many of them were initially  reported as coming from orthodox Jews highly supportive of Cranston and Israel.  Vallen, on the other hand, had made statements critical of "Zionists." He  insisted later he had no idea of where his contributions were coming from.    Goland has been a controversial donor since waging a $1.1 million personal  campaign in 1984 to defeat Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), who was viewed as  critical of Israel. He has also spent heavily on other campaigns.    Under election laws, there are no limits on what anyone can spend on an  independent campaign for or against anyone. But there are limits of $2,000 --  $1,000 in both the primary and the general election -- on donations to a  candidate's campaign, and Goland's contributions to Vallen far exceeded those  limits.    The jury Thursday accepted government prosecutors' contentions that Goland had  made an illegal contribution, but it did not accept their contentions that he  had conspired to put together the scheme and then had lied about it.    Goland's attorneys, led by Nathan Lewin of Washington, portrayed him as having  been led astray by inept campaign consultants hired to arrange the matter.    After the verdict, Assistant U.S. Atty. George Newhouse, the chief prosecutor,  said he was "disappointed" at the acquittals, "but we're pleased he was  convicted on the one count."    Newhouse did not directly answer the question of whether the prosecution would  recommend that Goland serve time in jail, saying only that his violation was a  serious one and that the government would recommend "a significant sanction."    Neither Goland nor his attorneys could be reached for comment.    Earlier in the day, one of the jurors at the six-week trial was removed from  the jury for undisclosed reasons. During a hearing before U.S. Dist. Judge  Dickran Tevrizian, Newhouse asked that the dismissed juror, Barry Kuhnki, be  ordered to report to the U.S. marshal for fingerprinting and that a juror's  note that had been given to the judge also be examined for fingerprints and  handwriting.    Tevrizian said the note could be examined but he denied the request that Kuhnki  be fingerprinted.

headline:   AZT CLEARED FOR CHILDREN'S USE, FIRST SUCH AIDS DRUG;    HEALTH: THE FDA'S ACTION IS EXPECTED TO MAKE MORE SUCH ANTIVIRAL MEDICINES  AVAILABLE FOR PEDIATRIC USE.   
text:   The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday formally approved the antiviral  AIDS drug AZT to treat children, making it the first AIDS drug sanctioned as  standard therapy for pediatric use.    The drug was approved for use for patients three months to 12 years old who  have fully developed AIDS or who are infected with the AIDS virus and show  signs of a damaged immune system as measured by laboratory tests. In the latter  group, they need not have overt symptoms of the disease. The drug already has  been approved for adolescents and adults.    "AZT clearly benefits children," said Dr. Dan Hoth, director of the division of  AIDS for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the  government's lead AIDS research agency. "With this approval, it will now be  easier for children to get access to the drug. We think this is an extremely  important milestone in the development of therapeutics for this disease because  it is the first drug for children."    Thursday's action is expected to pave the way for more rapid testing and  approval of additional AIDS drugs for pediatric use. The federal government has  been under increasing pressure to make AIDS treatments and clinical trials of  experimental AIDS drugs more accessible to children, since until recently there  has been nothing available to them. With few exceptions, it has also been  long-standing FDA policy that drugs of any kind cannot be tested on children or  made available to them until they have been studied and approved for use in  adults.    Hoth said that at least three other antiviral AIDS drugs -- DDI, or  dideoxyinosine; DDC, or dideoxycytidine, and CD4 -- are currently being studied  in children.    Of the 128,319 reported cases of AIDS in this country since 1981, there have  been 2,192 cases in children younger than 13, according to the federal Centers  for Disease Control. Of these, 1,182 children have died. There are no reliable  estimates of the number of children infected with the virus, although some  experts have speculated that the figure is as high as 10,000.    AZT, also known as zidovudine, already has been in widespread use in children  since last fall, when the FDA permitted access to the drug for compassionate  reasons while pediatric AZT research was continuing.    At that time, however, Burroughs Wellcome, the manufacturer of AZT, provided  the drug for free. The FDA decision to officially approve the drug for children  now means that Medicaid, private insurance and other third-party payers now  likely will cover its cost.    "FDA's approval of AZT for pediatric use means that the drug is now officially  considered to be a standard therapy for children with AIDS," Health and Human  Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in a statement. "This status should  encourage more insurance providers to reimburse for zidovudine's use in  pediatrics."    The drug -- whose dosage in children is determined by body surface size --  costs an average of $1,750 a year for a child. It is available in a  strawberry-flavored syrup.    "We're very excited, and we're looking now to see what happens with the next  few drugs," said Susan DeLaurentis, co-founder of the Los Angeles-based  Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which raises money for pediatric AIDS research.    "We encourage the drug companies and the FDA to test drugs faster in children  and approve them faster," DeLaurentis added. "It is starting to happen -- and  we hope they will learn from the example of AZT."    The FDA's action came after its antiviral drugs products advisory committee --  a panel of outside experts -- recommended March 30 that the drug be approved  for pediatric use.    The company cautioned, however, that children younger than 15 months of age  undergo more sophisticated confirmatory tests for infection or a viral culture  before beginning AZT therapy. The most commonly performed test for AIDS  infection only indicates the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus and  children of that age whose mothers were infected often still carry antibodies  -- meaning that they may not necessarily be infected.    AZT, which was approved for adult use in 1987, has been studied in formal  trials in more than 200 children since 1986. Once any drug has been approved  for sale, physicians often prescribe it as they see fit, even for unapproved  uses. But in the case of AZT, many health professionals have been reluctant to  give it to children, afraid that its side effects may be more severe in this  patient population.    AZT can cause toxic reactions, which include severe anemia requiring blood  transfusions.    The findings of the pediatric trials have shown that children taking AZT  experience side effects similar to those in adults. The studies have also  demonstrated that children taking AZT experience the same benefits as adults --  that is, it prolongs survival, relieves symptoms, encourages weight gain and  enhances the quality of life.

headline:   PREVIEW / PAPAL VISIT TO MEXICO;    JOHN PAUL II: NO ACCIDENTAL LATIN TOURIST   
text:   On one of Pope John Paul II's frequent visits to the parishes of Rome, an  Italian schoolboy asked him why he traveled so much.    "Because not all the world is Rome," the Pope replied.    John Paul should know. He's been there, from Arctic fjord to South Sea island,  African slums to the sites of concentration camps in Europe. Next week: a  Mexican jail.    What makes the Pope run? He thinks it is, for one thing, a responsibility of  the office. For another, he enjoys it.    On Sunday, John Paul will begin another exhausting foreign pilgrimage, the 47th  of his reign. It will include 10 Mexican cities in eight days, with a stop for  prayers and jet fuel at the Caribbean island of Curacao on the way home.    The Mexico trip, the third abroad for John Paul this year, in effect begins a  second round of travel by a Roman pontiff who has seen more of the world than  all his predecessors combined.    Indeed, it was with his first trip -- to Mexico in January, 1979, a few months  after his election -- that John Paul served notice of a new, on-the-move  papacy. By now, the centuries-old image of an aloof, remote, Rome-bound Pope  are as dated as chain mail and daguerreotypes.    "This is not a Pope who likes walls around him," said Joaquin Navarro, who has  accompanied John Paul on most of his trips, first as correspondent for a  Spanish newspaper and later as papal spokesman. "He will not sit in a  nunciature receiving visitors. He loves personal contact, and he wants five or  six meetings a day -- not only churches, but also slums, factories, jails."    In its way, that first Mexican trip wrote the rules for all that have followed.  Important details have changed and organizational details have been smoothed,  but the practical and theological underpinnings are constants.    This will be John Paul's 10th visit to Latin America, and it is hardly  coincidental that Latin America is home to nearly 40% of the world's 900  million Roman Catholics.    John Paul has made it clear that he sees travel as a major means of fulfilling  his teaching and preaching role as the successor to St. Peter, the first Pope.  For Catholics, he is a visible sign of their faith, just as his presence is a  powerful means of cementing local churches to Rome.    "Quite simply," Navarro said, "the Holy Father believes that people all over  the world have the right to see their Pope, and he has the right to be with his  people, wherever they are."    No aide would ever say it, but they all understand that the Pope enjoys getting  away from the strictures of managerial and ceremonial life at the Vatican.  Here, he is in effect a prisoner in his apostolic palace. If he wants a breath  of fresh air, he walks on the palace roof.    Often John Paul looks wan and tired when trips begin. But at their arduous end,  while those in his retinue stagger from the last accursed bus to the blessed  last plane, he seems perky, refreshed.    John Paul is as hardy as ever, his aides insist, but he is visibly older now,  more stooped, and his travels are much more carefully packaged.    For a then-inexperienced Vatican, the Pope's first visit to Mexico, survivors  say, was a masterpiece of disorganization. He had gone principally to address a  meeting of Latin American bishops wrestling with the implications of the  activist theology of liberation.    But while he was there, at the urging of Mexican bishops and with the consent  of his staff, John Paul tried to do too much. He wound up massively  overprogrammed.    This time, Mexican bishops proposed 19 stops in eight days. Vatican planners,  by now veterans of a to-the-minute schedule, cut it to 10.    The Pope will get his five or six events a day in Mexico, including a meeting  with inmates at a penitentiary in Durango. But he will also get at least eight  hours' rest every night.

headline:   PAY FOR JUDGES   
text:   Your article advocating higher pay for federal judges was rather one-sided and  failed to mention several important points. Perhaps the most important is the  retirement system for federal judges. It is the world's best. He or she can  retire at age 65 on full salary after only 15 years service (Title 18 U.S. Code  S. 371). By comparison, most other federal employees have to put in 40 years of  service to earn the maximum retirement benefit of 80%.    Another item omitted is that several federal judges now serving prison terms  would have been entitled to the 51% salary increase. More significantly, the  Associated Press recently reported that well over 100 federal senior judges (a  senior judge is semi-retired) who have refused to hear any cases since  requesting senior status would have been included in the salary increase along  with their more active colleagues.    Finally, there is a vast difference between what $89,500 will buy in Los  Angeles or Denver than in, say, Boise or Fort Smith. There should be  differences in pay levels among judges in small, medium-sized and large cities.    ROBERT PALMER    Glendale

headline:   GOVERNOR'S REPLY TO EDITORIALS   
text:   In response to my recent letter (March 15), you published three lengthy  editorials which unmasked your definition of vision: higher taxes and more  spending (March 15-17). There is virtually no limit to the big-spending,  high-tax programs you want to impose on the workers and businesses of our  state. These editorials alone call for spending an additional $2.6 billion in  the coming year and you don't make any effort to price them for the out years.    Even so, you conveniently neglected to account for many other spending  increases you have called for in the recent past. Last year alone, The Times  ran at least 70 editorials on the state budget and state programs. Only once  did you call for a reduction in spending, and that was for $50,000.    In all the other editorials, you advocated increased spending, higher taxes, or  both -- yet the costs of many of the proposals were not factored into the  spending totals mentioned in your response. Did you forget, or should we now  consider those editorials "inoperative"?    Your call to slash our prudent reserve by more than a half is not very wise. To  follow your advice would be to put California's fiscal solvency and our  triple-A bond rating in serious jeopardy.    I find your advocacy of closing tax loopholes understandable and self-serving.  You want to apply taxes to lawyers' services, but you failed to mention the  sales tax exemption on the sales of newspapers and advertising revenues  received by newspapers.    Since you have called for tax increases, can we expect that you will begin by  publicly advocating that the sales tax be applied to newspaper sales and  advertising revenues? The Times Mirror Co. can seek the introduction of  legislation to accomplish that in the state Legislature. If you cannot do this,  I think your readers deserve an explanation justifying the continuation of  these exemptions at the same time you advocate taxing lawyers' services.    In your editorials you bemoan the fact that Californians have received what you  have calculated to be $115 billion in tax breaks during the past 10 years. If  the people had followed your advice, they would have paid out $115 billion more  in taxes. I'd like to suggest that you run for governor on that platform and  bring your record of bigger spending and higher taxes to the voters. Then let  the voters decide.    I haven't received your voluntary additional tax payment.     (Editor's note: The governor's March 15 letter noted that Times Mirror Co.,  publisher of the Los Angeles Times, made $332 million in 1988 and stated, "We  will gladly accept your voluntary higher tax payments.")     After publishing 87 column inches of reply editorials, versus my letter of 10  inches, you have now published an 8-page slick reprint and mailed it to  selective persons. You have apparently decided not to "put up or shut up."    P.S. I'm still waiting for your check. Is it in the mail?    GOV. GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN    Sacramento

headline:   PAY FOR JUDGES   
text:   Poor Judge Carrigan! It was all I could do to hold back the tears upon reading  about the terrible life of Carrigan.    First, he had to liquidate many of his financial holdings in order to send his  children "through college and graduate school"; and only the finest private  schools like Notre Dame sufficed. Welcome to the real world, Judge Carrigan!  How about the thousands upon thousands of parents who earn but a small  percentage of Carrigan's salary and yet manage to sacrifice virtually  everything in life in order to help provide some degree of access to the  educational system? Worse yet, how many tens of thousands of willing young  people are forced to forgo a college education due to the severe financial  structures such an undertaking entails? Is it just only recently that Carrigan  has learned that capitalism is inherently unfair; that our society is replete  with a myriad of institutionalized inequities?    Tears also welled up in my eyes upon reading that Carrigan had to sell of "half  interest in the family's Rocky Mountain retreat." I have heard this sad tale of  woe countless times from many of the families in the inner-city in Los Angeles  whose children attend our public schools. Their hearts go out to you, Judge  Carrigan!    And lest we be accused of being sexist, let's hear it for poor Beverly  Carrigan. I mean, sure she could return to a menial and "low-paying occupation"  like "social work." But, alas, being a "bride of the '50s" who likes  "traditional things," it is simply not possible for her to work in order to  supplement the family income. Again, I believe that I can speak for thousands  of working mothers -- many of them single -- when I say that our hearts go out  to you!    One last point, Judge Carrigan. If you think you are not being paid adequately  for your abilities and worth, I suggest that you try teaching for a while in  the public school system for a starting salary in the low $20,000 range.

headline:   COLLEGE BOARD ENDORSEMENTS   
text:   The Los Angeles Community College District is at a turning point. It has a new  chancellor, comparative labor peace and an opportunity to put into effect  far-reaching reforms passed by the Legislature. The decisions made by the  districts' board of trustees, including three members up for election April 11,  will determine how well the nine local community colleges respond to these  changes, in the way they write their budgets as well as in the approaches they  use to help both vocationally oriented students and those who want to go on to  four-year universities.    We are endorsing the following candidates:    Office No. 2 -- Rose Ochi has demonstrated as one of Mayor Tom Bradley's  assistants that she gets things done. She has shown commitment to the community  colleges both by seeking appointment for an earlier vacancy and by serving on  the screening committee that helped select chancellor Donald Phelps. Ochi is a  graduate of Los Angeles City College who transferred to UCLA and later earned  both master's and law degrees. She understands the vital transfer role of the  community colleges and their importance as an entry point for immigrants.    Her opponent, Mary Louise Longoria, has solid education credentials, but we  think Rose Ochi has already proved her leadership and her concern for community  colleges.    Office No. 4 -- Attorney Lindsay Conner, running unopposed for a third term,  has helped the district develop better relations with its teachers' union. He  also has tried to tighten the performance of each campus in recruiting and  retaining students, and deserves a vote of confidence.    Office No. 6 -- Althea R. Baker chairs the counseling department at Mission  College. An attorney as well, she served as chief negotiator for the American  Federation of Teachers local in its bargaining last year with the trustees.  That union is widely perceived as having heavy influence on the college  trustees, but it is a union that seems now to want to work more smoothly with  the college administrators while still standing strongly for better pay and  working conditions. Baker and her colleagues successfully negotiated a new  contract in six weeks instead of the six months of confrontation that had been  the norm. All seven of the current college trustees have endorsed her for this  election.    Baker's principal opponent, Patricia Hollingworth, a teacher at L.A. Trade  Tech, has good credentials, especially in the area of community college  financial management. But Baker has a track record of commitment.    We believe that with the addition of Rose Ochi and Althea Baker and the  reelection of Lindsay Conner, the community college trustees will gain strength  for tackling the changes they face in the coming years.

headline:   WHAT WENT WRONG?   
text:   The 240,000 barrels of crude oil that have spewed from the ruptured hull of the  tanker Exxon Valdez since it ran aground Friday have blackened more than the  pristine waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound.    They also have sullied the credibility of Exxon Co. U.S.A, which owns the  vessel, of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which manages the trans-Alaskan  pipeline and of the state and federal officials whose responsibility it is to  see that these private firms operate in a responsible manner.    This is a harsh judgment, but the facts of this shocking and unnecessary  environmental catastrophe make no other possible. These facts also make it  mandatory that Congress take a rigorous and skeptical look at the Bush  Administration's claim that oil drilling can be expanded into the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge without unacceptable consequences.    While the tardy and inexcusably chaotic cleanup of the worst oil spill ever to  foul American waters proceeds, vexing questions demand answers:     -- Why were the vessel's master, who has a history alcohol abuse, and two  senior officers absent from the bridge when it strayed out of the shipping  channel? Why was an unqualifiedthird mate piloting the ship?     -- Why did Exxon officials fail so miserably in their responsibility to have  an effective contingency cleanup plan in place? Why didn't they have the  requisite equipment on site? Why did the company's officials move so slowly to  contain the spill, thereby squandering the initial two days of good weather  that might have made a quick cleanup feasible?.     -- Why did Alyeska rebuff earlier offers by Valdez city officials to stockpile  cleanup equipment, assuring the local leaders -- falsely, as it now turns out  -- that the oil companies had adequate supplies on hand?     -- Why did the Alaskan state government, which has the primary responsibility  for legal oversight of these matters, fail to exercise it?     -- Why has the Bush Administration been so slow to intervene into what was  from the first day obviously a major environmental crisis?    In fact, the President waited until Tuesday before sending senior aides to the  scene of the spill, and even then seemed to express doubts that the federal  government ought to take a major role in the cleanup. Bush's approach to this  disaster is perplexing.

headline:   LIKE THE EASTSIDE PRISON, IMPACT REPORT IS FLAWED   
text:   When testifying at last July's hearing to consider the environmental-impact  report on the proposed downtown prison, a businessman commented that if one of  his employees produced a report of the same abysmal quality, he would throw it  back at him.    A three-member panel charged with the task of evaluating the  environmental-impact report will begin to hear testimony at another hearing  today. If the certification panel does its job and adheres to the intent of the  California Environmental Quality Act, it will throw the report back to state  Department of Corrections officials and tell them to do it right next time. If  the governor and the Legislature do their jobs, they will tell the Department  of Corrections not to bother with another report and abandon plans for yet  another prison near Los Angeles' Eastside.    Environmental review of the proposed prison, located southeast of Civic Center,  was seriously flawed before it even started. An environmental-impact report  should evaluate impacts from a project, identify how to eliminate the negative  ones and propose alternatives with less drastic environmental consequences.  Thus, the impact report should provide an environmental safety net to protect  residents from harmful effects.    The first two gaping holes in the safety net for the environment and Eastside  residents were carved by the Legislature with the governor's hand firmly on the  knife.    First, the governor and Legislature eliminated the legal mandate to examine  alternative sites. How can the suitability of one location for a prison be  fairly judged if it cannot be compared to others?    In a second assault on the review process, the Legislature fashioned another  unfair environmental loophole solely for the proposed downtown prison. This  allowed the state to purchase the downtown land before the prison plan was  reviewed for environmental effects. But a different standard was applied for  the other prison authorized by the Legislature. The land for that proposed  prison, located in Lancaster, would not be purchased until after environmental  studies are completed.    This difference represents a total perversion of environmental review. Either  the state so flagrantly disregarded the rights of Eastside residents that it  was willing to subject them to another jail despite the environmental  consequences, or the state threw fiscal responsibility out the window by  spending approximately $30 million on a downtown site it may never use. To make  matters worse, the city attorney estimates that it would cost approximately $60  million more to locate a prison downtown than at a comparable rural site.    The final unweaving of the environmental safety net occurred in the  environmental-impact report itself. Instead of fairly addressing the concerns  raised by residents, the report serves to rationalize the department's  predetermined decision to build a prison on the Eastside. It relies upon  speculation, irrelevant studies and unconvincing analysis to defend the plan  for the first California prison ever located in the middle of a densely  populated urban environment.    For years, residents opposed this prison because they are concerned about the  safety of their children, the future of their families and the character of  their community. It seems unfathomable that an environmental-impact report  could conclude that placement of a prison in a community that already houses  75% of the inmates in Los Angeles County would not affect the environment.  Merlin the Magician could not perform this sleight of hand.    Just consider crime and public safety. The environmental-impact report, in  effect, says, "Don't worry -- crime won't increase." This speculative  conclusion is derived from studies of rural prisons that have perimeter  security and remote locations irrelevant to the discussion of a downtown site.  And the rural sites don't suffer from the severe urban gang and crime problems  that the downtown location has. Further, the report irresponsibly dismissed the  Los Angeles Police Department's concern that gang activity may increase in  communities surrounding the prison.    But perhaps the most blatantly callous conclusion contained in the report is  the suggestion that if an escape occurs and the escapee commits another crime,  this should not be interpreted as having a significant impact on the  environment. Has the Department of Corrections considered the impact it will  have on the victim? The victim's family? The community?    The 870,000 residents who live within five miles of the proposed prison deserve  enforcement of the laws enacted to safeguard their environment. The parents of  the 45,000 children who attend the 36 schools located within three miles of the  planned lockup deserve the same environmental protections parents receive in  more affluent communities. How can the Department of Corrections'  environmental-impact report find no cause for concern regarding the abundance  of schools surrounding the prison site? The Department of Corrections has  produced a report better termed an Environmental Indifference Report.    Fortunately, this pattern can stop. The certification panel can alter the  course by rejecting the report. Then it's up to the Department of Corrections  to pull the plug on this wasteful spending of public funds, search for a more  appropriate prison site, and get on with the crucial prison expansion program.

headline:   IF YOU DANCE WITH KADAFI ON CHEMICAL ARMS, KISS THE AMERICAN MARKET GOODBY   
text:   Every day, step by step, Libya's lunatic leader, Moammar Kadafi, comes closer  and closer to producing chemical weapons and perfecting the means to deliver  them over long distances. If he gets there -- and he might well, not in years  but in months -- we've got a new and deadly ball game in the Middle East.    And Kadafi is not the only problem. Iraq not only has but has used chemical  weapons in its war with Iran. Iran and Syria are hellbent on developing their  own chemical weapons capability. And other Third World nations are moving in  the same direction.    The evil genie is already out of the bottle. There may still be time to get him  back in there, but only if we act now.    We've got the right overall policy. Our aim is to eliminate chemical weapons  entirely. In fact, we've been reducing our own stockpiles of chemical weapons  for years. The Soviets have now said they will start destroying theirs, too. I  hope so. But let's make sure this offer is not just a sham, designed to get us  to halt production of the newer, safer binary chemical weapons that we have  developed to help offset the massive Soviet stockpiles and production lines. We  have to make sure the world -- allies and adversaries alike -- understand this  bottom line: The United States is prepared to agree to the destruction of all  of our chemical weapons when the Soviets are ready to sign a binding,  worldwide, verifiable agreement to ban all such weapons.    But even as we try to negotiate this global ban, more and more nations seek to  acquire chemical weapons. We're trying to stop them by pushing the adoption of  a major international agreement to control the export of technology and  equipment. We made some progress on that score recently at the Paris conference  on chemical weapons. That must remain a top priority. But we also have to face  facts: We're not going to have a good agreement for many months, perhaps years.    We can't just sit back and wait for that day. We have to act now, with every  bit of leverage we have. If Kadafi takes that last step and starts producing  chemical weapons, we should make clear our determination to do whatever is  necessary to deny him the opportunity to use his deadly new toys.    And we have to do one other thing. According to many reports, Japanese and West  European firms, in a sickening pursuit of the almighty dollar, or yen, or  Deutsche mark, are helping Kadafi and his crowd produce chemical weapons or  develop the means to deliver them. No firm that knowingly engages in that kind  of reckless activity deserves the right to profit from the American market.  That's why Sens. Jake Garn, John Heinz and others from both parties have joined  me in introducing legislation that states this sound and simple proposition: If  you deal with the likes of Kadafi on chemical weapons, you can kiss the  American market goodby.    Specifically, the bill requires the President to investigate and report on any  firms engaged in such activity, and then bans all such firms from selling their  products in America or contracting with our government anywhere in the world  for many years.    Do we have the right to take such action? You bet we do. Our security  interests, our allies and friends, the lives of American citizens, they're all  at stake.    Do we need to take such action? We have to. If we don't, who will?    And finally, do we need to act now? We had better. Because one of these  tomorrows, it may be too late.

headline:   NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: RESEARCHERS ASSAIL LACK OF CALCIUM IN WOMEN'S DIETS   
text:   The scientific community, including the National Research Council (NRC) and  U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, has a bone to pick with women who regularly  fail to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance of 800 milligrams of calcium or  who do so by swallowing calcium tablets in lieu of low-fat foods. There is  concern that the importance of continuously replenishing the body's supply of  the mineral through dietary sources has been under-evaluated and overshadowed  by the fear of fat in the diet.    A report released earlier this month by the NRC stressed the need for young and  adolescent women to increase their intake of dietary calcium. The Surgeon  General's Report on Nutrition and Health, published last year, also addressed  this topic.    "Calcium is an essential nutrient," the NRC report stated. "It is necessary for  adequate growth and skeletal development. Certain segments of the population,  especially women and adolescents, need to make careful food choices to obtain  adequate calcium from the food supply. The committee recommends that  consumption of low- and nonfat dairy products and dark green vegetables, which  are rich sources of calcium, can assist in maintaining calcium intake at  approximately the RDA levels."    Furthermore, the report continues, "the potential benefits of calcium intake  above the RDAs to prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well-documented  and do not justify the use of calcium supplements."      Intake Drops    Figures taken from the USDA's nationwide food consumption survey found that in  1985 women between the ages of 19 and 34 managed to achieve only about 80% of  the RDA of calcium from food sources. Calcium intake for women in the 35- to  50-year-old age range, dropped to as low as 68% of the RDA -- which is itself  under scrutiny for being too low.    And since 1984, when a National Institutes of Health panel concluded that  post-menopausal women needed twice the RDA of calcium and pre-menopausal women  needed 1 1/2 times the RDA, supplement sales have "skyrocketed," USDA reports.    To improve consumer intake of dietary calcium, researchers have launched a  triple attack. They are re-emphasizing the importance of building bone during  the formative years, noting that older women consuming less than half the  calcium needed over a prolonged period can suffer a loss of nearly 5% of spinal  bone per year. They are stressing that the female hormone estrogen has a  significant role in bone loss. And they are citing the negative effects of  meeting the recommended goal through supplementation.      Best Insurance    Research data indicates that taking extra calcium after menopause probably  doesn't slow bone loss and building additional bone during youth -- when the  soft tissue inside the bones is in a continuous state of development -- is the  best insurance against osteoporosis later in life.    This was underscored most recently when studies of high calcium intake in older  rats were completed. The research was directed by Dr. James C. Smith, head of  the Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Laboratory at Beltsville, Md., part of the  government's Agricultural Research Service.    "I think there's a body of evidence that the best way is to build up the bones  before menopause," Smith said in an interview, adding, "but I haven't worked  with women."    His investigation was conducted at the Beltsville lab by University of Maryland  graduate students under the direction of Joseph H. Soares, nutrition professor.    It is scientific fact that the body's ability to absorb calcium is variable  with age. During typical periods of growth, intestinal absorption of calcium  increases, with infants and children absorbing up to 60% of the calcium they  ingest. Pregnant women use about 50% and other adults only retain about 30%.  Calcium available from supplements is often even less, depending upon the  binders used in the product, which can hold onto the calcium and prevent the  body from using it. The ability of an individual's stomach acid to dissolve the  supplements also is associated with malabsorption.    And there are other factors: bone loss accelerates naturally after age 35 and  becomes more and more difficult to retard with age; after menopause a steady  decline of estrogen -- an important component in bone mineralization -- is  observed, and the process of bone development appears to slow down as an animal  ages, making the bones solid, more brittle and thus less efficient at storing  calcium.    (Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.  But it is used for various bodily functions. These include: regulating cell and  nerve functions, maintaining normal blood pressure, muscle contraction  capabilities including maintaining heartbeat, clotting of blood and preserving  the material that holds cells together.)    "The high calcium intake did not affect bone dynamics in the aged female rats  but increased bone formation in the young rats," said Rashmi Sinha, the  nutritionist who conducted the study. "Just taking a lot of calcium later in  life, without replacing the female hormones, is not going to increase bone  formation as it does earlier in life."      Risk of Cancer    But estrogen replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk for  endometrial cancer and requires ongoing medical follow-up, according to Dr.  Bess Dawson Hughes, director of the Calcium and Bone Research Laboratory at the  USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. She is  currently conducting a five-year study of 360 post-menopausal women to  determine the benefit of taking calcium, how much is necessary to minimize bone  loss and the potential hazards associated with calcium supplementation.  Preliminary results indicate that with extremely low intakes of calcium --  below the current U.S. intake level of 600 milligrams -- there is some benefit,  even without estrogen replacement therapy.    "The study suggests that postmenopausal women most likely to benefit from  increased calcium are those who consume less than 400 milligrams a day, the  equivalent of 1 1/3 glasses of milk," she said.    "If our research shows calcium can retard bone loss in some women regardless of  estrogen, that's good news, because estrogen replacement therapy isn't for  everybody."    Osteoporosis is the gradual loss of bone mineral from the skeleton, occuring in  millions of American women (and some men), and it "goes on for many, many  years," she said. It starts as early as age 20 and continues at a rate of 1% a  year in women throughout their lives. The rate in men is about .25% per year.    This deterioration typically starts out in the spine, and manifests itself as a  compression fracture. It is a very common disorder, according to Dawson Hughes,  who estimated that one out of every four white women over the age of 60 will be  afflicted with the ailment. There are a number of factors that increase risk.    Since women have less bone to start with and tend to lose it at a greater rate  from their spines, being a female is the primary factor, said Dawson Hughes.  Being either Asian or Caucasian is another. Family history has a role, as does  a lifetime of low calcium intake. Early menopause, low body weight, sedentary  life style, bearing no children, alcohol abuse, high sodium intake, cigarette  smoking, high caffeine intake, high protein intake and high phosphorus intake  are others.    One conclusion that can be drawn is that younger women, who typically are  deficient in calcium as well as iron, should adjust their diets to include at  least three servings of dairy products and other calcium-rich foods per day,  instead of relying on supplements.    According to the National Dairy Board, a serving size is: 1 cup milk, 8 ounces  yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces natural cheese or 2 ounces processed cheese.    Drinking nonfat or low-fat milk is the most efficient way to accomplish this.  One (8-ounce) serving of fluid nonfat milk provides about 90 calories, less  than a gram of fat and 300 milligrams of calcium. The same size serving of 1%  low-fat milk offers 102 calories, 3 grams fat and 300 milligrams calcium.  One-cup of whole milk provides the most calories and fat for its calcium  benefit -- 150 calories, 8 grams fat and 291 grams calcium -- while 2% low fat  has just slightly less calories and fat: 121 and 5 grams fat for its 297 grams  calcium.      Meeting Dairy Requirement    If drinking milk is not an option, here are some dairy and non-dairy foods  which in combination can help meet the daily requirement: 1 ounce of low-fat  cheese, such as part-skim mozzarella adds 200 milligrams calcium; 1 cup low-fat  cottage cheese offers about 140 milligrams calcium, 1 cup low-fat fruit-added  yogurt, 345; 3 ounces canned salmon with bones, 180, and 3 ounces sardines, 300  milligrams.    Dark leafy vegetables, in general, are rich in calcium, but some, such as kale,  broccoli and beet greens, are the best absorbed. Other types, such as spinach  and turnip greens, contain a naturally occuring calcium binder, which tends to  hold on to the calcium.    Some processed foods, because of fortification or a calcium-salt additive used  in the manufacturing process, are also good sources of dietary calcium. These  include tofu (bean curd), canned tomatoes, stone-ground or self-rising flour  and blackstrap molasses.    In addition to increasing low-fat sources of calcium in the diet, women are  encouraged to develop a regular routine of exercise. This helps maintain bone  mass and stimulates new bone formation. Although Dawson Hughes admits that the  exact role of exercise in the maintenance of bone mass remains a little  unclear, it appears that it is "very, very important."    She said it apparently increased bone density in a studied population  representing a cross section of women of all ages -- particularly those who  previously were extremely sedentary.    In another study, women who exercised for one hour, three times a week  increased their bone mineral content by 1% over a one-year period. Those, who  did not decreased their bone mineral content by the same amount.    "If you took the balance on a daily basis," she explained, "the exercisers were  gaining 42 milligrams of calcium for their bodies. You have about 100,000  milligrams in your body, so that doesn't sound like much. But every day, day  in, day out, that adds up . . . . It's a very effective means of impact on your  bones."    To help in designing a calcium-conscious life style, consider some of the  following recipes, which are based upon a popular Oriental cooking ingredient  and non-dairy substitute, bean curd.

headline:   COOK IT LIGHT: SLIMMING DOWN A FETTUCCINE DISH   
text:   DEAR JEANNE: This recipe appeared in a newspaper recently. It's yummy, and we  love it, but a quart of heavy cream? Can you help, please?     -- LIZ DOERING, Minneapolis, Minn.      TRADEWINDS CHICKEN FETTUCCINE    2 pounds fettuccine noodles    4 cups whipping cream    1 1/2 tablespoons chopped garlic    2 tablespoons powdered chicken base    1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper    2 cups freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese    4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed    1 ounce butter or margarine    Freshly chopped parsley    Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and cool.    Reduce cream by 1/4 in saucepan over low heat. While reducing, add garlic,  powdered chicken base and white pepper, stirring occasionally. When reduced,  add cheese slowly while whipping with wire whisk until sauce has consistency of  shake or malt.    Saute chicken meat in butter or margarine in large non-stick saute pan over  high heat. Stir and break up pieces. When outside of chicken is cooked, add  sauce, reduce heat to medium and add noodles. Stir 5 to 10 minutes or until  hot, being careful not to scorch.    Garnish with parsley. Makes 4 to 6 servings.    DEAR LIZ: I agree, a quart of heavy cream is excessive -- and the fat and  cholesterol can be dangerous. There are some other problems with this recipe,  however. When I made it I realized that it yields about 16 cups, which means  that if you are feeding six people, each one would have to eat almost three  cups.    I think a more realistic number of servings for this recipe would be 10 to 12.  You will notice the difference this makes in the bottom-line figures when you  compare the original recipe as figured for six servings and the revised figured  for 12 servings.    Another change you might want to make is to cut the recipe in half unless you  are planning to serve it for company. You might also find that you can make the  recipe without the noodles, then serve it as a sauce over pasta and keep the  unused portion of sauce in the freezer.    I substituted low-fat milk for the cream and eliminated the chicken base  altogether since it contains sodium and MSG. I also reduced the amount of  cheese called for, to help lower the calories and fat, as well as sodium. This  revision will not taste as "fatty" as the original, but the garlic and cheese  flavors will be more predominant.      JEANNE'S CHICKEN FETTUCCINE    2 pounds fettuccine noodles    2 1/2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine    1/2 cup unbleached flour    2 cups chicken stock    1 1/4 cups low-fat milk    5 garlic cloves, chopped    1/2 teaspoon salt    1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper    6 ounces freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese    1 pound boned and skinned chicken breast halves, cubed    Chopped parsley    Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and cool.    Melt margarine in saucepan. Add flour and stir over medium heat 1 minute. Do  not brown. Add chicken stock, low-fat milk and garlic. Using wire whisk, stir  over medium heat until mixture comes to boil.    Add salt and white pepper and continue to cook 1 minute more. Slowly add grated  cheese to sauce, whipping with wire whisk until sauce has consistency of shake  or malt.    Saute chicken meat in large non-stick skillet over high heat. Stir and break up  pieces. When outside of chicken is cooked, drain water from skillet and add  sauce. Reduce to medium heat and add noodles. Stir 5 to 10 minutes or until  hot, being careful not to scorch.    Garnish with parsley. Makes 12 servings.

headline:   LIVER AND ONIONS   
text:   The secret of this recipe for classic Liver and Onions is the long, slow  cooking.    Cook the onions at least 20 minutes, during which time they will develop a rich  brown color and release their natural sweet taste.    Prepare the liver while the onions are cooking by cutting it into thin, even  strips. By slicing the liver in this fashion you enable it to cook thoroughly  in only about 3 minutes. The short cooking time gives the liver a velvety  texture and helps it achieve the maximum flavor. Add a drop of vinegar or lemon  juice at the end of the cooking time to further enhance the flavor.    Peel and quarter 2 large onions and slice thinly. In large skillet heat 2  tablespoons oil, then add onions and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Move onions to edge of pan, add 2 tablespoons oil and heat until hot.    Add 1 pound calf's liver, cut into strips, and cook, stirring constantly, about  3 minutes or until done. Sprinkle juice of 1 lemon over liver, then stir with  onions. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons chopped parsley. Makes 4 servings.

headline:   THE KITCHEN CABINET: A GOOD PLACE TO COOK UP WEDDING GIFT IDEAS   
text:   In the market for a wedding present? Try something for the couple's kitchen,  which is always a great source for potential gift ideas. Varying in price  range, the item could be anywhere from a nifty culinary gadget such as a small  lemon reamer to a major appliance -- an upscale noise-free dishwasher, for  instance.    The duplication problem of ending up with a bridal present that stands the  chance of becoming a candidate for store return or exchange may be avoided by  providing an unusual but useful gift. Kitchen Whiz from Seiko Instruments is a  brand new product that fits the needs of experienced and novel cooks,  particularly dieters and those who adapt recipes from publications.      More Than a Calculator    Nicely packaged, Kitchen Whiz ($59.95) is a recipe conversion calculator and  more. The first of its kind, the invention was based on an original design by  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My first impression of this  electronic device was that it seemed complicated to operate. But once  directions were read (they were rather easy to comprehend by the way), the  operation was surprisingly simple. The only requirement is to remember the  techniques, which become easier through frequent use; otherwise it's just as  easy to go over directions again.    With the touch of a few buttons, you can program and convert to the desired  number of servings from a larger or smaller recipe. Each ingredient can be  reduced or increased proportionally with a simple formula. Other applications  of the tool include controlling meal portions (which is terrific for dieters),  converting recipes from metric to English weights and measures, computing  cooking times for roasts and converting temperatures.    The Kitchen Whiz also acts as a food preparation timer with a beep, a clock, a  calendar and to say the least, a mathematical calculator. Unlike other  calculators, the numerical figures and words in the washable key pad are easy  to read and sensitive to the touch. Equally legible is the display screen with  8-digit, 12-character dot matrix. The computer measures 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 1 1/2  and is fitted with a special bar on the back for propping on a countertop or  hanging on the wall. The Kitchen Whiz operates on two size AA batteries and  comes with a full one-year warranty. For more information on the product, call  Seiko Instruments' toll-free number: (800) 837-4568.    Not an uncommon bridal gift is a set of cookware. For everyday cooking,  particularly by those interested in low-fat dishes, nonstick cookware has fared  very well in the past several years. Among the lines that have been successful  is T-Fal. Attractive, lightweight and good heat conductors with its aluminum  base, T-Fal nonstick cookware sets feature porcelain enameled pans in a variety  of colors with heat resistant handles. The custom-fitted stainless steel covers  are equipped with adjustable safety steam-vented cover knobs to help prevent  boil-overs.    The latest from this French-based company is the Classic Series ($70 for an  eight-piece set), featuring an elegant pewter gray and etched trim look. The  outside has a special nonstick coating too for even quicker cleanups.      Gift of Cookware    Introduced last fall is the Versailles line ($90 for an eight-piece set) in the  prettiest, brightest cobalt blue. Each piece features "Ultrabase," an exclusive  formulation from T-Fal that consists of three exterior layers: an outside  porcelain enamel layer, a second thermic layer for heat distribution and a  close contact layer for perfect contact on heat sources such as the newer  ceramic cooktops. The interior features a nonstick surface that has improved  resistance to scratches, abrasions and staining.    Also available are the Durabase Royale Black ($70 for eight pieces), with  high-tech black porcelain and reinforced bottom surfaces, and the premiere  Signature collection ($80 for eight pieces). The latter is Euro-designed in  handsome dove gray with white accent. Each T-Fal cookware set is available in  colorful gift packaging. Open stock pieces are available and different series  may also include a Dutch oven, chicken fryer, griddle, an oblong roaster or a  wok.      Handmade Block Sets    If you admire Corian countertops, you easily could fall for a Corian and Oak  Knife Block Set ($519) from Kitchen Kitchen in Rancho Mirage. This beautiful  block set includes a complete set of J. A. Henckels white Professional Series  knives and sharpening steel plus a pair of Henckels shears. Phil Carter, owner  of this desert specialty shop, designed the set and had them handmade by a  Corian craftsman. He says: "The white-handled knives look out of place in an  ordinary oak block, but absolutely come alive in the Corian block. The  black-handled ones are also very attractive in it, especially when the kitchen  has black appliances." After designing the block, Carter has gotten positive  responses from decorators as well as from people who have the Corian tops in  their kitchens.    The block itself ($195) is usually available in Corian white with oak striping  but can be specially ordered in a different Corian finish. For more information  call (619) 568-0620.     The Seiko Instruments Kitchen Whiz will soon be available at Home Express,  Arrowhead Business Machines, Buffum's, Federated, The Sharper Image and Long's  Drugs.     The T-Fal cookware sets are available at Robinson's and May Co and some  specialty gourmet shops.     The Corian and Oak Knife Block Set is available at Kitchen Kitchen (Rancho  Mirage).

headline:   HINTS FROM HELOISE: SOME SHORTCUTS TO EASY CLEANUP WHEN YOU'RE FLOURING A  CHICKEN   
text:   DEAR HELOISE: One of my least favorite chores is trying to get a plate clean  after using it when flouring chicken. After dipping the chicken in either milk  or egg batter and then rubbing it in flour, the plate is a terrible mess. I  scrub and scrub and eventually it comes clean.    Now before I start cooking, I cover the plate with a piece of plastic wrap and  then put the flour on it. This way I simply roll the flour and everything up  and throw it away. This sure made my meal preparation much easier.     -- BETSY C., Anniston, Ala.    DEAR BETSY: I use a paper plate and toss the whole mess away.    DEAR HELOISE: When I have leftovers, I try to find clever ways of using them.  My family hates the idea of eating leftovers, so when I succeed in disguising  them they never even know, and mealtime is more pleasant for all of us.    When I have a small amount of fruit left over, I add it to the batter of either  pancakes or waffles, whichever I prepare for breakfast. Pancakes and waffles  are now a favorite in this household.     -- GLORIA C. Phoenix, Ariz.    DEAR HELOISE: I have some burned-on food on a stainless steel pot. Is there an  easy method without scrubbing endlessly? I can't seem to find anything that  works well.     -- A READER, Los Angeles    DEAR READER: You are right, that burned-on food can be a devil to remove. The  following method should only be used on stainless steel and not on aluminum  cookware.    Preheat the stainless steel pot until it is slightly warm and place it on a  heavy brown paper bag to protect your counter. Generously spray the pot with  some oven cleaner. Allow it to set for five to 10 minutes and then rinse off  the pot.    If the food has been on the pots for a long time or if it is a heavy  concentration, it may take several applications and some scrubbing. Eventually  most of the burned food will be removed. The pan should be washed after all the  oven cleaner is rinsed off. Wash it well with hot soapy water and allow it to  dry.     -- HELOISE    DEAR HELOISE: Here's a great tip on saving bottled salad oil from pouring out  all over my vegetables.    When I remove the cap from the bottle of oil, rather than removing the seal, I  cut a slit in it. It pours out slowly so I can measure it, without spilling it  everywhere. Sure saves on the calories, and no more soggy salad.     -- JOAN D., Oklahoma City, Okla.    DEAR HELOISE: It seems I am forever dieting and when dieting it is important to  drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day. This was always difficult for me. I  mean, who actually likes to drink that much water? Certainly not me.    So, to try to help I bought my very own special glass. It is very attractive  and I use it all the time. Whenever it is empty, I refill it. It serves as a  constant reminder of how great I'm going to look.     -- KAY S., Harrisburg, Pa.    DEAR KAY: I use a beautiful crystal goblet. It does make a difference.     -- HELOISE      DEAR HELOISE: How can I clean a solid copper kettle? I answered my door and  when I returned, I found it black from being on the stove burner.     -- NINA, Metairie, La.    DEAR NINA: Of course, you can use a good commercial cleaner or you could try  our home-style remedy. Try pouring some white vinegar on a sponge along with a  sprinkle of salt and rub the kettle. The black should come off. If the kettle  is really black, you may need to do several applications. Good luck.     -- HELOISE    DEAR HELOISE: This past summer I was invited to a picnic and was told to bring  some soda pop. I stopped by a corner convenience store and bought four cold  six-packs of soda to put in my two small coolers.    When I saw the price of bags of ice, knowing the soda would be gulped down  quickly when I got to the picnic, I bought four cans of frozen orange juice and  put them in my coolers with the soda. The soda stayed cold until it was  consumed.    I took the cans of orange juice home, mixed them and drank it during the next  week.     -- MIKE, Houston    DEAR HELOISE: For years I have hassled with the 13-gallon trash bags I put in  my wastebasket. After emptying the trash, I always opened the new plastic bag  and shook air into it, spread it at the bottom and hoped it covered the bottom  and corners of the basket.    Well, it didn't work. Almost every time I threw something in the new bag, the  top part that I had carefully folded over the top edge would fall down inside  the basket.    I thought that a large rubber band (or an elastic cord that has a diameter  about the size of a pencil) around the top of the basket would keep the bag in  place. Since I didn't have either of those, I tried plain old clothespins. My  wastebasket is round and I used three clothespins spaced around the top edge.  They work well and do not interfere with me tossing trash in it.     -- MARSHAL, Waco, Tex.    DEAR HELOISE: I am a short person and I found it hard to clean a chest freezer,  but I finally discovered the trick to make it easy. After the freezer  defrosted, I got a sponge mop and mopped up the bottom of the chest. The sponge  takes up most of the water and is easy to wring out. No more bending over the  side to reach the bottom, no more wet hands and no more backaches.     -- ELAINE, Northfield, N.H.    DEAR HELOISE: My family loves frozen waffles. However, it seems that when I  would get them to the table they would be cold.    So, to alleviate this problem I now heat the syrup. I place the syrup in a pan  of hot water for about 10 minutes. Now when the waffles are on the table we  pour the hot syrup over them.    It is delicious.     -- NANCY, San Diego    DEAR HELOISE: My family loves mushrooms. How can I get them sliced so the  slices will be uniform? They look so much more appetizing when they are neatly  cut and I know there has to be an easy way to do this.     -- PEGGY, Boise, Ida.    DEAR PEGGY: You are right! There is a simple and easy method to slice them --  use an egg slicer! The slices come out evenly in just the flick of your wrist.    DEAR HELOISE: I remember reading in your column some time back several  different uses for chopsticks.    At that time I thought they were good ideas and now I can't seem to locate the  clipping. Would you please reprint this information for me.     -- A READER, Orangeburg, S.C.    DEAR READER: Chopsticks are quite handy to have in the kitchen.    They are especially good for mixing eggs. They are also handy when mixing  orange juice. You can "chop" at the frozen clump and it breaks apart much  easier.    I also find them helpful when measuring out ingredients. They are great for  leveling off just about anything.    One favorite is to use one to break up clumps of dirt in the ivy sitting in the  kitchen window.

headline:   DISEASES OF DIETARY EXCESS;    AMERICANS EATING THEMSELVES TO DEATH   
text:   The U.S. surgeon general's report on nutrition and health, released several  months ago, offered some good and some bad news.    Our abundant food supply has virtually eliminated such deficiency diseases as  rickets, scurvy, pellagra, beriberi, xerophthalmia and goiter.    But we are eating ourselves to death.    Diseases of dietary excess and imbalance now rank among the leading causes of  illness and death in the United States.    Diet plays a part in five of our top 10 causes of death -- coronary heart  disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. In addition,  diet also may contribute to other problems such as high blood pressure,  obesity, dental disease, osteoporosis and gastrointestinal disorders such as  diverticular disease.    Some of the end costs of diet-related diseases were detailed in the surgeon  general's report, along with recommendations for prevention. These included:      First Line of Intervention    Coronary heart disease. More than 1.25 million heart attacks occur each year,  and more than 500,000 people die as a result. In 1985, illnesses and deaths  from coronary heart disease cost Americans an estimated $49 billion in direct  health care expenditures and lost productivity.    The report's recommendation: "For individuals whose high total and LDL  cholesterol levels warrant treatment, the first line of intervention is diet  therapy."    High blood pressure, or hypertension. This is a major risk factor for both  heart disease and stroke. Almost 58 million people in the United States have  hypertension, including 39 million younger than 65. About 50,000 Americans a  year suffer a stroke, resulting in nearly 150,000 deaths in 1987 and long-term  disability for many others. About 2 million living Americans suffer from  stroke-related disabilities, at an estimated annual cost of more than $11  billion.    Recommendation: People need to be informed of the likely benefit of dietary  practices such as achieving and maintaining desirable body weight, moderating  sodium and alcohol intake and moderating fat, especially saturated fat.    Cancer. The costs of cancer for 1985 have been estimated to be $22 billion for  direct health care costs, $9 billion in lost productivity due to treatment or  disability and $41 billion in lost productivity due to premature death.      Reduce Elevated Risk    Recommendation: People at high risk for diet-related cancers because of family  history, obesity or excessive alcohol intake should receive counseling from  qualified health professionals to design approaches that could reduce their  elevated risk for cancer.    Diabetes. In 1985, diabetes was estimated to cost $13.8 billion a year. In  addition to the nearly 38,000 deaths attributed directly to diabetes, 95,000  deaths a year result from cardiac and kidney complications.    Recommendation: Again, more information and counseling on diet.    And the list goes on.    In the past, we all just took eating for granted. But with escalating health  care costs, we need to take another look at the food choices we make every day.    Choosing an extra baked potato instead of a second serving of meat could be one  step toward saving yourself the cost of bypass surgery.

headline:   A REASON TO AVOID NICOTINE CHEWING GUM   
text:   Question: I've been using nicotine chewing gum in a program to get me to stop  smoking. Can I continue to use it if I become pregnant?    Answer: Nicotine chewing gum should not be used during a pregnancy.    Q: I've been making a point of using skim milk and cottage cheese instead of  whole milk and solid cheeses because I was told that I would get less fat in my  diet that way. But I'd like to know what low-fat really means. If I don't use  skim milk and cottage cheese, how much fat do these other dairy products have  in them? Does it really make a difference?    A: Butter is about 100% fat, and many cheeses are at least 70% fat. As for  whole milk, one-half of its calories come from fat.    Q: My sister-in-law has cancer, and she's been accepted for a clinical trial. I  know that it involves some form of treatment, but I'm not sure what a clinical  trial actually is. Are there any risks to it? I would appreciate an  explanation.    A: Clinical trials usually are designed to evaluate a new form of treatment.  New treatments may appear to be safe and effective when tested in the  laboratory, but no one can be certain of this until it is used on humans. The  clinical trial helps determine this.    All treatments, both new and old, involve both risks and benefits; with a new  treatment, however, there may be risks that could not have been foreseen. On  the other hand, a clinical trial can provide patients with the finest in  available medical care and with a form of treatment that may be superior to  anything else they had been receiving.

text:   The U.S. Information Agency has decided not to appeal a pivotal court ruling  that found the agency violated constitutional guarantees of free speech by  denying export certificates to a group of documentary films that espoused  liberal views opposed by the Reagan administration. The much-publicized 1986  case pitted seven film makers, whose on-screen topics range from Nicaragua  under the Sandinistas to the perils of nuclear energy, against the USIA and its  former director, Charles Z. Wick. The agency refused to certify the films for  export, and the film makers charged that the agency was attempting to censor  the films' contents. The agency's criteria for determining suitability for  export certification were challenged in Los Angeles federal court and found  unconstitutional. That ruling was appealed and upheld in higher courts. The  agency this week chose not to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. (A  related legal matter over a second set of USIA guidelines is still pending,  however.) ALEENE MacMINN

headline:   JAZZ REVIEWS ;    HOLLOWAY/SHELDON TEAM AT GRAND AVENUE BAR   
text:   Going to hear a quintet fronted by saxophonist Red Holloway and trumpeter Jack  Sheldon is a little like settling down to watch a rerun of a favorite  television show, or reading for the umpteenth time a favorite novel or poem.  While you might be a bit fuzzy on the details, you know the gist of the whole  thing and are eager to be impressed again by the quality.    At the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar on Tuesday evening, Holloway and  Sheldon -- two familiar hands on the jazz scene -- offered nothing startling  over the course of two sets, but impressed nonetheless with the quality of  their art.    Holloway, an energetic saxophonist mired happily in the mainstream, is beyond  having to display the screeching high end of his instrument's range -- or its  belching bottom -- to impress. Rather, he stays firmly within the natural range  and allows his ideas to gush forth with a mature musicality.    Sheldon, his partner in this venture, was likewise able to impress with  bell-clear notes that rang true as he explored the vagaries of the written song  and delivered a seemingly non-stop series of improvised gems.    "Green Dolphin Street" is a song so overplayed that it belongs in permanent  cold storage. But this group, spurred by drummer Paul Humphrey and anchored by  bassist Richard Reid, found new life. New life was also found in the familiar  "Don't Get Around Much Any More" and "Just Friends," two tunes that featured  Sheldon's musky, yet effective vocals. Again, working from the time-honored  tradition of improvisation, the quintet was able to make each of the songs  bright and fresh.    Though a bawdy little blues from Holloway and a rollicking rendition of Charlie  Parker's "Billie's Bounce" were highlights, it was the ballad inclusions that  were particularly special. Holloway's readings of "You Don't Know What Love Is"  and "Here's That Rainy Day" were simply beautiful, with Sheldon accenting his  co-leader's ideas with sensitivity and style. Pianist Dwight Dickerson was  accomplished in both accompanying and soloing roles.    For those who appreciate old wine in new bottles, the Holloway/Sheldon Quintet  is a worthy find.A.

headline:   GEORGE O 'KEEFFE SHOW OPENS AT COUNTY ART MUSEUM   
text:   Bleached cattle bones bake in the white-hot sun, lush poppies unfurl rich red  petals, vivid abstractions reek with erotic overtones: Georgia O'Keeffe's art  has come to town.    Winding up a blockbuster five-city tour, "Georgia O'Keeffe: 1887-1986" opens  today at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Critical assessments of the  exhibit have varied, but museum officials who have hosted the revered American  modernist's show, already seen by more than 1.3 million people, call it  immensely popular. In Dallas, it broke attendance records.    Organized in late 1987 by Washington's National Gallery of Art, the exhibit  traveled from there to the Art Institute of Chicago, then to the Dallas Museum  of Art, and was initially scheduled to conclude this February at New York's  Metropolitan Museum of Art. Lenders weren't keen on loaning their works for too  long. But big crowds and a little persuasion apparently paid off.    "We were able to convince the National Gallery, (exhibit funder) Southwestern  Bell Foundation, lenders, and the O'Keeffe estate that a West Coast venue would  be not just desirable but essential," said Earl A. Powell, County Museum of Art  director. The artist's estate loaned about one-third of 101 paintings and  drawings on view through June 18.    O'Keeffe, whose giant, sensuous flowers and transcendent Southwestern desert  landscapes made her one of America's best-known and best-loved artists years  before she died in 1986 at age 98, seems likely to cause long lines to form on  Wilshire Boulevard.    Already about 45,000 tickets have been sold for the artist's first extensive  posthumous exhibit, and the County Museum's membership, which has totaled about  81,000 since 1984, leaped to 84,000 after an enrollment campaign keyed to the  show offered new members two free tickets, officials said.    Chiefly for conservation reasons, the local exhibit contains about 20 fewer  pieces than the traveling version, but it is essentially the same show, Powell  said.    O'Keeffe, who wed photographer Alfred Stieglitz, left for months at a time the  man she deeply loved to paint in the New Mexican desert, and has projected a  pervasive, though perhaps not entirely accurate, persona of staunch  independence and reclusion.    But it had been nearly two decades since her last major retrospective and,  while everybody knew about O'Keeffe the person, "a whole generation was  unfamiliar with O'Keeffe the painter," said co-curator Juan Hamilton,  representative of the O'Keeffe estate and a ceramic sculptor who cared for the  artist during the last 13 years of her life. (In a much-publicized controversy,  Hamilton's share of O'Keeffe's $79-million estate was recently reduced from 70%  to 10% after relatives challenged her will.)    The exhibit, not a definitive retrospective but a selective, chronological  survey, strives to remedy this ignorance about the artist, he said.    In addition to the artist's iconic desert and flower images, there are  O'Keeffe's early charcoal drawings -- the works that led to her professional  discovery by Stieglitz, then a leading New York avant-garde art dealer --  brilliantly colored-abstractions, views of New York and huge cloud paintings  she made in her 70s.    But the show may also shine new light on O'Keeffe's personality with a  catalogue that presents some of her previously unpublished letters.    "For the first time, people are able to hear her speaking directly," said  National Gallery researcher Sarah Greenough, who edited the letters. "I think a  very different side of O'Keeffe emerges."    A correspondence from 1922 reveals that the artist loathed critics'  interpretations of her work as "shameless" or "throbbing" symbols of female  sexual anatomy, Greenough said.     Tickets for "Georgia O'Keeffe" are on sale at all Ticketron locations and at  the County Museum of Art. Information: (213) 857-6110.

headline:   STAGE WATCH : QUESTIONS CONTINUE OVER TAPER'S 'SANSEI'; 'STAND-UP' LATEST  CONTENDER FOR MAIN STAGE   
text:   Examine the credits for "Sansei" at the Mark Taper Forum.    It was "created and performed by" Hiroshima, the band that is its subject. It  was "developed and directed by" Robert Egan. The dramaturg was Brian Kulick.    But no one wrote it.    "Sansei" was drawn from taped reminiscences by four members of Hiroshima. The  raw material was edited into a script, a collaboration between the members of  the band and Egan.    As the first Asian-American project to appear in a Mark Taper Forum mainstage  season, "Sansei" is the subject of much comment among the Asian-American  theatrical community. One question that has arisen: Why wasn't a writer hired  to tie together the band members' stories into a real play?    "It was entertaining, but there could have been much more meat to it, more  insight, more of a structure," said actress and former television producer/host  Sumi Haru. Rattling off a list of seven Asian-American writers, she said, "They  know how to put a play together. I wonder if they were asked."    " 'Sansei' is not a play; it's more of a concert piece," said Mako, former  director of East-West Players. "Each member of the band had something to say,  but it was told as opposed to shown. It lacked conflict." The Taper "deserves a  little pat on the back for doing something" about Asian-Americans, he added,  "but I wish it had been a lot stronger, more pertinent. The language wasn't  heightened. Obviously they (the members of Hiroshima) are not playwrights."    Jude Narita, whose "Coming Into Passion/Song for a Sansei" won a best play  award Monday from the Assn. of Asian/Pacific American Artists, acknowledged  that she "was quite moved to see Asians on stage (in 'Sansei'). It was a  wonderful concert." She appreciated that the Taper supported "Sansei" "to the  point of putting it into the big house" (main stage).    However, Narita pointed to the contrast between the "crafted" quality of  Hiroshima's music and "the casualness of the language" in "Sansei." "Writing  for the theater is as demanding as writing a song and deserves as much  respect," she continued. "You have to give up your commitment to the actual  spoken word (from the taped interviews) and springboard off the thoughts. By  remaining so true to the exact words, they missed the universal."    " 'Sansei' is an entertaining and energetic endeavor," wrote critic John Saito  Jr. in the Japanese-English newspaper Rafu Shimpo. But he didn't find enough  "fiber in the plot."    Not everyone missed the presence of a writer. "I don't see how a writer could  have been more sensitive, more aware," said Dolores Wong, president of Asian  American Friends of Center Theatre Group, which raised approximately $50,000  for "Sansei" at a benefit. She admitted "a certain amount of anxiety selling  tickets for a performance for which we hadn't even seen a script." But she's  now "very proud" of "Sansei," calling it "very honest, fair, authentic."    Taper artistic director/producer Gordon Davidson said the decision not to use a  writer was the band's -- and he respected it. "When we decided it would be  their story (an earlier idea was for Hiroshima to provide music for another  story), they wanted to tell it in their own words. It was a delicate  experience. I knew it would yield certain results and certain problems. Clearly  it lacks a writer's ability to take that material and transform it. But what  I've got in return is a certain honesty and simplicity."    Davidson added that "we weren't making a play. We were making something new."  However, he also said, "the logical next step would be to take that material  and see whether one could marry it with a writer. We'll play it, listen to it  and talk about how we can turn the documentary material into a more artful form  without losing the honesty."    Asked whether this process should have been completed before putting "Sansei"  on the main stage, Davidson replied: "I've got to be able to experiment on the  main stage. There's no way to do new work if you look at it as finished. Almost  all the work you do in theater is work in process." Besides, he added, a  smaller stage hardly could have accommodated the band with all of its  instruments and equipment.    Hiroshima leader Dan Kuramoto agreed that "if there is another life for  'Sansei,' we may consider (hiring a writer) then." And he recalled that at one  point in the development of the play, director Egan had furnished "a list of  writers, if we wanted to do that."    But "the veracity of the show had a raw appeal that (Egan) liked," added  Kuramoto. At Egan's suggestion, Kuramoto read some of Studs Terkel's oral  histories and used them as an inspiration.    Kuramoto himself has written plays. He studied the craft at San Francisco  State, he said, and a Bay Area company wanted to perform one of his plays when  he was only 18 years old. But he withdrew it, fearing that it wasn't ready yet.    Now 41, he's no longer willing to wait for perfection. "In theater, everyone  waits until it's too late," he said. "It's important to do it while the issues  are still boiling." Also, given the band's touring schedule, "we don't know  when we'll have another chance to do it."    He conceded that "a lot of refining needs to go into it. But I don't know of  any piece that couldn't stand a bit of touching up. I've seen many shows and  wondered what they were doing in front of a paying audience."    For Kuramoto, "how successful it is isn't as important as the fact that we're  moving in a direction that includes (Asian-Americans) above the Equity Waiver  level. Success is doing what you believe in. Hopefully there will be much  better pieces than ours, but we have to start somewhere."    Veteran actor Sab Shimono agreed: "It could have been better, but at least it's  there. I hope the Taper will bring in Asian writers soon, but at least they  used Asian actors. They could have used Joel Grey to play Dan Kuramoto."    LATE CUES: Some Taper main stage offerings do ascend from the lower rungs of  the Taper ladder. The latest candidate for such a move is "Stand-Up Tragedy,"  now playing the Taper Too and originally developed at the Taper Lab last fall.  Negotiations are under way to take it to the main stage, said a Taper  representative.    Meanwhile, Steven Banks is taking his "Home Entertainment Center" from the  Pasadena Playhouse's Balcony Theatre to the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills for  an April 13 opening. Susan Dietz, the Playhouse's artistic director, is  producing the venture (without Playhouse participation).    "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" is so unsinkable that it established a Long Beach  Civic Light Opera record for gross sales ($683,000 and counting) 45 days before  its opening on May 6. . . . "At Wit's End " has extended its run at the Coronet  through April 30. "Les Miserables" has added three more weeks; it will now play  through July 23.    Bring a non-perishable food or household item to the Doolittle Theatre box  office and you'll get two tickets for the price of one for the Saturday 8 p.m.  preview of Tom Stoppard's "Hapgood." All items will be donated to the  "Necessities of Life" program of AIDS Project Los Angeles. . . . George  Schaefer and Martin Tahse have organized a memorial gathering honoring actor  Maurice Evans, who died March 12. It's at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Globe  Playhouse, 1107 N. Kings Road.

headline:   MUSIC REVIEW;    ALICIA DE LARROCHA IN RECITAL AT ROYCE HALL   
text:   Alicia de Larrocha's latest recital program was a curious, but utterly  characteristic, thing of clear contrasts and an understated progression from  comparative abstraction to full-bodied pictorialism. Tuesday evening at Royce  Hall, she paired Schubert with an Iberian group; her previous recital here this  season had matched Mendelssohn and Albeniz.    In the overheated hall, the 65-year-old pianist began slowly, with a detached,  ill-balanced account of Schubert's C-minor Impromptu, D. 899, No. 1. She  communicated a much greater degree of involvement in a fleet performance of the  A-flat Impromptu, No. 4, in the same set.    The Sonata in A, D. 664, elicited a fully engaged performance. Larrocha allowed  the sentiment and lyricism gracious space, while keeping formal shapes taut, in  direct, evenly modulated playing.    After intermission, Larrocha switched from pastels to primary colors in oil for  a set culminating in Turina's "Sanlucar de Barrameda," appropriately subtitled  "Sonata Pintoresca." Her boldly etched, expressive playing clarified textures  and thematic links as well as painted moods with idiomatic flair.    Larrocha's complete control of rhythmic and articulative nuance, and her  formidable sense of concentrated direction, well served the "Tres Danzas  Caracteristicas" of Oscar Espla. She unwound the Habanera with sinuous ease,  let the Ronda Serrana glitter naturally, and drove the Sonatina Playera with  indomitable zest.    The "Sonatina pour Ivette" by Xavier Montsalvatge is at once austere and  playful, aristocratically ordered and vividly earthy. Larrocha set it forth  with clarity and brio, alert to inner tensions as well as surface sparkle.    In encore, Larrocha furthered the cause of sophisticated Iberiana with a  tenderly introverted account of Mompou's "El Secreto," and an intensely vital  performance of Falla's "Dance of Terror" from "El Amor Brujo," delivered as a  single fiery impulse.

headline:   TESTS SHOW ALAR TRACES ON APPLES IN 2 COUNTY STORES   
text:   Apples in two Los Angeles County supermarkets were found in independent tests  to contain residues of Alar, a potentially hazardous chemical that the stores'  suppliers had claimed was no longer used.    The tests, conducted for The Times by a private San Francisco laboratory, found  traces of Alar on apples sold at a Hughes market in Monterey Park and a Lucky  store in Bell. Officers of both stores said their growers had pledged in  letters not to use the chemical. Lucky was apparently confident enough of the  claim to post it on signs on produce shelves.    The test results demonstrate that supermarkets, increasingly sensitive to  consumer concerns about pesticides and chemicals, may not be able to guarantee  the purity of their produce without independent laboratory verification. Some  environmentalists are demanding an immediate ban on Alar.    In response to the results, a spokeswoman for Lucky said the chain pulled the  apples from the market where The Times purchased them last week and will test  them to verify The Times' findings. In the meantime, she said, Lucky's no-Alar  signs will probably be revised.    Hughes, concerned by the findings, began testing apples in its warehouse  Wednesday and found Alar residues on three different brands of red apples. A  Hughes vice president ordered its stores to pull those brands from the shelves  late Wednesday afternoon and announced that the chain will now test apples in  its warehouse on a regular basis.    No Alar residue was detected in samples from two other stores, a Vons in La  Canada and a Ralphs in South Pasadena. These two supermarket chains verify  their growers' claims of Alar-free fruit with independent laboratory testing.    The amounts detected in The Times' tests were substantially below the allowable  limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An EPA official said  Alar residues at or below the allowable amount -- set before the chemical was  linked to cancer -- could cause health problems over a lifetime of consumption  but not in the short run. The agency next year is expected to ban the chemical,  which is used to improve the appearance and extend the shelf life mainly of red  apples.    "The finding of Alar in so-called Alar-free apples demonstrates why we need the  EPA to take this chemical off the market once and for all," said Lawrie Mott, a  senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental  group that released a controversial study earlier this month about the  chemical's effects on children.      Private Lab Hired    The Times last week purchased eight to 10 apples of each red and yellow variety  at the four stores and hired Anresco Inc., a private San Francisco laboratory,  to test them for residues of Alar, the trade name for the chemical daminozide.  The laboratory used a testing method recognized by the EPA and the Food and  Drug Administration.    Of 23 samples tested, five had detectable levels. The EPA's allowable limit for  the residue is 20 parts per million. The EPA does not, however, say that apples  containing that amount or less are safe.    "We aren't saying there is any level that is absolutely without risk," said EPA  spokesman Alber Heier. "However, we think the risk is small."    Agency officials say the average Alar residue detected on apples is one part  per million -- 1/20th of the limit. For every 100,000 people who eat apples  containing that average amount, there will be about 4.5 additional cancer cases  over the lifetime of those people, according to the EPA's calculations.      Range of Findings    The amounts found in The Times' tests ranged from .97 ppm to 9 ppm. Anne  Lindsay, director of pesticide registration for the EPA, said any residue above  1 ppm probably results from current use of Alar. Smaller amounts may be found  on apples one or more years after the grower has stopped using the chemical  because it persists in the soil and root system of the tree.    At Hughes, a sample of McIntoshes was found to have residue of 9 ppm. A sample  of large red Delicious apples had a detectable level of .97 ppm and "fancy" red  Delicious had a level of 3.7 ppm.    At Lucky, a large red Delicious sample showed 1.8 ppm and a regular red  Delicious sample had 4.1 ppm.    Judy Decker, a spokeswoman for Lucky Stores, said the chain will decide whether  to make changes in its produce policies after receiving the results of its own  laboratory analysis. She noted that Lucky produce signs say the chain has been  asking growers for three years to certify that they do not use Alar.    "The sign is still correct as far as I am concerned," Decker said. "The grower  has certified to us that he has not used Alar."      Variance of Claims    But claims of certification vary, said Tom Hale, president of the Washington  Apple Commission, which represents 5,000 apple growers in the state. Some  growers certify that no Alar was used to the best of their knowledge. Others  certify that actual testing was done at harvest time.    "I believe the certifications that are occurring are honest," Hale said. "But  I'm not saying it's foolproof and something couldn't slip through."    Harland Polk, vice president of sales and marketing at Hughes, acknowledged  that levels of certification from growers vary.    Hughes will now post signs in stores informing customers that samples of their  apple shipments are tested for the chemical, Polk said. Of seven apple samples  tested by the store Wednesday, four had no traces of Alar. But some red  Delicious apples had 1.2 ppm; others had 2.5 ppm and still others showed 3.6  ppm, Polk said.    Hughes used the same method of testing as Anresco, but the apples tested by  Hughes may have come from different growers.    Polk said Hughes had letters from each of those suppliers saying that Alar was  not used on their apples to the best of their knowledge. "Those (apples) will  be pulled from sale and returned to the supplier, and if it is appropriate we  will take legal action against those suppliers," Polk said.    Stores say that once apples are on the shelves, it is difficult to determine  who the growers were.    The EPA estimates that 5% of fresh apples are now treated with Alar. Lindsay,  director of the agency's pesticide registration division, said that estimate is  based on reports from county and state agricultural officials who work with  growers, the amount of Alar production reported by its manufacturer and private  services that collect such information.    Lindsay conceded, however, that the agency must rely in part on what growers  say they are doing because "there is no official national reporting system of  what people use."    Consumers Union, the New York-based publisher of Consumer Reports, challenged  that estimate in a report showing that 55% of raw apples purchased in the New  York region contained Alar. The organization's test showed residues ranging  from .4 to 2.3 ppm on 11 of 20 samples of red apples tested.    Consumer Union called on the EPA to ban Alar "as soon as possible." In the  meantime, consumers should not stop eating raw apples "because the health  benefits of apples outweigh the very low risks" associated with Alar, said  Consumers Union spokeswoman Marnie Goodman.    Times researcher Angela Justin contributed to this article.      TESTING FOR ALAR     Apples from four stores -- Vons, Ralphs, Hughes and Lucky -- were tested for  daminozide, a growth-regulator marketed under the brand name Alar, which is  suspected of causing cancer. Twenty-three samples of eight to 10 apples each  were tested. No Alar was found in the Vons or Ralphs samples. Five samples --  three from Hughes and two from Lucky -- showed traces of the chemical. The  legal limit for Alar on apples is 20 parts per million. Anresco Inc., a San  Francisco firm, did the testing for The Times.     The laboratory, established in 1943, tests for pesticides, preservatives,  nutrients and other compounds in food, usually for private companies. The  laboratory used the government-approved PAM II testing method in which apples  are put in a blender, mixed with sodium hydroxide, titanium trichloride, an  antifoam agent and zinc granules. The mixture is heated and decomposed into  unsymmetrical dymethyl hydrazine (UDMH), a breakdown product of Alar. Results  are read in a spectrometer, with color intensities proportional to the amount  of Alar in the sample. The test has a margin of error of plus or minus 4%.

headline:   'JUNK BOND' KING MILKEN INDICTED FOR STOCK FRAUD   
text:   Michael Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert "junk bond" wizard in Beverly Hills  who revolutionized U.S. corporate finance and raised funds for dozens of  corporate raids, was indicted Wednesday on federal racketeering, insider  trading and other securities fraud counts.    The long-expected indictment also named Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, and a  former Drexel trader, Bruce L. Newberg.    If convicted on the racketeering charges, the three could face an astronomical  amount in financial penalties: The indictment asks that they forfeit a total of  $1.85 billion, representing their salaries, other compensation and their share  of Drexel profits, all earned in what the government charges was a continuing  criminal enterprise operated at the New York-based investment banking firm.      Fines Could Be Doubled    In addition, the federal racketeering law, known as the Racketeer Influenced  and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, at least theoretically could subject  them to twice that amount in fines. This means each defendant could face up to  $3.7 billion in fines on the two RICO charges. They also face additional fines  on the other counts totaling in the millions of dollars.    Michael Milken faces a maximum jail sentence of about 300 years, with lesser  amounts for the other two defendants.    The indictment apparently marks the end of Milken's 20-year career at the firm  that his junk bond operation transformed from a second-rank investment bank to  one of the powerhouses on Wall Street. Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield  debt securities.    Immediately after the 98-count indictment was returned by a federal grand jury,  Drexel said that Milken, 42, and his brother, 40, had requested and been  granted leaves of absence. John Kissick, formerly head of the firm's corporate  finance department in Beverly Hills, has been expected to take Michael Milken's  place.    The criminal charges result from the biggest criminal securities fraud  investigation ever undertaken by the government. The inquiry has been under way  for over two years. Benito Romano, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said "this  specific investigation is continuing" and didn't rule out the possibility that  additional individuals may be charged soon.    The charges filed Wednesday mean that Newberg is now facing two separate  racketeering indictments. He is also named as a defendant in an indictment  returned last July relating to Princeton/Newport Partners, a small investment  firm that did business with Drexel. The charges against him in the two  indictments appear to cover the same general chain of events.    Lowell Milken, a lawyer, gave up a promising legal career in the 1970s to help  his brother run Drexel's Beverly Hills office. The indictment charges that  Lowell "was his brother's principal adviser in the conduct of the conspiracy."    Sources at the firm said the indictment of Michael Milken probably would clear  the way for Drexel to swiftly settle civil charges filed by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. Milken's continued presence at the firm was a major  sticking point in the talks.    Settlement with the SEC, in turn, would remove the last obstacle to Drexel's  carrying out its pledge to plead guilty to six criminal counts and pay $650  million in financial penalties. The firm had entered into that agreement in  December, in part to avoid more serious racketeering charges and a possible  huge forfeiture of assets.    The 110-page indictment returned Wednesday appears to closely follow the civil  charges contained in an SEC lawsuit filed in September against Drexel and the  Milkens. It contains only a few charges that weren't in the SEC's complaint and  leaves out a number that were.    The indictment accuses Michael Milken of a prolonged pattern of insider  trading, stock market manipulation and defrauding clients. It claims that he  sought to enrich himself through self-dealing at the same time that he was  acting on behalf of Drexel's customers.      Areas of Wrongdoing    The indictment charges three broad areas of wrongdoing. One involves  transactions with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who pleaded guilty to  a single criminal charge and gave prosecutors the information that touched off  the Drexel investigation. The indictment charges that Milken used Boesky's firm  to hide illegal stock trading.    The second broad area involves transactions with Princeton/Newport Partners, in  which Drexel and Milken allegedly helped Princeton/Newport carry out tax fraud  through sham securities trades with Drexel. Among other charges, the indictment  alleges that Drexel used Princeton/Newport to illegally manipulate the price of  COMB Co. securities in 1985.    The third general area involves alleged straight insider trading in the  securities of Lorimar Inc. and Viacom Inc. by Michael Milken.    Although the government could immediately ask a federal judge to freeze the  three defendants' personal assets, Romano, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said  he probably will not do that. He said his office has been negotiating with the  defendants' lawyers and added that he expects a bond to be posted by the three  men, covering at least a part of the amount they may be required to forfeit to  the government.      Expects Assurances    Romano said he expects to receive written assurances that assets covering the  rest will not be dissipated before a trial is held.    When asked about the huge amounts, among the largest that individuals have been  asked to forfeit in a RICO case, Romano said the numbers represented "the  extraordinary levels of compensation and stock ownership in the (illegal)  Drexel enterprise" paid to Michael Milken and the others. The indictment notes  that Milken received $1.1 billion in direct compensation from Drexel from 1984  through 1987, as well as millions in other forms of compensation, and that he  is Drexel's largest individual stockholder, owning about 6% of the firm.    According to the indictment, Milken's pay was $123.8 million in 1984 and $135  million in 1985, then more than doubled in 1986 to $294.8 million. In 1987, he  was paid $550 million. The indictment says that, during those years, Milken's  personal compensation amounted to between 28% and 44% of the junk bond  department's gross revenues.    Lowell Milken allegedly received $102 million in direct compensation during the  same period.    Drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the  firm calls for it to withhold nearly all of Michael Milken's compensation from  1988, as well as about $13 million owed to Lowell Milken. But the brothers are  challenging that in court as a violation of their constitutional rights, and it  will be up to a federal judge to decide.    The $1.85-billion total that the three are being asked to forfeit was based in  part on calculations of how much each of them had received from Drexel. But  Romano said that, under the law, each of them could be held "jointly and  separately" liable for the full amount. Michael Milken has been reported to  have a personal net worth of nearly $1 billion.    Arthur L. Liman, one of Milken's main defense lawyers, said in a written  statement that Milken "will plead not guilty with confidence that in a fair  trial he will be acquitted." Liman said: "The charges against Mr. Milken are  essentially a repetition of the accusations made by Ivan Boesky and others as  they bargained for leniency or immunity from prosecution."    Both Milkens strongly denied the charges against them. Michael Milken said in a  written press release: "I am confident that in the end I will be vindicated."  Lowell Milken said that "the proof will show that I had virtually no contacts  with Ivan Boesky, and that I had little, if anything, to do with the events the  prosecutors misrepresent in order to construct their charges."    He added that "I have been thrown into this indictment because of a fact in  which I take great pride -- I am Michael Milken's brother."    Michael Armstrong, Lowell's lawyer, said in a brief interview that he found  little that was unexpected in the indictment. "It seems like little more than a  rehash of what the SEC came out with six months ago," he said.    In another statement, two lawyers representing Newberg accused the government  of seeking to punish Newberg for refusing to become a prosecution witness by  indicting him twice on racketeering charges.    "The second RICO indictment of Mr. Newberg, containing essentially the same  charges as those in the first indictment, is a total perversion of the RICO  statute," the lawyers said. Newberg could not be reached for comment. He left  Drexel when it became apparent that he was going to be charged in the  Princeton/Newport case.    Romano said that none of the three would be arrested. Instead, they will be  allowed to present themselves for arraignment, probably one week from today.  The government requested that U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood be assigned to  the case, because she is already presiding over the case in which Drexel is  expected to plead guilty to six charges.    The indictment conspicuously leaves out a number of names of Drexel employees  who reportedly have been under investigation. Several of them had received  "target" letters from prosecutors warning them that they faced indictment.  Defense lawyers said they believe that the government may file additional  indictments, or file a new indictment, superseding the one handed up Wednesday,  that would include more individuals as defendants.

headline:   DEFENSE PROBE FIGURE LIKELY TO PLEAD GUILTY   
text:   Woodland Hills, Calif., defense consultant Fred H. Lackner will plead guilty  Friday to federal fraud and bribery charges in the Ill Wind Pentagon corruption  investigation, sources told The Times Wednesday.    In an agreement almost identical to that struck last week between prosecutors  and former Navy procurement official Stuart E. Berlin, Lackner will plead  guilty in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., to charges of wire fraud,  conspiracy and bribery of a public official.    He faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison and fines of $750,000.    Lackner, 52, will admit his role in a scheme to pay Berlin about $6,000 for  inside information on two Navy electronics contracts, the sources said. Lackner  and an associate, defense consultant William L. Parkin, sold the data to  Teledyne Industries Inc., of Newbury Park, Calif., and Hazeltine Corp. of Long  Island, N.Y., to help the firms win lucrative Navy business.    With his plea, Lackner would become the 12th person to admit to charges arising  from the Ill Wind inquiry. Teledyne and Hazeltine also have pleaded guilty to  charges of conspiracy, fraud and lying to the government.    Three Teledyne officials face trial, beginning Monday, on charges of using  Parkin and Lackner to bribe the Navy official for inside information.    The three-year investigation into corruption in military weapons-buying broke  open last June when agents of the Naval Investigative Service and the FBI  searched the homes and offices of four dozen defense contractors, consultants  and government officials. The inquiry has been described as the broadest ever  into fraud and bribery in the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year procurement  system.      More Charges Likely    Federal prosecutors, under the direction of Henry E. Hudson, U.S. Attorney for  the Eastern District of Virginia, are continuing to build cases against a  number of defense consultants and Pentagon officials who have not been  indicted.    Their chief target is said to be former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn R.  Paisley, who left the Navy in 1987 to become a highly paid consultant.  Investigators are pursuing allegations that Paisley bribed his former Navy  colleagues to steer contracts to some of the nation's biggest defense  contractors.    Another target is former defense consultant William M. Galvin, a Paisley  associate and a well-known figure in the defense industry. Attorneys for  Paisley and Galvin have asserted that their clients are innocent of any  wrongdoing.    Sources said Wednesday that Lackner decided to plead guilty and cooperate with  prosecutors after Berlin, 51, and Parkin, 65, confessed to their roles in the  conspiracy. Parkin, who attempted suicide two weeks ago, pleaded guilty to  bribery and fraud charges last Monday.    The two men are scheduled to be sentenced June 3.    The prosecutor's case was built largely around wiretapped conversations between  Lackner and Parkin in which the two made veiled references to money for Berlin  as "a little green" and "a lot of spaghetti and meatballs."    FBI surveillance cameras also recorded Lackner's withdrawing money from a bank  and later meeting with Berlin, federal investigative sources said. But the  actual transfer of funds was never witnessed, they said.    Berlin admitted last week that, beginning in 1985, he sold confidential  information on a Navy electronics contract to Lackner and Parkin, who in turn  sold it to officers of a Teledyne subsidiary for $160,000.      Documents Show Deceit    Parkin and Lackner agreed to split the Teledyne fee and pay a one-third share  to Berlin. But, according to government documents, they lied to Berlin about  how much they were paid and gave him only a tiny fraction of their fees.    Teledyne, in the plea agreement under which it will pay the government at least  $4.3 million in fines and reimbursements, called the plan a "corrupt and  illegal arrangement" to subvert the Pentagon's procurement process.    Prosecutors said that Lackner, Parkin and Berlin were involved in a similar  scheme to help Hazeltine win a different Navy electronics contract. Lackner and  Parkin again allegedly misrepresented the size of their fee and gave Berlin  less than a one-third share.    Carla Lazzareschi reported from Los Angeles and John M. Broder from Washington.

headline:   HALLEY'S COMET MAY BE A DEEP SPACE 'INTERLOPER'   
text:   Halley's comet, which has fascinated scientists and lay people alike because of  its periodic and sometimes spectacular return to the Earth's neighborhood, may  have originated somewhere beyond the solar system, making it truly a visitor  from deep space, scientists reported Wednesday.    It has long been thought that the periodic comet came from a cloud of "dirty  snowballs" on the fringe of the solar system, but a new chemical analysis  suggests that Halley may be different from all other objects in the solar  system and could have been an "interloper" that was captured by the sun's  gravity as it passed nearby.    That scenario offers one explanation for why Halley now appears to be somewhat  different than scientists had thought, said astronomer Susan Wyckoff of Arizona  State University.    Using a technique that has allowed astronomers to examine the chemical  composition of a comet for the first time, Wyckoff and a team of researchers  discovered that the ratio between carbon 12 and carbon 13 in Halley "differs  from all other solar system objects examined, including terrestrial and lunar  rocks, meteorites and the atmospheres of large planets," she said.    The National Science Foundation, which sponsored the research along with the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, announced the results Wednesday.  The findings are also reported in the April 1 issue of the Astrophysical  Journal.    The scientists used a sensitive instrument that reveals the chemical  composition of a celestial body through a process called "spectral analysis."    She said even an instrument as sensitive as the one used by the team is  effective only on bright objects. The big question now remaining is whether any  other comets have the same composition as Halley.    "There's another bright one coming in sometime this summer," Wyckoff said. That  comet, called Brorsen-Metcalf, should be bright enough for chemical analysis,  and like Halley, it passes this way rarely.    If it turns out that Halley is different than all other comets, "it might mean  that it was a captured comet," she said. "The sun just ventured too close to an  interloper comet" and the comet became trapped in the sun's gravitational  field.    That would explain one thing that has mystified scientists for centuries:  Halley travels in the wrong direction as it orbits the sun.    "Only five out of 124 (periodic comets that return again and again to the inner  solar system) go around the sun backwards," she said. "People have been puzzled  by that."    That could be explained if Halley was an interloper captured by the sun's  gravity and it entered the solar system in such a way that it ended up going  around the sun in the opposite direction of nearly everything else.    An alternative reason could be that a star exploded nearby just as the our sun  was forming, "splattering parts of the solar system with carbon 12 material,"  Wyckoff said. Some materials, possibly similar to whatever formed Halley's  comet, may have been somehow shielded from the blast and ended up with less  carbon 12 than others.    That could explain why the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is 89 to 1  throughout most of the solar system, including on Earth, and only 65 to 1 in  Halley's comet, according to the new findings.    Whatever the explanation, Halley's comet continues to engage the astronomical  community despite the fact that it long ago disappeared from the southern sky  on its journey back toward the outer edge of the solar system. It takes about  76 years for the comet to complete one orbit, and it has been observed for more  than 3,000 years.

text:   The Guatemalan government promised to replace the warden and all guards at a  besieged prison and work to reform prisons nationwide if armed inmates  surrender and set hostages free. The proposal was an attempt to end a  four-day-old uprising and free hundreds of inmates and family members in the  compound at the Pavon prison farm, about 15 miles east of Guatemala City.  Earlier, authorities cut off water and power to try to end the mutiny by  prisoners demanding reduced sentences, better food and treatment and  replacement of the warden. About 110 prisoners who took no part in the  rebellion escaped and were transferred to other institutions.

text:   A loan to rebuild a chemical plant has been approved after being delayed until  the plant's owner was cleared of suspicion that it knew of secret attempts to  ship a rocket fuel element from its plant to Iran. The $92-million loan for the  plant, vital to the nation's rocket fuel supply, was approved by the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration nearly a year after the plant blew up at  Henderson, Nev. The loan from a Seattle bank, to be repaid almost entirely by  federal taxpayers, is to Pacific Engineering &amp; Production Co. NASA and the  Defense Department have agreed to buy 140 million pounds of ammonium  perchlorate -- a rocket fuel oxidizer -- over seven years. The destroyed plant  is about 30% rebuilt but at a new location: Cedar City, Utah.

headline:   EXPERTS HOPE BRIDGE FALL WON'T DELAY TROLLEY LINE   
text:   Los Angeles County transit officials were cautiously optimistic Wednesday that  the collapse of a partly completed 400-ton trolley bridge will not  significantly delay the summer, 1990, scheduled opening of the first line of  the region's multibillion-dollar mass transit system.    While the cause of Tuesday morning's spectacular accident was still to be  determined, contractors were developing plans to make up construction time lost  when the concrete trestle for the Los Angeles-to-Long Beach trolley fell onto  Firestone Boulevard in an unincorporated area of South Los Angeles.    Eight people were injured, none seriously. They included two men who were  trapped in a pickup truck that was crushed by the falling bridge, five bridge  workers and a pedestrian.    Workers moved quickly to reopen the busy thoroughfare, which officials  originally predicted might be blocked for three days. By early Wednesday  morning, the 110-foot span had been broken up and removed and all four lanes  were open to traffic.    Meanwhile, an interagency team of state and county engineers began a  two-pronged investigation to determine the cause of the near-tragedy and to  ensure that other bridge-building projects in the county are safe.    Attention focused on the timber-and-steel temporary structure that had  supported the bridge. One transit official told The Times that, for no apparent  reason, the temporary support structure, or "falsework," appeared to shift  several feet and toppled "like a domino."    There was still no estimate of total damage Wednesday. But officials with the  county Transportation Commission, which is building the trolley system, said  their insurance would cover losses.    The $720-million, 22-mile Long Beach trolley, dubbed the Blue Line, is about  70% complete and will be the first in the system to carry passengers.    A segment from Long Beach to the southern edge of the Central City financial  district is scheduled to open in July, 1990. A final leg, which will drop into  a subway station beneath 7th and Flower streets in downtown Los Angeles, is not  expected to open until 1991.      Connecting Links    The Blue Line will connect with the Metro Rail subway, or Red Line, and the  Century Freeway trolley, or Green Line, which are both scheduled to open in  1993.    Tuesday's bridge collapse was the largest mishap so far in the county's  ambitious mass transit construction program, which includes the RTD's Metro  Rail subway and the commission's trolley lines that planners hope will some day  extend for 150 miles. Thus far, the mass transit program's problems mostly have  been construction delays.    Last year, however, there was an embarrassing foul-up on another Long Beach  trolley bridge being built across Compton Creek. Cracks developed in the  surface of the bridge because steel reinforcing was placed improperly and  commission inspectors did not catch it. The problem has since been corrected,  with the contractor agreeing to pick up the added costs.    The investigation of Tuesday's collapse -- a mishap that engineering experts  described as highly unusual -- was expected to take several weeks. A task force  of bridge experts and public works engineers from Caltrans, the county Public  Works Department and the Transportation Commission was being assembled  Wednesday.    "We're going to get in there and do a thorough investigation and analysis of  exactly what occurred," said Ed McSpedon, the commission's rail construction  chief. "What we do know is that something unusual happened on that south  abutment" where the trestle fell.      Temporary Structure    McSpedon has emphasized that it was a temporary support structure that failed,  not the bridge itself. He noted that the span was "still very much intact"  after the accident, he said.    Concerns about the quality of construction on the Firestone bridge contract,  which includes two separate spans, were raised last year in an internal memo by  a design engineer on the project.    Those concerns included possible soil settlement problems with a temporary  support structure similar to the one that apparently failed Tuesday, as well as  the need for field engineers to be more aggressive in enforcing contract  requirements.    A Transportation Commission official insisted Wednesday that those concerns  were addressed shortly after they were raised last year, as the first of the  two spans was being built.    "All of the issues were responded to and reviewed," said commission spokeswoman  Erica Gobel. She said the memo was part of the "normal checks and balances" and  "healthy dialogue" between engineers on such projects.    The engineer, who works for a consulting consortium hired by the commission,  has declined to comment. He referred inquiries to the commission.    Gobel said it is the commission's policy that its own officials, rather than  contractors and their employees, respond to news media inquiries.    Morrison-Knudsen, the bridge contractor, also declined comment.    SURVIVOR'S STORY    "My only thought was to get out" after bridge collapsed on his vehicle, driver  says. Page 8

headline:   U.S. TO TAKE LEAD IN 'WHISTLE-BLOWER' SUIT AGAINST LITTON   
text:   The Justice Department disclosed Wednesday that it will take over prosecution  of a private "whistle-blower" lawsuit accusing a Litton Industries subsidiary  of overcharging the government by at least $25 million for computer work on  hundreds of defense contracts.    The lawsuit, ordered unsealed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Matthew M. Byrne  Jr. in Los Angeles, accuses the company's Woodland Hills computer division of  boosting charges to the government for computer time so it could charge  commercial customers less.    Lawyers representing the former Litton data systems analyst who initially filed  the suit, James Carton of Moorpark, said the suit could make the company liable  for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.    Justice Department lawyers declined to comment on the case, but in court papers  unsealed Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said the  government has completed its investigation of Carton's allegations and has  elected to "assume primary responsibility for prosecuting the action."    Litton, one of the nation's leading suppliers of defense electronics equipment,  said there is no truth to any of the allegations and said the company had in  fact saved the government money by sharing computer time with commercial  customers.      Claims Money Saved    "We're aware of the general allegations being made, and what we would like to  say is that in fact the exact opposite is true," said company spokesman John  Thom. "There's been no overcharging. In fact, there's been substantial  reduction in costs for the data processing services that division charges.  We've been saving American taxpayers literally millions of dollars by selling  to commercial customers."    Under the federal False Claims Act, private citizens like Carton who believe  they have evidence of wrongdoing against the government are allowed to file  lawsuits that are kept under seal until the government investigates the  allegations. If the government decides there is merit to the case, it can elect  to take over the lawsuit and share a portion of any damages collected with the  original "whistle-blower."    "It's precisely the kind of case that the False Claims Act was designed to  unearth," said John Phillips, one of the lawyers representing Carton. "No  government auditor would have turned this up, regardless of how careful and  thorough they were."    The lawsuit alleges that Litton, apparently in an attempt to attract more  commercial computer customers, did not charge commercial clients for using  Litton's computer memory banks beyond a certain "cap" level.      Government Clients    There were no such "caps" for government contract clients, however, and the  government has ended up paying the excess overhead for commercial customers,  the suit alleges.    Carton, 46, said in an interview that he discovered the problem when he was  asked as technical director of the Woodland Hills division to do a  profitability study of the company's computer clients.    Carton said he discovered within a few days that there was no way to determine  how much profit Litton derived from each customer because the accounting system  between government and commercial clients was so intertwined. "I was deep into  the bowels of the software that runs the machine, and I was apparently touching  some nerves," he said.    Carton said he confronted his superiors with his findings -- that the  government was clearly being overcharged for computer services -- but got no  response.    Phillips said he believes that Litton officials deliberately designed the  accounting system to pass excess costs to the government. "It was conscious, it  was deliberate, it was planned, and they were reaping the benefits of it all  along," he said.      Lawsuit Initiated    Carton filed the lawsuit about a year after he left the company on friendly  terms in 1987. But he continued to work as a consultant for Litton and believes  that the company has continued to mischarge the government.    Litton officials declined to discuss details of the company's accounting  system, and also declined to say what proportion of the company's computer  customers are commercial clients.    But Thom did say that sharing computer time between government and private  customers allowed for economies of scale that were passed off in the form of  savings to the government.    "We're stunned by the fact that we would get sued over such a matter, when  we're saving the government money," he said.

text:   A 14-month-old girl was killed in Azusa on Wednesday when her uncle  accidentally drove his car over the toddler, police said.    Jorge Curiel, 34, returned to his home on North Alameda Avenue at about 1 p.m.  and honked his horn, signaling his 4-year-old daughter to come out and open the  gate, said Lt. Karen Pihlak. Curiel's daughter ran outside, opened the gate and  entered the car with her father, a routine they practiced every day, police  said.    Unknown to either Curiel or his daughter, "her cousin had crawled out of the  house following her," Pihlak said. "The little girl crawled into the driveway  where she could not be seen by either her uncle or her cousin. He ran over her,  crushing her under the left front wheel."

Van Orden has repaired the statues  12 times over the last decade, replacing arms and heads that were broken off  and once even dynamited.    Van Orden had thought he would not be able to repair the statue after the most  recent attack by vandals, because he has cancer. Doctors say he may live only  another two months.    However, after a recent Times story about the statue and Van Orden, he received  nearly $600 in donations. The support persuaded him to repair Loy's statue one  more time.    "I decided I couldn't abandon her," he said. "I had to return one more time,  this is my life's work and after I finish this job, I feel I can pass the job  on to someone else."

headline:   FIRST GOVERNOR TO VISIT;    DEUKMEJIAN GETS WARM WELCOME IN KOREATOWN   
text:   Sounding more like a candidate than a lame-duck politician, Gov. George  Deukmejian used his first official visit to Koreatown Wednesday to tout his  efforts to reduce crime, aid small business and improve trade with Pacific Rim  nations.    In a pointed reference to his predecessor, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.,  Deukmejian took credit for appointing "over 700 common-sense judges" during his  tenure in office and signing new laws strengthening criminal penalties.  Deukmejian has repeatedly criticized Brown in the past for his judicial  appointments, especially that of former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird.      First Visit    The 200 business leaders, who paid $20 apiece to attend the luncheon with the  governor, greeted Deukmejian with a standing ovation but seemed more interested  in his presence than the 20-minute speech he gave.    "This is really the first time that a governor has visited Koreatown," said  Edward R. Borcherdt, chairman of the Los Angeles Pusan Sister City Committee.  "They're very excited about it, because it is a recognition of the importance  of the Korean-American community in this city and this state."      Economic Strength    Yoon Hee Kim, president of the Korean American Coalition, said the governor's  visit symbolized the emerging political and economic strength of the  Korean-American community, whose population has exploded in the last two  decades.    An estimated 350,000 to 500,000 Korean-Americans now reside in Southern  California, with Los Angeles being home for the largest Korean population  outside Asia.    Kim said only in the last six years have Korean-Americans really begun to look  at themselves as a community and to register to vote in any numbers. Even so,  their voting strength -- she estimates it at 25,000 -- is still relatively  small. Kim said their voting patterns appear to be evenly divided between  Democrats and Republicans.      'Real Commitment'    "This is a community whose growth is absolutely phenomenal," she said. "Now  it's time that the Korean community work with outsiders, but at the same time,  we need a real commitment from mainstream politicians. The first and critical  thing for us is to bring them down to see the community."    Deukmejian declined an invitation to tour Koreatown, citing other commitments  in his schedule, but Craig Coleman, executive director of the Korea Society,  said he had agreed to lend his name to efforts to promote cultural and  educational exchanges between Korea and the United States.

headline:   COLLECTION AGENCY WILL SHUT DOWN ITS OPERATION   
text:   North America Credit Assn., one of the oldest and largest credit collection  agencies in Southern California, notified clients Wednesday that it will cease  operating April 30.    However, delinquent debtors will not be let off the hook. Companies that employ  collection agencies generally have several firms doing collection work for  them, and observers said competitors will quickly pick up the business.    An unknown number of employees will be laid off by the Pasadena company, which  has annually collected about $500,000 in delinquent credit payments on behalf  of companies such as GTE California, the Broadway department store chain and  First Interstate Bank.      200 Employees    Until about three weeks ago, the company reportedly had about 200 employees,  but owner Alexander Kreger told state authorities then that he was in the  process of reducing that number "significantly." A woman who answered the phone  at the company late Wednesday said the firm had no comment to make.    Alonzo D. Hall, chief of the Bureau of Collections and Investigative Services,  a unit of the State Department of Consumer Affairs that licenses the state's  678 collection agencies, said bureau auditors will begin examining the  company's books Monday. Hall said he had no idea what prompted the planned  shutdown.    For a time, he said, "we will take over the client accounts" to ensure that any  money already collected on behalf of clients is turned over to them.      55-Year-Old Agency    NACA, as the nearly 55-year-old agency is known, notified the bureau in  Wednesday's mail of its intention to close. Hall said he talked with Kreger  three weeks ago after receiving an anonymous tip that NACA was having financial  difficulties. Hall said Kreger at that time denied any financial woes but  acknowledged that he was reducing his staff.    At GTE California in Thousand Oaks, spokeswoman Ilona Smith acknowledged that  the company had been notified of NACA's decision to close but said the action  would have little effect on the phone company. "We have seven agencies that we  use, plus we do some of our own in-house collections before we ever go to an  agency," she said.    Whereas the closing is not expected to affect consumers, competitors  immediately set out to try to lure NACA's clients.    "That's dead meat out there now, and they will be picking at the bones," Hall  said. For the collection industry, he added, "it is really a big deal."

headline:   IT'S CHRISTMAS IN MARCH FOR GLENDALE'S RESIDENT SANTA   
text:   The Glendale city attorney who argued the case thought the ruling was nothing  short of vindication. So did his opponent, Santa Claus.    The two were squared off over a consent decree that Glendale's self-styled  Santa, Robert George, who keeps his home decorated for the holidays all year,  had signed in November, 1987. In it, George gave up, among other things, his  right to have visitors come to his home, except "bona fide" friends and  deliverymen. Later, on the advice of the American Civil Liberties Union, George  reneged on the clause, which the city said was designed to keep sightseeing  crowds under control.    On Monday, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals chided the city for what it  viewed as an "Orwellian" attempt to abridge a citizen's most fundamental rights  -- those of free speech and association.    But the court did not side with George entirely, noted Senior Assistant City  Atty. Scott Howard.    Nothing in the Constitution, the judges ruled, precludes a city from limiting  the number of "Styrofoam bells, baubles, artificial animals, statuaries, or any  other temporary or permanent Christmas-type ornaments . . . lights or lighting"  a resident can put up, or when.    Thus the Court of Appeals let stand George's agreement not to put up any more  decorations than he had on Oct. 1, 1987, and to turn the remaining ones on only  during the Christmas season.    "If there were to be any gripes at all about the decision, or any feelings of  disappointment, it is that the court allowed him to back out of an agreement,"  Howard said.    Santa, on the other hand, seemed a touch more ebullient.    "I beat the city," George said. "Santa Claus beat the city. They said I  couldn't do it, but I did."    The court was clearly piqued at the city's attempt to "ban members of the  public from entering or remaining on appellant's property" and to allow "no  more than two visits a month by terminally ill children," as the consent degree  called for.    The city argued that both parties understood that those words referred to the  large crowds of sightseers at George's home.    "This is not what the order says, nor can the First Amendment rights be the  subject of unwritten and, therefore, unenforceable understandings," the court  said.    Neither side, at this point, plans an appeal. But that doesn't mean the case is  closed.    George said he plans a victory party. He also intends to put back up the lights  he took down after the city began enforcement against year-round Christmas at  his rented home on Alameda Avenue.    Howard says he will be watching for illegal lights.

headline:   PROJECT ACTIVIST ALARMED BY HOUSING AUTHORITY REBUKE   
text:   Last month, Margarito Gutierrez went door to door in the Estrada Courts public  housing project, collecting money from his neighbors so he could attend a  housing conference in Washington. One tenant gave four pennies. Another kicked  in two quarters. In all, Gutierrez raised $627.    Gutierrez, a member of the Housing Authority Residents Advisory Committee,  returned from the conference three weeks ago with a message for his fellow  tenants: Beware that the Housing Authority could sell Estrada Courts in East  Los Angeles to a private developer just as it plans to do with the dilapidated  Jordan Downs public housing project in Watts.    On Tuesday, according to Gutierrez, Housing Authority officials summoned him to  the manager's office at Estrada Courts to rebuke him for going to Washington  and for appearing on two Spanish-language television stations in Los Angeles to  criticize the proposal to sell Jordan Downs. A housing official defended the  visit to Gutierrez, claiming the tenant needlessly frightened other project  dwellers.    Gutierrez, 44, a longtime resident of Estrada Courts, said Wednesday that he  was grilled during a 20-minute meeting with Leonard Karter, the agency's group  operations manager for Eastside projects, and Georgina Garcia, the manager of  Estrada Courts. Karter posed a series of questions on the trip to Washington  and on his television appearances, Gutierrez said.    "He started to interrogate me. 'What did I say in Washington? Who gave me  permission to talk to television? Why was I making people afraid?' " Gutierrez,  who speaks little English, said in Spanish.    Karter said Wednesday the thrust of the meeting was to assure Gutierrez that  Estrada Courts was not for sale. Karter denied that he inquired about the  Washington trip, but acknowledged asking about the television appearances,  including questions about Gutierrez's motivation and who initiated the  interview.    "We discussed the free speech thing," Karter said of the Tuesday meeting.  "Anybody can say what they wish but at the same time, he had a responsibility  not to alarm tenants."    The meeting occurred Tuesday afternoon -- the same day that Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky assailed the Housing Authority and its executive director, Leila  Gonzalez-Correa, for proposing a ban on public comment by the agency's  employees. Gonzalez-Correa has introduced a policy that would prevent employees  from writing or speaking to housing commissioners, City Council members,  government workers and reporters without the executive director's permission.    Yaroslavsky introduced a motion Wednesday recommending that the Housing  Authority Board of Commissioners reject the proposed policy and that  Gonzalez-Correa be required to appear before the City Council. The motion was  scheduled to be heard next week.    Gutierrez reported the meeting with Karter to David Etezadi, a Legal Aid  Foundation attorney who represents East Los Angeles tenants. Etezadi said he  was "outraged" by the incident and considers the actions by housing officials  "a violation of Gutierrez's rights." Etezadi pointed out that, a year ago, the  Housing Authority sent a police officer to question a tenant who had signed a  petition calling for Gonzalez-Correa's resignation.    "I think it is an intimidation tactic," Etezadi said. "Clearly, they are trying  to extend the gag order to residents."    Etezadi said Gutierrez called him Tuesday "very much upset" that he had been  reprimanded by the Housing Authority.    "Mr. Gutierrez has been working real closely with residents throughout the city  to oppose the sale of Jordan Downs," Etezadi said. "His fear as a tenant  representative stems back to a year ago when the executive director guaranteed  that the Housing Authority would never sell a development. He, as well as other  residents, feel incredibly betrayed. He has been quite active since the  announcement of the sale warning people that the same thing could happen in  their own developments."    On Wednesday, Gonzalez-Correa issued a bulletin advising tenants that the  Housing Authority had no plans to sell Estrada Courts, housing officials said.    Gutierrez, a factory worker who has been on welfare since he was laid off two  years ago, lives in a clean, well-kept five-bedroom apartment in Estrada Courts  with his wife and six children. A captain of his Neighborhood Watch program,  Gutierrez was elected two years ago by tenants at Estrada Courts as their  representative on the residents advisory committee. Since then, he has been a  relentless activist in organizing tenants at Estrada Courts to keep their  project clean and crime-free.    In news interviews that aired over the last week on television stations KMEX  Channel 34 and KVEA Channel 52, Gutierrez said he feared that Estrada Courts  may be put up for sale because tenants have spotted groups of Chinese investors  walking through the project on weekend mornings.    Gutierrez said he attended the National Convention of Urban Homesteading and  Resident Management conference in early March because he wanted to learn how  residents became owners and managers of public housing projects in Washington  and other cities. He hopes to begin a process this year for residents to take  over Estrada Courts.

headline:   ENCINITAS GENERAL PLAN STRICTLY LIMITS GROWTH   
text:   Culminating nearly two years of debate and scores of hearings, the Encinitas  City Council on Wednesday adopted the fledgling municipality's first general  plan, an ambitious blueprint for the future that includes strict limits on  growth.    The council approved the plan on a 4-1 vote, with Councilwoman Gail Hano  dissenting because of her opposition to the slow-growth provisions of the  document.    Mayor Anne Omsted said adoption of the plan marks "a milestone in city  history," but echoed Hano's concerns about the tough controls on growth.      200 Units Annually    Omsted expressed hope after the meeting that the council could work together in  the coming months to hammer out less restrictive slow-growth measures  acceptable to all factions in the city, which incorporated in 1986 on a wave of  anti-development sentiment.    Aside from dramatically reducing projected housing densities from the days of  county rule, the new general plan includes a cap on housing construction of  about 200 units annually and requires voter approval for significant changes in  land use or for density increases.    Taken in total, the density reductions would allow a population of 65,000 at  buildout, contrasted with an eventual population of 75,000 under the old county  land-use plans.    City officials say adoption of the plan represents a significant symbolic step  for Encinitas, the final act in throwing off the yoke of county rule.    "I almost feel choked up thinking of all the things we requested for so many  years, all of them finally being put into one general plan," Councilwoman  Marjorie Gaines said before the meeting.    Acting as a sort of municipal constitution, the plan embodies a wide range of  rules and standards for development, among them tighter grading restrictions,  tougher landscaping requirements, strict design reviews and regulations to  better protect environmentally sensitive areas.      Effort for Migrants    Although city officials were bullish on the new general plan, critics remained  to the end. In particular, advocates of more low-income housing for migrant  workers mounted a last-ditch effort to alter the plan.    During the past year, migrants camping out in the hills around Encinitas have  come under increasing pressure from local authorities eager to see them  uprooted.    Advocates for the immigrants argue that the city's new plan is a barrier to the  construction of affordable housing for those displaced from their simple homes  of scrap lumber and plastic sheeting in the squalid migrant encampments.    Officials with California Rural Legal Assistance, a group that aids the  impoverished migrants, wrote letters to the city and state in an effort to  argue their case.    "This plan is stunningly exclusionary," Claudia Smith, regional counsel for  California Rural Legal Assistance, said in an interview before the meeting. "It  makes Newport Beach look good. Encinitas officials don't want poor immigrant  workers in any way, shape or form, and this general plan is the proof in the  pudding."    Smith protested an effort by the city to get a one-year extension on Friday's  deadline for adopting the general plan. Under state law, cities have 30 months  after incorporation to approve a general plan, but Encinitas is seeking to  extend its deadline until next year to immunize its land-use plan from legal  challenges while authorities tinker with the document.      Considered Suing    Smith characterized the city's request as "a transparent attempt to foil  litigation for a year." Her group has considered suing the city because of  concerns about the plan's effect on low-income housing.    If the state grants the one-year extension, Smith said, the city should be  allowed to approve construction of large projects consisting of 10 or more  units only if 25% of the homes are set aside as affordable housing.    City Manager Warren Shafer agreed that the city wants the time extension as a  safeguard against litigation.    But he said officials are wary of legal challenges simply because the general  plan is still scheduled for review by the state Coastal Commission, which could  order changes in the document. Moreover, city planners will continue to work on  zoning provisions of the plan during the coming year. A lawsuit or two would  only complicate either process, Shafer said.    Although a suit over the migrant issue could loom, city officials contend that  their greatest concern is a legal challenge by developers.    "Basically, we're just trying to avoid unnecessary litigation and expense,"  Shafer said, noting that officials hope to have the city's plan before the  Coastal Commission for review in the next few months.

headline:   SCHOOLS AWAIT WORD ON TEST SCORE MISTAKES   
text:   Schools in San Diego County and throughout California will find out later this  week that their scores on a key statewide test of writing skills for  eighth-graders were computed erroneously for the spring of 1987, the first year  that the test was given.    The schools only last week learned their scores for the second year of the  writing test, given in the spring of 1988, and received comparisons between the  two years, which will now have to be refigured by state California Assessment  Program testing officials.    For the San Diego Unified School District, the revised scores will offer little  solace, as the results will still show that their students fall behind their  peers in other county districts and across the state in their ability to  organize their thoughts and write coherent essays on an assigned topic in a  45-minute test.    Some of San Diego's 22 junior highs and middle schools will find that they did  better in 1988 than in 1987, and others will learn they did not do as well as  they thought. But the trend in San Diego still points to shortcomings with the  district's writing programs, despite the increased emphasis on teaching writing  during the past two years.      Designed by UCSD Professor    "No one is going to applaud, even with the (revised) scores," Robert Raines, a  testing evaluator for the San Diego district, said Wednesday. "When all is said  and done, the bad news is still going to be that the district is below the  state on writing achievement, and that is not good enough for us."    The CAP writing test, designed by UC San Diego literature and writing professor  Charles Cooper, is the state's first to directly assess student writing ability  rather than evaluate it on the basis of responses to multiple-choice questions  on standardized tests.    Students are asked to write an original essay on topics in one of six areas of  writing -- including autobiography, evaluation and problem-solving -- with the  grading done by selected teachers from around the state.    Under CAP procedures, scores for individual students are not collected. Rather,  data is compiled for individual schools and for school districts to measure the  state's educational pulse each year and see whether state goals are being met  by educators.    The mistake happened because the consultants failed to take into consideration  the number of students at each school who took the test, state CAP official Pat  McCabe said.      Performances Dropped    No one noticed the discrepancy until scores for the spring 1988 test --  correctly calculated -- were received during the past couple of weeks, which  showed that most San Diego city schools dropped in performance between 1987 and  1988 -- or stayed about the same -- despite increased attention to writing in  the classroom.    Several principals called Raines to ask how their scores could have dropped, in  some cases quite dramatically.    One example of what has happened is at Memorial Junior High School. It had been  told there was a difference of only 1 point between its 1987 and 1988 scores.  This was a disappointment because the school is now a special magnet writing  academy in an effort to boost performance among its overwhelmingly Latino  student body and to attract Caucasian students.    Raines said that Memorial's revised 1987 score will now drop significantly,  meaning that its 1988 score will reflect considerable improvement.    But, despite expected comparison gains at some schools, most schools and the  district will report 1988 scores below the state average.    District administrators do not yet fully understand why their schools' writing  performance lags behind countywide and state averages. The district has  sponsored workshops for teachers to learn new techniques, participated in a  countywide writing project for secondary schools, and in general stressed the  need for more writing in all major academic areas.    UCSD's Cooper said questions asked of students taking the CAP tests show that,  no matter the socioeconomic base of a school, "where the emphasis is on writing  in all areas of teaching and where every teacher takes an interest in writing,  there are big gains.      'Strong Leadership'    "The research also supports the need to practice a lot of different kinds of  writings, that gains in literacy are connected to specific uses and that  teachers need to be encouraged to teach writing more carefully.    "In addition, a principal has to show strong leadership in encouraging  teachers."    At one of the district's bright spots -- Mann Middle School in East San Diego  -- its 1988 score is well above district and state averages, and its 1987 score  will probably be revised downward, meaning the school will be one of the few in  the district to make significant gains.    "It results from a concentrated effort spearheaded by our teachers," Mann  Principal Maruta Gardner said. "We devised a plan where each department, such  as math, took upon itself to emphasize two particular types of writing and we  did that throughout the year, not just during the testing period."    Almost a quarter of Mann's students are not yet proficient in English, and  about a quarter more, although fluent, are not native English speakers, making  the school's performance all the more remarkable.    "With our population, we knew we had to work hard at this, and not just tell  the kids that they should get a good night's sleep before the test and to eat  well. We decided last year that we needed to have a plan," Gardner said.    At Correia Junior High in Point Loma, the revised scores will mean less of a  drop between 1987 and 1988 than Principal Mike Lorch thought, although there  will still be a drop.    "It's very disappointing . . . and basically, instead of coming up with  explanations to gloss over and mitigate, we basically know that we are not  writing enough and not writing enough in a lot of areas. That's something I  want to sit down with my teachers and support committees and figure out why.

headline:   PRESIDENT OF REPUBLIC PICTURES;    NATHAN LEVINE; PIONEER IN MOVIES   
text:   Nathan (Nat) Levine, who parlayed a career as a distributor of early films that  were rejected by most of the major studios into the presidency of Republic  Pictures, is dead at age 89.    A spokeswoman for the Motion Picture and Television Hospital said Friday that  he died Sunday at the Woodland Hills facility.    Levine began in the industry in 1920 when he launched an independent  distributorship. Seven years later, still in his 20s, Levine formed his own  production company, Mascot.      First Sound Adventure Short    There he produced the first of what would be 500 reels of serials, including  what is believed to be the first sound adventure short, "King of the Congo."    Meanwhile, Herbert J. Yates, who owned Republic Film Laboratories and later  Consolidated Film Industries, was processing film for Mascot, Monogram, Liberty  and other small picture companies and knew that Mascot was one of the few  independent firms making money.    Levine was operating out of the old Mack Sennett studio in North Hollywood,  which he purchased when Sennett went bankrupt.    An additional attraction for Yates, who wanted his own studio, was that Mascot  held contracts for such young cowboy stars as Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette  and had used a former USC football player named John Wayne in three short  films.    In 1935, Yates formed Republic Pictures and Levine melded Mascot Pictures into  the Republic organization. Yates added modern recording equipment and the  latest in sound stages to Levine's holdings.    Levine also brought to Republic the sound recording engineers, writers,  cinematographers and special effects team that had made Mascot successful.      Head of Firm    After some disputes with Yates' original management team, Levine became head of  the firm, bringing to the new studio his expertise in low-budget, commercially  successful "B" features and long-running adventure serials. That twin package  remained the backbone of Republic until it gradually quit production in the  late 1940s, the victim of expensive, color spectacular movies from competing  studios and the brash infant of television.    Ironically, CBS purchased the North Hollywood property in 1952 and renamed it  Television City.    By then Levine had been gone for years, retiring from the film industry in  1937. His survivors include a son.

headline:   WILLIAM PRATER; JAILED FOR LIFE IN UNIONIST'S MURDER   
text:   William Jackson Prater, a former United Mine Workers official who was serving a  life term in prison for his role in the 1969 slayings of union dissident Joseph  (Jock) Yablonski and his family, died in his cell Friday, officials said.    Prater was found early in the morning at the State Correctional Institution at  Dallas in Luzerne County. A prison spokesman said Prater, who was 70,  apparently died of natural causes.    "He had been in poor health for some time," Roy VanWhy said. Prater had been  confined to a wheelchair since suffering a stroke in 1983.    Prater was sentenced in 1973 and was serving three life sentences for the  murders.    Yablonski, 59, was shot to death along with his wife, Margaret, 57, and their  25-year-old daughter, Charlotte, at their Clarksville home in southwestern  Pennsylvania on New Year's Eve, 1969. Yablonski had lost an election for UMW  president earlier that December.    His opponent, then-incumbent UMW President W. A. (Tony) Boyle, was later  convicted of ordering the assassination. Boyle's first conviction was  overturned and he was convicted a second time. He died in May, 1985, while  serving three life terms.    Prater, formerly of LaFollette, Tenn., was a mid-level union official accused  of helping to plan the killing and accumulating $20,000 in union funds to pay  the assassins. He later helped prosecutors convict Boyle.    The three men accused of carrying out the killings, Aubran (Buddy) Martin,  Claude Vealey and Paul Gilly, were all convicted and sentenced to life in  prison.    Prater served 16 years in a federal prison before being paroled, but then was  transferred to the state prison at Pittsburgh in September, 1988, to serve life  terms imposed under state law and was moved to Dallas later that year.

headline:   SHIITE BOMBER'S DREAM WAS TO KILL AUTHOR RUSHDIE   
text:   The Shiite Muslim suicide bomber who wounded five Israeli soldiers in south  Lebanon said in a videotape released Friday his dream had been to kill British  author Salman Rushdie.    "I wish I had executed the death sentence of the hypocrite agent Salman  Rushdie, fulfilling the edict of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but God  graced me with the operation against Israel," said Sheik Assad Birro in his  videotaped final testament.    Khomeini died in June four months after ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie for  blaspheming Islam in his novel, "The Satanic Verses." Several pro-Iranian  groups in Lebanon said they would carry out the command.    Birro, who died in the attack, urged "all strugglers" to find out where Rushdie  was and kill him. The author has been hiding since Khomeini's edict, which  caused outrage in the West and led to the breaking of diplomatic ties between  Britain and Iran.      Truck With Explosives    The videotape was distributed by Hezbollah (Party of God), which claimed  responsibility for Wednesday's attack in which Birro drove a truck rigged with  explosives into an Israeli army convoy patrolling a buffer zone in southern  Lebanon.    Hezbollah said the attack was to avenge Israel's abduction of a prominent  pro-Iranian cleric, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, from his home in southern Lebanon  on July 28.

Heep was one of the Dodgers' leading hitters in spring training last year, but  when the bell rang, Tommy Lasorda benched him.

When Lasorda's beloved .200 hitters recovered from injuries, he benched Heep  again and counted the minutes until Heep would be released at the end of the  season.    The moral is clear: Lasorda has patience galore with .200 hitters, but if you  hit .350 it's so long, farewell, goodby.    H. ANTHONY MEDLEY    Marina del Rey

headline:   PLAYERS OF TODAY ARE PENNY-WISE, NOT WIMPY   
text:   Mike Downey left out a very important fact in his Aug. 8 column.    He is right in saying that today's players are in better shape than those of  the 1940s and '50s. And he is also right in saying that the players of  yesterday played everyday, even when they had broken hip bones.    But he left out was the reason. Today's players receive their million-dollar  contracts on their statistics at the end of the year. That's all the cheap  owners look at today. So if a player hits .300, but in only 100 games, he is  considered a better asset than a player who would have hit .300, but instead  opted to play hurt, thus his average dropped to .265.    I don't blame today's players. I wouldn't play either. It's bad enough to play  hurt, and risk further injury, but it's even worse if the effort is not  appreciated.

headline:   AL MARTINEZ: TEARS AND TAXES   
text:   The white woman with an office in Brentwood and a $1.5-million home in the  south of France was in tears.    The black man with a business in South-Central L.A. and a lifetime of hard work  behind him was in a rage.    "They're driving me crazy," the woman said, wiping her eyes.    "I've worked like hell for what I have and I want to keep it," the man said,  trying to control his anger.    The woman has spent $190,000 in legal fees trying to straighten out a mess that  probably shouldn't have existed in the first place.    The man has paid a bill twice that he probably shouldn't have had to pay the  second time and is still being harassed for payment.    Welcome to the Wonderful World of an IRS Audit.    Anyone who has ever had his taxes audited knows it's a lousy place to be.    Mere receipt of the letter evokes images of criminal charges, federal prison,  homosexual rape, an escape attempt, a shoot-out, capture and additional time  behind bars, plus interest and penalties.    Add to that imaginary scenario years of harassment and confusion and you have  the reality of what has befallen two people I write about today.    Their names are Linda Peck and Nathaniel Mullins.    I mention their colors and their economic positions only to acknowledge that  the Internal Revenue Service is anything but racist or class-conscious in its  seek-and-destroy missions. Any target will do.    Both Peck and Mullins were audited in 1984. Peck, 50, the divorced wife of  wealthy builder Clair Peck, was in France when notified by the IRS. Mullins was  working in his real estate office on West Florence Avenue.    Far from poor, Peck was living off a $2-million divorce settlement. She also  once owned a flower shop and was abroad in '84 researching a television  project.    "I thought 'no big deal,' " she said when notified of the audit. "I had 40  boxes full of records and told my bookkeeper to give them what they wanted."    Mullins, 68, has been a real estate broker for 30 years and describes himself  as "a hard-working, middle-class person." He was told right off that he owed  $65,000 for a five-year period, which included the year 1978.    He sighed, blamed an incompetent ex-bookkeeper, mortgaged his home and paid the  $65,000 in full. That's what a good citizen does.    Three years later, the IRS thanked him by saying he owed $5,000 for 1978.    Mullins explained that he had already paid what he owed for '78, and an IRS  accountant said all right, in that case the government would settle for $2,800.    Mullins argued but finally paid the $2,800 to get them off his back, and was  assured that he was even with the board.    He had hardly finished sighing with relief when the IRS said greetings, you owe  $1,600 for 1978.    Meanwhile, the agency was demanding more and more documentation from Linda  Peck. She returned from France, prepared volumes of material for them and was  so effective that the auditor found a $25,000 error in her favor.    She was sent a refund check, which she promptly returned toward her next year's  taxes, which the IRS promptly lost. This caused more confusion and, for a time,  the threat of attaching her bank account.    About now, the first auditor disappeared and a new auditor assumed his duties.  Everything started all over. Mounds of documents became mountains, months  became years.    "I never have found out what they want," Peck said in a Brentwood office she  leases for $1,700 a month just to handle the audit.    "I took the auditor to lunch twice, hoping he'd reach some sort of conclusion,  but he hasn't. I'd move in with him if I thought it would help."    Even high-priced lawyers in L.A. and Houston have been unable to determine  precisely what the problem is, if any.    "If they'd issue a legitimate tax bill," Peck said, sobbing, "I'd pay it and  get on with my life. I can't even protest, because they won't tell me how much  they want!"    U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and two congressmen have contacted the IRS on Peck's  behalf and she is hopeful that their muscle will bring her nightmare to an end.    Mullins, meanwhile, went to the Problem Resolution Department of the IRS, and  they said they'd take care of it. They did. The $1,600 Mullins doesn't owe has  grown to $3,029 with interest and penalties.    But just last Thursday, someone from the Tax Collection Department called to  say they were working on his case.    With a little luck, that shouldn't cost him much more than another few thousand  dollars, plus his home, his car and his sanity.

headline:   LIFE AND THE LAW   
text:   The battle being waged in a Tennessee courtroom over the fate of seven frozen  and fertilized ova could gear up to be a national sensation along the lines of  the "Baby M" surrogate mother case two years ago. Like the Baby M case, this  dispute raises controversial questions concerning reproductive rights. And like  the Baby M case, this dispute is unlikely to solve any of them.    Mary Sue Davis and her former husband, Junior Lewis Davis, wanted to have a  child. Because Mrs. Davis could not conceive normally, the couple opted for in  vitro fertilization -- so-called test-tube fertilization -- where egg and sperm  are united in a laboratory and surgically implanted in the woman's uterus. Part  of the way through this process, after fertilization and before implantation of  seven of the fertilized eggs, the marriage fell apart and the couple decided to  divorce. Mrs. Davis now wants to gain possession of the embryos, hoping to use  them to have a child in the future. Mr. Davis doesn't want her to bear his  children without his consent.    The case raises many larger questions: Does Mr. Davis have the same rights over  the embryos as Mrs. Davis because their genetic contribution was equal? Or does  Mrs. Davis have greater rights because she can put the embryos to use and Mr.  Davis cannot? Or do the rights of the parents shrink in comparison to the  rights of the embryos who, as potential human beings, have been accorded full  legal status in some states?    The judge, who has said repeatedly that this case has no direct legal  precedents, has several avenues of response. One is to consider the case as a  standard divorce case and the embryos as any other piece of marital property.  Another would be to follow the reasoning of a California appellate court that  ruled last year that persons who give biological material to medical  institutions retain rights over that material. In that case, Mr. Davis would  retain at least equal right over the embryos. Finally, the judge could turn to  law concerning custody of children in divorce cases, determining what decision  would be in the "best interests" of the Davises' potential children.    The answers to such questions have enormous implications for reproductive  ethics. Should the judge decide that the well-being of the embryos supersedes  the claims of both adults, that would raise questions about the morality of  abortion. If the father is granted some say in the fate of the embryos, then  that would raise larger issues about paternal consent for abortion and the  rights of sperm donors. If the mother is accorded full powers over the embryos,  the ruling would raise questions about fathers' parental rights.    But although this case raises such sweeping questions, it is unlikely to  resolve them. In the Baby M case, the judge resorted to straight contract law  to make his ruling. Similarly, the Davises are likely to reach a satisfactory  legal solution that sidesteps the moral issues -- Mr. Davis could relinquish  all future rights or responsibilities over any children born from the embryos,  for instance, and Mrs. Davis would gain control over the embryos in return for  giving up the right to ask her former husband for child support.    As long as the judge does not grant the embryos legal status -- which would go  far beyond existing law -- this case will be just one more dispute that spurs  public debate and reveals how deep are society's uncertainties about  reproduction in this technologically confused era. The answers to the larger  questions will come about only after long deliberation -- not by one nervous  judge in one Tennessee courtroom but by society as a whole.

It is a  verifiable fact that department chairs get a considerable stipend for every  part-timer who teaches, presumably because of the paper work involved in  scheduling classes.    Therefore, when a large department has three times as many part-timers as  full-time teachers, the chair of that department is making (not earning) a nice  addition to the base salary.    As always, these inequitable matters seem to come down to a matter of  economics.    MARGIE REMAR    Van Nuys

headline:   BRADLEY'S FIGHT FOR POLITICAL SURVIVAL   
text:   The recent discoveries concerning Mayor Bradley's dealings with the Far East  Bank should be of great concern to the residents of Los Angeles (Part I, July  26-29). Reports of rigged bidding, huge campaign contributions, whiteout of  incriminating evidence in public records, and payments for consulting services  while he was being paid to be a full-time mayor of Los Angeles are deeply  troubling. Many of us are greatly troubled by the mayor's lack of candor and  credibility. His silence in the face of an avalanche of criticism and  accusations regarding improper dealings is disquieting.    Some residents have been at odds with the mayor over the extent and degree of  development that should be allowed in this city. They are unhappy with his  pro-growth stance and support of rail lines through residential communities.  While some people may disagree on these matters, they fully expected that he  would deal with city affairs fairly and objectively and judge them on their  merits.    Now, recent disclosures at council hearings make it clear that Bradley favors  special interests at the expense of the public good. Because of these  revelations, I believe his credibility has been damaged to the point where he  can no longer lead this city effectively.    I, with the concurrence of the board of directors of Homeowners of Encino, am  therefore calling upon Bradley to resign as mayor. I respectfully ask that he  step aside and allow someone else to give guidance and direction to this city.    GERALD A. SILVER    Encino     Silver is president of Homeowners of Encino.

text:   Thank you for Gordon's article.    I am a part-time teacher at a local community college. I am limited to nine  hours of teaching per week at any one college; if I had more class time, the  college would be obliged to give me benefits. Heaven forbid!    I am single and pay no rent because I live in my grandmother's house.  Therefore, I am able to live on my teaching income as long as financial  emergencies don't arise. Many of my teaching colleagues, however, can only  survive economically by becoming "freeway flyers," who spend lots of time  traveling between teaching jobs.    I appreciate that, in some cases, part-time jobs might be good for some  teachers who have full-time jobs elsewhere, who are full-time university  students, or who have a spouse who works full time. However, many of us depend  on our part-time teaching as our main source of income.    For myself, I could live with the inequity in pay and the absence of job  security, but I would desperately like to be eligible for group medical  insurance. I think it is inexcusable that part-time teachers do not have access  to a group medical insurance plan.    JAN A. COPELAND    Long Beach

But I should point out that The Times' list of city-provided benefits, which  included the use of a rent-free municipal mansion in Hancock Park, omitted the  "possessory" tax paid directly by the mayor.    Since the 1850s, California has had a law that requires someone benefiting from  the use of public property while not actually owning it to pay a possessory  tax, which is assessed by my office.    Last year, the mayor was sent, and paid, a $1,077.44 possessory interest bill  in lieu of a property tax. We have about 10,000 possessory assessments in  effect throughout the county.    JOHN J.

headline:   TRIAL ORDERED IN SLAYING OF 2 STUDIO GUARDS   
text:   A former mental patient was ordered Friday to stand trial in the slayings of  two Universal Studios guards he reportedly said God told him to kill.    Los Angeles Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper ordered Nathan N. Trupp, 42, to stand  trial after a one-hour preliminary hearing in which a security guard and a  sheriff's deputy described the Dec. 1 shootings and recounted Trupp's  explanation.    Soper ordered Trupp to be arraigned Thursday on charges that he killed Jeren  Beeks, 27, of La Crescenta and Armando Torres, 18, of Los Angeles after they  had turned him away from Universal Studios.    Trupp is also accused in the slayings of three people in a bagel shop near  where he lived in Albuquerque, N. M., two days before the Universal Studios  killings. The Los Angeles case will proceed first.    Authorities said Trupp opened fire on the guards at Universal's main gate  shortly after they turned him away when he asked to see actor Michael Landon.    Abelardo Solarez, another guard, testified Friday that he saw Trupp pacing  Lankershim Boulevard near the studio entrance. Then Trupp casually approached  the two guards, pulled a gun and opened fire without breaking stride, Solarez  said. The guard said Trupp shot Beeks three times and Torres once before  walking back to Lankershim, then west on Bluffside Drive.      Fired a Shot    Solarez said he began following Trupp but then saw a sheriff's car, which he  flagged down. Deputy James Campbell said he and Solarez followed Trupp a short  distance but when the deputy stopped the car to talk to Trupp, the suspect  fired a shot at him.    Campbell, unhurt, threw himself to the ground and shot Trupp in the side and  arm. Campbell and Solarez testified that as they waited for paramedics to  arrive, Trupp repeatedly talked of the shooting and asked the guard and deputy  to kill him.    "He kept saying that someone sent him to kill the two guards," Solarez said. "I  asked him who it was and he said, 'God.'    "He wanted us to finish him off because he was in pain. He said, 'Kill me, kill  me, it hurts.' He was crying at the time."    Authorities said Trupp was under the delusion that the victims killed in  Albuquerque, the two guards and Landon -- star of the TV series "Highway to  Heaven" -- all were Nazis conspiring against him.    Trupp, who was treated at a New Jersey mental institution in 1988 and at a  Maryland institution in the early 1970s, was originally ruled mentally  incompetent to stand trial. However, in June a Superior Court judge held that  treatment with drugs and therapy had restored his competency.    In court Friday, Trupp sat calmly, handcuffed to a chair, and did not speak.

headline:   DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN DIES IN 2-CAR CRASH NEAR PALMDALE   
text:   A Hawthorne woman was killed just outside Palmdale when her car veered across  the median of the Antelope Valley Freeway and was struck by an oncoming car  carrying a mother and her two children, the California Highway Patrol said  Friday.    Susie E. Carper, 43, who was not wearing a seat belt, died at the scene early  Thursday, CHP Officer Scott McKnight said. The occupants of the other car  escaped serious injury because the mother wore a seat belt and her daughters  were in back-seat child restraints, he said.    Nancy E. Jones, 30, of Palmdale suffered facial cuts and was taken by ambulance  to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, along with daughters Jillian, 18 months,  and Jaycie, 4 months, McKnight said. All three were expected to be treated and  released, the officer said.    Investigators had discovered no cause for the 7:45 a.m. crash, which occurred  in unincorporated county territory south of Palmdale.    Carper was headed north on the freeway toward Palmdale when her car drifted  across the freeway's gravel median area and was struck on the driver's side by  Jones' vehicle, McKnight said. Jones saw the oncoming car and braked but could  not avoid the collision, he said.

headline:   DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN HIT-AND-RUN CASE   
text:   A Canoga Park man pleaded guilty Friday to felony hit-and-run driving in a  bizarre incident in which another hit-and-run driver who fled on foot from a  minor traffic collision was killed.    A more serious charge of vehicular manslaughter against Darius B. Smith, 32,  was dropped in return for his guilty plea to the hit-and-run charge.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann M. Korban said prosecutors agreed to the plea bargain  because they were uncertain that they could secure a manslaughter conviction.    Smith faces up to two years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 22 in Van Nuys  Superior Court, Korban said.    Smith pleaded guilty in connection with the June 24 death of Saul C. Jimenez,  29, of Woodland Hills. Police said the occupants of a car involved in a minor  traffic accident caused by Jimenez had chased him and were wrestling with him  when he broke away.

headline:   DODGERS PROVIDE WARMTH;    BUT THEY PRODUCE LITTLE ELSE IN 10-2 LOSS AT CANDLESTICK   
text:   They usually hate the Dodgers here. The Candlestick Park fans like to heckle  them, jeer them and fight with security guards in an attempt to pour  inexpensive beverages on them.    Friday night, they loved them. And that should tell you all you need to know.    A bundled-up crowd of 33,307 howled with delight through a series of misplayed  fly balls, pop-ups, grounders and pitches as the Giants pounded the Dodgers,  10-2.    It was a night as chilly and bleak as the thought of the Dodgers needing 46  games to finish this season. In clearly establishing the difference between a  contender and a guy just looking for a place to get warm, the National League  West-leading Giants stretched their lead over Houston to four games. The  Dodgers, meanwhile, remained in fifth place, now 13 games behind.    The Dodgers needed to sweep this three-game series to have a chance at pennant  contention. So much for that idea. If one game can symbolize the end of a world  champion's reign, this was it.    "I said before, the only chance we had to stay in the race was to sweep these  guys," Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher said. "It doesn't look good."    Through 20 hits and 33 players, the game boiled down to two confrontations  between Belcher and Giant third baseman Matt Williams.    Williams finished with two homers and a single-game high for his career of six  runs batted in. Belcher finished 8-11 with a 3.51 earned-run average.    "He won both of them," Belcher said. "Simple as that."    In the first inning, with the bases loaded, Williams hit a 2-and-2 fastball  over the left-field fence for his second grand slam of the season. It was also  the second grand slam that Belcher has surrendered this season.    "There is no worse feeling in baseball than to give up a grand slam in the  first inning in Candlestick Park . . . in a Dodger uniform," Belcher said.  "I've never heard it so loud here. They were going nuts. I just wanted to get  the ball and pitch to the next hitter as soon as I could to shut them up."    Not so fast. Two innings later, with a runner on first base due to a Jeff  Hamilton error, Williams hit an 0-and-1 Belcher fastball even deeper to left  field for a two-run homer. It gave the Giants a 6-1 lead, and after that, many  fans never stopped hooting.    "It's a big rivalry here, but the interesting thing is, it's not between us and  the Dodgers," Williams said. "It's between our fans and the Dodgers. I don't  know how many fights I see in the stands, just people all riled up. I know for  a pitcher it must be tough."    Williams, 23, has three home runs against the Dodgers this year, and three  homers in his last four at-bats, with eight homers overall. That's not bad  considering that he has batted only 122 times this year after spending most of  the season at triple-A Phoenix because he couldn't hit the curveball.    Belcher thinks that this kid who may have finally entrenched himself as the  Giants' third baseman still might not be able to hit a curveball. But Friday  that was irrelevant.    "Both times, the situation called for a fastball, and he's a dead fastball  hitter," Belcher said. "As good as he looks in one night like tonight, he can  look bad for an entire week, because he hasn't quite learned to hit the  breaking ball."    So why throw him a fastball, ever? "Because I'm a dead fastball pitcher,"  Belcher said. "I got to think I can throw it harder than he can hit it.  Tonight, I got it in bad locations both times. And he can hit the ball harder  than Kevin Mitchell (who also homered for the Giants), Darryl Strawberry, any  of those guys."    Said Williams: "It's a compliment when he says I can hit it that hard. Because  that's all I try to do. Hit it hard."    Belcher departed four batters after Williams' second homer, but not before he  had loaded the bases. He had allowed a single on a pop-up that dropped between  shortstop Alfredo Griffin and second baseman Lenny Harris. After a ground-ball  single off his foot, Belcher walked Giant starter and winner Mike LaCoss.    Reliever Tim Crews came in but wasn't much help. The first batter he faced,  Brett Butler, hit a two-run single. His fourth batter, Mitchell, hit a two-run  homer in the next inning, giving him 37 homers and 102 RBIs. Will Clark had  preceded Mitchell with a fly ball that center fielder Jose Gonzalez lost in the  wind, the ball falling at the base of the fence for a double.    Belcher, who gave up eight runs (five earned) in 2 2/3 innings, has had longer  outings as a relief pitcher. It was his shortest start since he lasted 2 1/3  innings on opening day in Cincinnati. He has given up four homers in his last  six innings of work, and 15 homers overall this year. That figure is nearly  twice the number yielded by Orel Hershiser (eight).    The Dodgers scored their runs on Griffin's RBI single in the third inning and  Gonzalez's RBI single in the fourth. But the story of their offense was what  could have happened but didn't.    In the fifth inning, after pinch-hitter Billy Bean led off with a single,  Harris moved him to second with a single. Griffin then singled to load the  bases with none out.    Franklin Stubbs, who entered the game with a .351 average in his 19 starts this  season, stepped up while Dodgers on the bench moved to the edge of their seats.  But he hit the first pitch directly to LaCoss. The pitcher threw home for one  out, and catcher Terry Kennedy threw to first base to complete the double play.  Mike Marshall struck out looking to end the inning.    Dodger Notes    Arthroscopic surgery Friday revealed cartilage fragments in the right knee of  Kal Daniels. The fragments are similar to those found in Mike Davis' knee last  month. The fragments were removed by Dr. Frank Jobe, and Daniels will join the  team in Philadelphia to begin rehabilitation. He probably is out for the  season. . . . Davis, out since July 6 after surgery on both knees, could be  swinging at live pitching this weekend for the first time since the operation.  He is accompanying the team on its' current 12-game trip and could be ready for  action by September. . . . Kirk Gibson's knee surgery has been postponed from  Tuesday to Aug. 29, so Gibson's Detroit physician, Dr. Robert Tiehgie, can  assist Jobe. Gibson did not accompany the team. . . . Catcher Rick Dempsey is  trying something different to end his batting slump -- glasses. "I don't really  need them, but they make things just a little clearer at night," said Dempsey,  39, who several years ago tested but discarded contact lenses. "Who knows,  maybe they'll help me get a hit." Dempsey entered Friday in an 0-for-17 slump  that had dropped his average to .146. . . . Injured Giant pitcher Rick  Reuschel, on the disabled list because of a strained right groin muscle, threw  on the side Friday and experienced no pain. Look for him to return to the Giant  rotation by the middle of next week. If Kelly Downs has a successful start  Sunday in his return from a shoulder injury, the depleted Giant staff could  suddenly have seven starters: Dave Dravecky, Scott Garrelts, Mike LaCoss, Bob  Knepper, Don Robinson, Reuschel and Downs. . . . A day after Dravecky defeated  Cincinnati, 4-3, in his successful return from cancer surgery on his left arm,  he said the arm felt fine. "There is just the normal stiffness, nothing more,"  said Dravecky, who said he spent Thursday night in a quiet celebration at the  apartment of teammate Atlee Hammaker. "I had to get away from the 25 messages  on my answering machine," Dravecky said.

headline:   MORNING BRIEFING: BULLPEN IS BAFFLED BY THROWIN' VOICE   
text:   Baseball players apparently never run out of ways to have fun at the expense of  their teammates. Yankee relief pitcher Dave Righetti told the New York Times:    "Our bullpen is right under the bleachers, and we hear a lot of stuff from  fans. In the last two years, Charlie Hudson would come out there and hide  behind a pillar, disguise his voice and act like a fan. He'd ride us, give us  the Bronx cheer, the whole works.    "Scott Nielsen went for a month thinking it was the real thing. I don't think  Neil Allen ever found out."    Trivia time: Who pitched the first no-hitter in Dodger Stadium?    Sweet dreams: Andre Rison, Indianapolis Colts receiver from Michigan State, on  his $890,000 signing bonus, half of which is deferred: "My money is sleeping. I  hope when it wakes up, there's more of it."    Slim-and-none Dept.: Indicating that Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor never  had a chance of signing Danny Ferry, Ailene Voisin of the Atlanta Journal  wrote:    "Former Clipper Coach Gene Shue, who was fired last Jan. 18, is Danny Ferry's  godfather and a close friend of the family. During his 20 months with the  organization, Shue tangled frequently with Baylor regarding personnel and  coaching matters."    Accursed one: Headline in the Seattle Times after Bert Blyleven of the Angels  had pitched a shutout against the Seattle Mariners in the Kingdome:  "Blankety-blank Blyleven."    Fickle fates: Writes Russ White of the Orlando Sentinel, indicating all has not  gone well for the 1969 Miracle Mets:    "Donn Clendenon, who gained a law degree after his playing career, pleaded  guilty to a charge of cocaine possession last year in Sioux Falls, S.D. Catcher  Jerry Grote served time in jail for cattle sale fraud. Left fielder Cleon Jones  received a suspended sentence for forging checks. Reliever Jack DiLauro joined  a California commune in 1970 and hasn't been heard from since."    White said 14 of the 25 players have been divorced, two of them twice.    Straight arrow: How straight is Mike Reid off the tee? Writes Gordon S. White  Jr. of the New York Times: "Usually, you do not ask Reid how many fairways he  missed. You ask him how many water sprinkler lines he missed."    'Fessing up: As he goes into his fifth year as a CBS football analyst, Terry  Bradshaw told the Houston Chronicle, "I should've been canned right off the  bat, but I was given a chance. I've cut out all the silliness; there's only one  John Madden."    Heat treatment: Boston's Mike Boddicker, asked his secret after he had reeled  off five straight victories with a 0.78 earned-run average, said: "More  fastballs. You'd be surprised how many fastballs right down the middle hitters  miss."    Trivia answer: Bo Belinsky of the Los Angeles Angels. On May 5, 1962, he did it  to Baltimore, 2-0.    Quotebook: George Brett of Kansas City, on the 17-5 loss to Cleveland while Bo  Jackson was sidelined: "I knew we were in trouble because our only player who  could score touchdowns was on the bench, and we didn't have time to kick four  field goals."

headline:   WEEKEND RACING AT DEL MAR;    A NO-STAR FIELD FOR THE EDDIE READ   
text:   Even Eddie Read might have had trouble selling the 1989 version of the race  that bears his name.    Sunday's $250,000 Eddie Read Handicap, named for the late Del Mar public  relations director, is woefully short of stars for its 16th running at 1 1/8  miles on the turf, even though four of the contenders have won Grade I races.    It is a surprising turn of events, because the middle-distance grass division  in California has been one of the strongest in recent years. In fact, the last  four winners of the Read -- Deputy Governor, Sharrood, Al Mamoon and Tsunami  Slew -- were of world-class quality and helped boost the race to Grade I  status.    With division leaders Peace and Steinlen absent -- along with Frankly Perfect,  Nasr el Arab and Great Communicator, all pointing for the Arlington Million --  this edition of the Read shapes up as a showdown between Silver Circus, the  1988 Del Mar Derby winner, and Mister Wonderful II, winner of the American  Handicap at Hollywood Park July 4. Silver Circus will carry top weight of only  118 pounds, giving Mister Wonderful II a pound.    Richard Mandella trains the English-bred Mister Wonderful II for Santa Monica  car dealer Steven Taub. The American Handicap marked the first U.S. stakes  victory in 10 starts for the 6-year-old son of Mummy's Pet.    Mandella, who is having his finest season, took over the training of Mister  Wonderful II in January. His first challenge was an injured hoof.    "He was just getting over a quarter crack when he came to us," said Mandella.  "They had to cut out a pretty good chunk, and it took some time to grow back."    Mandella decided to bring Mister Wonderful II back to the races in a  six-furlong Breeders' Cup-sponsored event on the Hollywood Park turf course  June 25, even though the horse had not sprinted since he was a 3-year-old in  England. Mister Wonderful II finished a fast-closing third, then trotted back  to be unsaddled, bleeding profusely from the mouth.    "He bit his tongue," Mandella said. "Not bad but, boy, was there a lot of  blood. He probably didn't even notice it until the race was over."    In the American Handicap eight days later, Mister Wonderful II won at odds of  10-1, beating Steinlen by a nose at 1 1/8 miles. Pranke, who won the Sunset  Handicap in his next appearance, finished a close third.    "We weren't surprised he won," Mandella noted. "He'd shown us his quality  already. We were a little surprised that he came around so fast, though."    Besides Mister Wonderful II and Silver Circus, the Eddie Read field features  Saratoga Passage, The Medic, Pasakos, Skip Out Front, Halcyon Days and Quiet  Boy.    Mandella has a solid shot to sweep Del Mar's Sunday stakes doubleheader. He  will be sending out Robert Folsom's 3-year-old filly, Reluctant Guest, in the  supporting feature, the $100,000 San Clemente Handicap at one mile on the  grass.    Horse Racing Notes    In the $83,650 Escondido Handicap at 1 3/8 miles today, Charlie Whittingham  will run Bruce McNall's filly, Raintree Renegade, against Danishgar, Loyal  Double, Brisque, Blade of the Ball, Foolhearty, Wallotton, Putting, Dance Card  Filled and Pleasant Variety. . . . The top stable for 2-year-olds this summer  belongs to trainer Brian Mayberry and his prime patrons, Jan, Mace and Samantha  Siegel. On Wednesday at Del Mar, their Barachois colt, Doyouseewhatisee, won  the six-furlong De Anza Stakes by three lengths. It was the Siegels' fourth  local juvenile winner, and they have had three more in Florida running in Jan's  name. . . . It has been raining off and on in Chicago, and that is fine with  Thad Ackel, who will send out Great Communicator against Blushing John today in  the Arlington Handicap, a prep for the Arlington Million Sept. 3. "He doesn't  have to necessarily win to please me," said Ackel. "But he's got to come away  from there running and keep on going." . . . Bedouin, one of the most popular  claimers ever to run in Southern California, will be paraded after the second  race today at Del Mar. The gray 8-year-old won 14 of 67 starts and ran 15th in  the 1984 Kentucky Derby.

headline:   ALABAMA STAKES AT SARATOGA;    OPEN MIND TO SEEK HER 10TH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY   
text:   New Jersey might be first in tomatoes, gangland burials and beauty pageants,  but the state has never been known for the horses it has bred.    Regret, a bona fide Jersey-bred, became the first filly to win the Kentucky  Derby, but that was in 1915 and not many New Jersey-breds have distinguished  themselves since then.    Now, however, there's Open Mind, another 3-year-old filly who, after not  getting the chance to run in the Derby, has forged a record quite similar to  Regret's. Elected to the Hall of Fame here in 1957, Regret had a career that  included nine wins and one second-place finish in 11 starts. Open Mind takes a  13-race record of 11 wins and two seconds, including nine straight victories,  into today's 109th running of the Alabama Stakes.    Surprisingly, seven other fillies have entered the 1 1/4-mile Alabama,  including Lea Lucinda, a stablemate of Open Mind's. It was another stablemate,  Some Romance, who was the last horse to beat Open Mind, by a nose in the  Frizette at Belmont Park 10 months ago. Open Mind's other loss, by 4 1/2  lengths, came a month before the Frizette when she finished second to Ms. Gold  Pole in the Lassie at Laurel.    Today, Open Mind will be coupled in the betting with Lea Lucinda, because they  both race for trainer Wayne Lukas. The ownership is different, Open Mind  belonging to Gene Klein and Lea Lucinda being the property of Calumet Farm.    The Alabama draw gave the rail to Dearly Loved, with Jean Cruguet in the  saddle. Outside them, in order, come Rose Park with Raul Rojas; Naskra's  Return, Jose Santos; Open Mind, Angel Cordero; Lea Lucinda, Randy Romero;  Silent Classic, Eddie Maple; Nite of Fun, Chris Antley, and Dream Deal, Craig  Perret. As though Open Mind needs another advantage, she will carry 121 pounds,  the same as the others.    Open Mind was bred in New Jersey by Robert Brennan, through the mating of  Deputy Minister and Stage Luck, a Stage Door Johnny mare who was a minor stakes  winner and who produced one previous stakes winner. Deputy Minister, a grandson  of Northern Dancer, won the Eclipse Award as best 2-year-old colt in 1981, then  had his career ended by injury before he could run in the Kentucky Derby.    On behalf of Klein, Lukas bought Open Mind as a yearling for $150,000. A  victory today would increase the filly's earnings to almost $1.7 million.    "I had no idea she was a Jersey-bred when I bid on her," Lukas said. "The  important thing was that she looked like a race horse. Her name came from the  fact that I went into the sale with an open mind."    Klein, who became the third man to win the Derby with a filly, with Winning  Colors in 1988, also had an open mind about this year's Derby. But Lukas  dissuaded him from running Open Mind, and instead she was an easy winner of the  Kentucky Oaks, which is run for 3-year-old fillies the day before the Derby.  Partly because of her small size, Lukas didn't feel that Open Mind had a good  chance against Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, who ran 1-2 in the Derby.    Open Mind's career actually began against colts, and in New Jersey, where she  won a couple of races at Monmouth Park. After the two defeats, she began the  current winning streak with a 1 3/4-length victory in the Breeders' Cup  Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs and then, in case the voters had doubts,  she clinched the 2-year-old filly title with a victory two weeks later in the  Demoiselle at Aqueduct.    Open Mind won the Demoiselle by a neck. She usually wins more comfortably than  that, although in her last start, the Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont,  she needed intervention from the stewards to beat Nite of Fun, who finished  first by a nose after clobbering Lukas' filly in the stretch.    That victory made Open Mind the seventh filly to sweep the Acorn, the Mother  Goose and the Coaching Club. Open Mind's people make no apologies and don't  feel that she backed into the honor.    "We lost three lengths on the interference and only got beat six inches," says  Jeff Lukas, who handles the Saratoga operation for his father. "She was going  to win if she didn't have to alter course."    Nite of Fun was soundly beaten by Open Mind in the Mother Goose and the Acorn,  finishing 28 1/2 lengths behind Lukas' filly, but trainer Jimmy Toner is back  for more.    "I think my filly would have finished first in the Oaks if there had been no  bumping in the stretch," Toner said.    Besides winning, Open Mind has handled all kinds of courses. She has won three  times at Belmont, twice each at Monmouth, Gulfstream Park and Churchill Downs  and once at Aqueduct and Laurel. She has won over mud and before large crowds  -- more than 65,000 saw both the Kentucky Oaks and the Breeders' Cup.    And now she has a chance to add Saratoga to the list. It's the same track where  that other classy Jersey-bred, Regret, suffered one of her two career defeats.    Horse Racing Notes    Angel Cordero is shooting for his second straight victory in the Alabama. He  won with Maplejinsky last year. . . . Calumet won the Alabama with Our Mims in  1977 and she was later voted best 3-year-old filly. . . . Wayne Lukas won the  1984 Alabama with Life's Magic. . . . Dream Deal comes into the Alabama after  winning the Monmouth Oaks, the stake in which Naskra's Return ran fourth and  Lea Lucinda was seventh. . . . Shy Tom probably will join Clever Trevor and Le  Voyageur in facing Easy Goer next Saturday in the $1-million Travers. . . .  Shuvee and Mom's Command are the only horses to win both the New York triple  for fillies and the Alabama. . . . Adjudicating, a 2-year-old son of Danzig who  is undefeated in two New York races, makes his stakes debut for trainer Shug  McGaughey in the $200,000 Sapling at Monmouth Park today. With Cordero riding  Open Mind, Randy Romero takes over the mount. Julie Krone, the leading jockey  at Monmouth, will be riding Carson City for Lukas. On Thursday, Krone won her  first stake at Saratoga, the Yaddo with Sweet Blow Pop.

headline:   GOLF ROUNDUP;    SENIOR ROOKIE LEADS AT RANCHO MURIETA   
text:   John Paul Cain, a rookie on the Senior PGA Tour, shot a five-under-par 67  Friday to take a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the Rancho Murieta  Senior Gold Rush.    Ken Still was in second place at 68.    Ray Beallo, Bert Yancey, Phil Rodgers and Dave Hill shot 69s, and Al Geiberger,  Dan Morgan and Bob Erickson had 70s on the 6,674-yard Rancho Murieta Country  Club course.    Cain earned $45,000 when he won the Greater Grand Rapids Open last month.  Friday, the 53-year-old stockbroker from Houston made five birdies and said  that his victory, which earned him a one-year exemption, has allowed him to  relax and play his normal game.    "One of the hardest things about playing tournament golf is to be patient,"  Cain said. "The guys who have played out here for 30 years have learned that."    Still, who began his round on the 10th hole, was six under par after his first  eight holes. He was still six under par after a birdie on the sixth hole but  then bogeyed the next two holes to finish with a 68.    "I guess it's kind of like the fisherman who caught a 30-pounder and let it get  away," Still said, after playing his first nine holes in 31, only to shoot a 37  on the next nine.    Defending champion Bob Charles, the tour's second-leading money-winner so far  this year, shot a 73. Orville Moody, the leading money-winner with $382,768,  shot a 72. Moody won the Gold Rush in 1987.

headline:   EARLY TRAGEDY TOUCHED LETTER CARRIER'S LIFE;    TAYLOR'S FATHER, A HEAVY DRINKER, WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY DAUGHTER AFTER HE BEAT  HIS WIFE   
text:   John Merlin Taylor, the mail carrier who went on a shooting rampage Thursday at  the Orange Glen postal station, was touched by another tragedy more than 30  years ago -- the night his father reportedly came home drunk, beat the boy's  mother and then was shot to death by the boy's sister.    Taylor, who was on life-support systems Friday night at Palomar Medical Center  after being declared brain dead, was a teen-ager at the time his father was  killed in the mid-1950s, in the family's small farm home in central Missouri,  according to several longtime family acquaintances.    But what effect, if any, the earlier tragedy may have had on his decision  Thursday morning to shoot his wife, then kill two co-workers and wound a third  is uncertain. Two of Taylor's brothers and a sister declined to discuss the  incident Friday.      Looking for Clues to Motive    Meanwhile, his relatives and co-workers here suggested in stronger terms Friday  that the man who was described as a "model employee" was growing disillusioned  with his work, and that stress, rather than personal problems, might be to  blame for the Thursday morning bloodshed.    But Escondido Police Lt. Danny Starr said investigators may remain forever  baffled by Taylor's motive and may have to write it off as "a tragedy that  can't be explained."    Starr said Taylor, 52, may have believed that he was under investigation by  postal authorities for mail theft -- even though there was no such inquiry.    "One of his co-workers told one of our investigators that Taylor thought they  were trying to fire him for mail theft, but we checked with the Post Office,  and they said there absolutely was no such investigation," Starr said.    Starr said investigators continued Friday to talk to relatives and co-workers  -- and that, although all have offered speculation, there are no new leads.    "We're getting little bits and pieces of what people think might have been the  problem, but nothing has hit us in the face that would explain why he went off  the deep end," Starr said.    "Unfortunately, the person who could tell us is Taylor. . . . His close friends  or his wife might have been privy to something, but he took them with him.  That's made it tough for us."      Troubled First Marriage    Attention also focused on Taylor's alleged violent behavior against his former  wife, Mary, who divorced Taylor in 1977.    Documents filed in Vista Superior Court quoted Mary Taylor as saying she wanted  to end her marriage because her husband was "extraordinarily violent,  frequently drinks to excess, has threatened (her) life on many occasions and .  . . physically struck, battered and beat (her) to the ground."    But Ramon D. Asedo, the attorney who represented John Taylor in the divorce,  disputed the allegations of drinking and beating.    "There was no showing of physical violence," Asedo said Friday. "It was an  extremely quiet, placid and pleasant separation. There was no real drinking or  abuse, and that petition is just the kind of typical garbage we lawyers put in  there."      Father a Heavy Drinker    Taylor's father, a farmer and heavy-machine operator, was a heavy drinker and  wife abuser, according to several family acquaintances who live near the Taylor  hometown of Mokane, Mo.    "I've known the Taylor boys all my life. It's a big family," said James St.  George Tucker, past president of the Kingdom of Callaway Historical Society,  which serves Mokane.    "It was a respected family. Joe (the father) was good size, but he started  drinking. He started abusing his wife. And the daughter shot him and killed him  at the house."    The daughter, whose name was not known Friday, was exonerated in the shooting,  Tucker said, mainly because Joseph Taylor had a "long history of abuse and  drinking, of hitting his wife mainly, but the kids too."    "The court found her innocent," Tucker said.    Gene Maupin, the undertaker who buried Joseph Taylor, recalled that the killing  was the last thing the community expected, despite the rumors of alcohol and  wife abuse. "It was a large family and a well-known family, so it was a shock,"  he said.    Mokane Mayor Howard (Glen) Paul, who grew up down the block from the Taylors,  said the shooting "had an effect here, and everybody here remembers it."    It was not immediately known whether John Taylor was at home the night his  father was killed, and two brothers and a sister still living in the Mokane  area declined to talk about their brother or the shooting. But other sources in  Mokane recalled that, soon after his father's death, young John Taylor  graduated from high school and joined the Marine Corps in 1955. He later  settled in the San Diego area, the only member of his family to leave Missouri,  and joined the Postal Service in March, 1964.      Ex-Wife Declines Comment    On Friday, his previous wife, Mary Taylor, and her five children by that  marriage, declined comment. "We ask for your understanding, patience and  empathy at this very difficult time for our family," the family said in a  prepared statement that was read at Palomar Medical Center. Thursday's shooting  rampage began five blocks from Mary Taylor's home, where her former husband  shot his wife, Liesbeth, twice in the head as she lay in bed.    One of John Taylor's three stepchildren said Friday that the postal carrier had  been complaining increasingly about the aches and pains from his job.    "He was complaining about his back, his heels, his shoulder hurting," said Mike  McMullen, 22.    After killing his wife, Taylor, dressed in his postal uniform, then drove to  the Orange Glen postal station about half a mile away, where he shot and killed  two co-workers with whom he would share a cup of coffee and a smoke most  mornings before work at a loading-dock picnic table. Taylor then went inside  and wounded a third employee before shooting himself in the head.    Killed were Ron Williams, 56, of Escondido, and Richard Berni, 38, of San  Marcos. Paul DeRisi was shot in the arm, and a fourth co-worker was injured  when she fell while fleeing the building, in the 1700 block of East Valley  Parkway.    McMullen discounted suggestions by neighbors that his mother and stepfather  were experiencing marital difficulties. "They were very happy," said McMullen,  who lives nearby in Escondido. "They were going to be leaving soon for a  vacation back to Missouri to visit his (Taylor's) mom."    McMullen said his stepfather was able to put on a happy face at work, and  generally did not complain at home about his job but, nonetheless, said he was  growing weary of it. He said that he, his brother and his sister were  considering hiring an attorney, but declined to elaborate.      Postal Workers Return    Work at the post office on Friday returned to something close to normal, as  three psychologists mingled with employees -- and met privately with some --  who returned to work, only to face a backlog of undelivered mail.    "It's a somber attitude inside, but they seem to be working like they were  before the shooting," U.S. Postal Service spokesman Ken Boyd said.    Signs of Thursday morning's onslaught were covered up with white paint by the  time employees arrived for work Friday morning.    Boyd said that, of the 43 postal workers scheduled to work on Friday, two  carriers and four clerks called in sick, and another worker showed up for work  but then left. Workers from other stations were brought in to help with the  mail that had gone undelivered Thursday.    Throughout the city, mailboxes were adorned with yellow ribbons. One resident  erected a makeshift American flag at half-staff on his mailbox. At the post  office, several small bouquets were placed at the flagpole, and inside the  building, 300 helium-filled balloons -- donated by a local businessman -- added  an unusual splash of color.    Taylor's route on Friday was handled by one of his closest friends, Jonny Sims,  who said he was still at a loss to explain Taylor's outburst.      Heavy Mail Load Wednesday    "I know one thing -- that there was an awful lot of pressure at work, but it  never seemed to bother him," Sims said. "But Wednesday night he was bombarded  with so much mail it was unbelievable.    "I said before that I thought that maybe it was something at home that got to  him, but then why did he bring it to the post office?" Sims asked. "I can't  figure it, and I hate to play amateur psychologist."    Sims said Taylor was a homebody who regularly declined opportunities to go out  with co-workers after work. "He'd never go out with the guys," he said. "He  always wanted to go home, and he'd only go out with his wife. I always thought  that his wife was his best friend -- along with his children. They were his  life."    Both Sims and Taylor's stepson discounted notions that the shooting may have  been brought on by financial problems. "His wife was very frugal with money.  There were never any problems with her spending too much," Sims said. "Besides,  she had her own job and her own income. They kept it separate. He probably  never knew how much money she had -- and she probably never knew how much he  had. He wasn't cheap. If ever we had to pass the hat around for something, you  could always count on John putting in the most."    Danny McMullen, a 24-year-old stepson who lived with the couple, agreed that  his mother and stepfather had no money problems. "He didn't even want my mom to  work, but she chose to," he said.    Both Danny and Mike McMullen said Taylor did not drink, except for an  occasional beer. "I doubt you'd even find a beer in the refrigerator right  now," Danny McMullen said.      Stress on the Job    Edward Dunne, vice president of the postal union local in Escondido, dismissed  contentions that the shooting could be attributed solely to any personal  problems Taylor was having. Dunne also countered arguments by postal officials  that a recent series of suicides and shootings by postal employees are not the  result of high stress on the job.    "I really take exception to that," he said. "It may be true that something in  their personal life triggers it. But the very fact that they go to the post  office to do these terrible, tragic acts, where they take out other postal  employees or a supervisor, or take their own lives, makes a very powerful  statement.    "And that statement is that this job has produced a lot of my anxiety and a lot  of my problems and a lot of my stress. These people are saying to us before  they take their lives that maybe it's time to enter the 20th Century and  realize you can only push people so far," Dunne said. "People have different  stress levels and different breaking points."    U. S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said Friday that he had asked the House Post  Office and Civil Service Committee to open an inquiry into the recent series of  shootings and suicides and their relationship to work stress.    "I would hope there might be some recommendations on how to improve postal  operations and reduce the stress," he said.    But Mike Cannone, a spokesman at the main post office in San Diego, denied that  postal workers are under any more stress than other groups of workers.    "The stress issue has been brought up by a lot of individuals. But there's no  evidence this (Taylor shooting) is related to any postal stress," Cannone said.    "Secondly, people ask if there's stress in the post office. And our answer is  that we're not going to deny that. But not to the degree that would cause a  normal, level-headed person to do the kind of tragic things that were done" in  Escondido.    San Diego Postmaster Margaret Sellers, who spent much of Friday visiting  members of the victims' families, declined comment on the issue.    "She's pretty frustrated, and she's really got her hands full," said Cannone.    PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP -- For traumatized survivors of the killings, counseling is  quick to come. Page 1, Part II.

headline:   BENES IS BEATEN IN MAJOR DEBUT AS PADRES SPLIT   
text:   Andy Benes waited a lifetime for this opportunity Friday, wondering just what  it was like to step on that mound and pitch in his first major league game.    Oh, the NCAA tournament was nice. And the Olympics were a blast. But the big  leagues, man, that's been his dream ever since he could put a baseball in his  right hand.    "I'm pretty laid-back," Benes said, "but you think about it when you're in the  clubhouse, watching TV, and you say to yourself, 'God, what would it be like to  be out there?' "    Well, before he had a chance to contemplate his situation, there he was  standing on the mound, encircled by a crowd of 25,755 at San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium. His mother and two brothers were in the stands. His friends and former  college teammates were back in Evansville, Ind., watching on cable TV. His dad  was back home in Chicago, sitting in front of their living room TV set.    He knew this was the big-leagues when he found himself facing the superstars,  such as seven-time All-Star Dale Murphy. Oh, look, there's 42-year-old Darrell  Evans, who began playing professionally the year he was born. And there's  Lonnie Smith, the man who has three World Series championship rings.    So you can just imagine just how disillusioned he must have been after the  Padres' 6-5 loss in the first game of the doubleheader against the Atlanta  Braves. One of his teammates lost a ball in the sun to help trigger a four-run  inning, and the Padres' final rally was killed in the ninth when another was  tagged out at second on the hidden-ball trick.    Welcome to the big-leagues, kid.    The Padres wound up splitting the doubleheader, winning the second game, 2-0,  with Dennis Ramsussen (5-8) winning, and Mark Davis recording his major-league  leading 30th save. But the media mob attending the doubleheader, even including  a couple of reporters from Evansville, weren't there to interview Rasmussen,  talk to Jack Clark about his two-run homer in the second game or ask about Tony  Gwynn's four-hit game and six-for-eight doubleheader performance that raised  his average to .346.    No sirree, the focus centered squarely on Andrew Charles Benes, the man the  Padres paid $235,000 a year ago as the No. 1 pick in all of the land in the  June free agent draft.    Benes has also found himself in the center of controversy in the Padre  organization on just how to handle the kid. There was a quarrel whether he  belonged in the Padre major league spring-training camp this year instead of  the minor league camp. There was bickering over when Benes should be called up  from double-A Wichita. There was quibbling whether Benes should be called up to  the big-leagues now, after yielding an 8.10 ERA in five starts at Las Vegas,  including 41 hits in 26 2/3 innings.    But there he was on display Friday night, with the entire Padre front office on  hand, anxiously anticipating the unveiling of pitcher they believe one day will  be among the elite in the game.    The reviews from the Padre organization were quite favorable, but the bottom  line was that Benes pitched, well, like a 21-year-old kid making his  major-league debut.    Benes, 6-feet-6, 235 pounds, showed flashes, striking out six batters on an  array of fastballs and curveball.    He also revealed that he has a long way to go before he makes anyone forget  about Dwight Gooden, surrendering three home runs and falling behind in the  count to 14 of the 27 batters he faced.    The result: six innings, six hits, six runs, four walks and six strikeouts.    "I felt good, and my arm felt real good," said Benes, who was out 15 days in  Wichita with tendinitis in his right shoulder. "But I'm disappointed I lost. I  was the one who got the loss in a game we could have won and stayed on a roll.    "Things will get better. I've still got a lot of things to work on. You just  don't overpower hitters here like you do in Wichita."    Benes learned the hard way that you can't get by solely on your fastball in the  big leagues. He said he threw 12 to 15 changeups in the game, which is quite  remarkable considering that he threw a combined total of about 20 in his 21  minor-league starts this season.    Only one problem. He had difficulty throwing any for strikes. And when it came  time to throw a pitch in a crucial situation, the Braves knew exactly what was  coming.    Evans hit a three-two fastball in the second inning for a bases-empty homer  into the right-field seats.    Oddibe McDowell came back with another homer in almost the same spot in the  third inning on a two-zero pitch.    "I'm going to give up homers, I know that," said Benes, who has yielded 17 in  his past 66 innings, after not allowing any in his first 75 innings. "So the  solo homers don't bother me. It's the others that hurt."    The Padres took a 3-2 lead in the fifth before Benes found out that the big  leagues aren't all that they are cracked up to be. With one out and Brave  pitcher Derek Lilliquist on first, McDowell hit a line drive into right. Right  fielder Chris James, who would extend his hitting streak to a career-high 16  games, squinted into the sun trying to pick up the ball. It was no use. By the  time he saw it, it was falling by his feet. McDowell wound up with a double,  and Lilliquist was at third.    Jeff Treadway, the man who would pull the hidden ball trick on Marvell Wynne in  the ninth inning, hit a ball toward the gap. Second baseman Roberto Alomar dove  and stopped it, saving one run, but the tying run scored.    Benes got ahead on Smith, the Braves' leading hitter, on a zero-and-two count  and then struck him out on a fastball. Benes knew it should have been the third  out but refused to allow himself to be distracted as Murphy strode to the  plate.    He worked Murphy to a two-two count, then tried to decide what to throw next.  He had struck Murphy out on a fastball in the fourth inning and figured he'd  fool him this time, throwing a curve. Surely, Murphy wouldn't be expecting  that.    Benes threw a curveball, and Murphy sent it deep into the left-field seats for  a three-run homer.    "I fell behind two-and-oh a lot tonight and got away with a few of them," Benes  said. "He didn't give me that chance that time, and that was pretty much the  game."    Still showing confidence in Benes, Padre Manager Jack McKeon stuck with him and  allowed him to get out of the fifth inning. And when the inning ended, with  Benes having already thrown 108 pitches, the Padres tried something to which  Benes is not accustomed.    They left him in the game.    Rarely has he been allowed to throw more than 100 pitches in double-A or  triple-A this season, but this time, McKeon let him go out for the sixth.    Instead of showing signs of weariness or fatigue, Benes mowed down the Braves  one-two-three for the first time in the game, on two ground balls and a  strikeout. He was pinch-hit for in the bottom of the sixth, then watched in  frustration with his teammates as the Padres' ninth-inning rally fell short  when Wynne was bamboozled on the hidden-ball trick.    "I was very impressed with Benes," McKeon said. "He had problems with his  off-speed pitches and breaking pitches, but I saw a lot out there. We can get  that straightened out in a week or so. I saw a lot of promise out there."    Tom Romenesko, the Padres' director of player development who has seen Benes  perform more than anyone else in the organization, said: "There's no question  that Andy Benes will pitch in the major leagues, pitch well in the major  leagues and stay here for a long, long time.    "There's no doubt at all about that."    Padre Notes    Atlanta Brave left fielder Lonnie Smith, seeing Andy Benes for the first time  before the game, said: "What position does he play, center field?" When he was  told he was the Padre starting pitcher in game one of the doubleheader, Smith  said, "You're kidding me? A guy that big?" . . . Padre left fielder Bip Roberts  homered in the fifth inning for his first home run since Aug. 15, 1986. His  last homer had been in the second game of a doubleheader against Cincinnati  Reds pitcher Tom Browning, a span of 255 at-bats. . . . After going 238 games,  Sept. 13, 1987-June 4, 1989, without doing so, the Padres have scored in double  figures four times in their past 60 games.

headline:   THEY'RE ALL STILL 'CRANKEES' AFTER ALL THESE YEARS   
text:   This week, Dallas got mad at Lou. Dallas has Lou's old job. Lou has Billy's old  job. Everyone works for George, who leads the Crankees to paranoia, but not  pennants.    Lou is a TV announcer. Dallas is the manager. Lou suggested a leadoff hitter to  Dallas after George suggested new coaches. Dallas said he expects to be fired.  But Dallas won't quit. No sir.    Where's Billy, anyway?    "You know what the problem is here?" Dallas said. "The problem here is that  there's too much damned pressure to win a baseball game every day. Every one of  the guys who's been here thinks that way, and they think that way because of  the guy up there."    The guy up there is George. He changes managers the way fat people change  diets. The Crankees play in the AL Least, not the AFC East. Still, George  becomes very upset if they don't win every day.    Meanwhile, Dallas' pitching staff has allowed the most runs in the majors. This  makes it very difficult to win every day. George doesn't want to hear it. He  wants the coaches' heads. Lou wants a new leadoff hitter.    Where's Billy, anyway?    The Crankees have won more games than any other team in this decade, but no  world titles. The last time they were shut out in a decade was 1910-1920.  Dallas began the '80s managing the world champion Phillies. Now this.    Anyway, Lou said he doesn't want Dallas' job, when of course he does.  Sportswriters say Roberto Kelly should bat leadoff. Why can't sportscaster Lou?  Touchy Dallas. Tough guy Dallas. He'll call his boss names, but he won't quit.  No sir.    George, Lou, Dallas.    Dallas, Lou, George.    Where's Billy, anyway?    SHOWDOWN OF THE WEEK: Back to baseball. More than 45,000 tickets have been sold  for each of the three games between the Angels and A's at Anaheim Stadium this  weekend. The most compelling matchup will be Saturday's nationally televised  duel between Jim Abbott and Bob Welch.    Abbott (10-7) has emerged as a strong candidate for Rookie of the Year, but for  once he's not the central figure in a human-interest saga. Welch's wife, Mary  Ellen, gave birth to their first child July 27. His mother died the next day.    Since then, Welch has lost two straight starts. "It's been a battle to get  refocused," he said. "It busts your heart a little bit. I had the most  wonderful thing happen in my life, and then the saddest thing, all in a period  of 24 hours."    SENIOR-ITIS: The Senior Baseball Assn. staged an impressive draft Tuesday (Mark  Fidrych, J.R. Richard, et al) but no one has signed a contract yet. The  selected players simply returned index cards indicating interest.    The teams in eight Florida cities will be made up of former major-league  players over the age of 35 -- except catchers, who must be over 32. League  officials want play to begin on Nov. 1 and last three months, with five to six  games a week.    Dick Williams (West Palm Beach) and Gates Brown (Orlando) are expected to be  named managers shortly.    SAVE OF THE WEEK: Jeff Reardon stayed behind in Minnesota at the start of the  Twins' three-game visit to Baltimore on Monday so that he could remain with his  wife, Phebe, who underwent exploratory surgery on a lump in her thymus gland.    After Phebe learned that the lump was benign, she instructed Jeff to head to  Baltimore with the orders, "save the game for me." Reardon caught a 3 p.m.  flight, changed planes in Chicago and arrived at Baltimore Washington  Iternational by 7:30.    He took a cab to Memorial Stadium, and was in uniform by the fourth inning. To  complete the story, he earned his 20th save in the Twins' 4-2 victory, and is  now the only active pitcher with 20 saves in eight straight seasons.    "The best day I can remember," Reardon said.    FOUL CALL: Dave Stewart was the victim of a scoring blunder in Seattle when  Mike Kingery was awarded an inside-the-park homer after hitting a line drive  that A's left fielder Stan Javier booted to the wall.    "If he wants to call that an inside-the-park home run, then Lassie wasn't a  dog," Stewart said. "That ticked me off so much I had to give up a real one to  give the scorekeeper a chance to see what a real one looks like."    Jeffrey Leonard was the beneficiary of Stewart's lesson for official scorer  Steve Ellis. Stewart has allowed a club-high 17 home runs, including 10 in his  last 43 1/3 innings.    NO DIFFERENCE: In 12 games since trading for designated hitter Harold Baines,  the Rangers have gone 5-7 and averaged only 3.67 runs. Baines has the  game-winning RBI in four of the victories.    The Rangers lost, 3-2, to the Orioles Sunday despite fielding a lineup with a  combined .302 average -- and that included catcher Chad Kreuter, batting .127.    BIG DIFFERENCE: In 11 games since trading for pitcher Frank Viola, Mets  starters are 7-0 with a 1.68 ERA, three shutouts and five complete games. One  problem: Viola's support in New York hasn't been any better than it was with  Minnesota.    The Mets scored four runs in his first two starts, so he's 1-0 with a  no-decision despite allowing only three earned runs in 15 innings. The Twins  scored a total of 15 runs in 10 of Viola's 12 losses.    FREAK INJURY I: Mickey Hatcher, the Dodgers' leading hitter (.322), was  entertaining friends at his home Saturday night when a rock came through his  window. He raced outside to chase the vandals, only to suffer a pulled left  hamstring.    Nice guy that he is, Hatcher said he wouldn't press charges if the window was  replaced.    "I was young once," he said.    FREAK INJURY II: This one's even better. Blue Jays reliever David Wells was  rushed to a Toronto hospital early Saturday after putting his hand through a  window. Wells, a lefty in every sense of the word, said he was sleepwalking.    He required five stitches in his left thumb, but the wound was minor. Wells  claimed he also was sleepwalking on the Jays' last trip to Seattle. With a  10-game trip looming to Kansas City, Boston and Baltimore, he has been sent to  a sleep-disorder clinic.    SEE WHAT A VACATION CAN DO? The Indians' Tom Candiotti is 10-0 with a 1.56 ERA  the last two seasons after coming off the disabled list (6-0 last year after  Aug. 19, 4-0 this year after July 19).    "We're going to make this an annual event, whether Candy needs it or not,"  Indians Manager Doc Edwards announced this week. "Every season, we're going to  give him a two-week sabbatical."    The Brewers clocked Candiotti's curveball at 52 m.p.h. in a recent start, and  only one of his fastballs at 80. "He looks like Nolan Ryan after seeing some of  that other stuff," Terry Francona said.    MILK DELAY: Braves Manager Russ Nixon was incensed when the Reds proceeded with  their Farmer's Night activities on Friday after a 45-minute rain delay. It only  made matters worse when Braves bullpen coach Roy Majtyka and reliever Joe  Boever lost the cow-milking contest to Reds catcher Tom Oliver and pitcher Tom  Browning.    Lighten up, Russ.    The Braves won, 7-1.    SHAKE IT UP, BABY: Remember Scott Scudder, the Reds pitcher who received news  of his demotion in Los Angeles the moment an earthquake shook the city? He knew  just what to do when an earthquake hit San Francisco on Tuesday: "I left my  phone off the hook all day."    AROUND THE HORN: Wouldn't it be something if Bob Knepper helped the Giants edge  the Astros in the National League West? The Giants, decimated by injuries,  signed Knepper after he was released by the Astros with a 4-10 record and 5.89  ERA. The Indians also showed interest, but Knepper wanted to return to his  original team. He allowed two runs in six innings in his first start.    Braves left-hander Tom Glavine is 4-0 against the Dodgers this season, but  that's nothing. Glavine's first pitching coach in the Braves' system, Larry  Jaster, shut out the Dodgers five times for the Cardinals in 1966.    Speaking of the Braves, John Smoltz is winless in four decisions since July 7,  the day after he was named to the All-Star team.    The latest player to wear glasses is the Royals' Kevin Seitzer. Seitzer has  20-20 vision -- the glasses make it 20-10. "It's amazing; all the images are  sharp and clearer now," Seitzer said. Alvin Davis and Glenn Braggs are other  players who benefited from trying corrective lenses. Eddie Murray was insulted  by the idea in altimore.

headline:   WINSTON WEST TO STOP AT SAUGUS;    TIGHT POINTS BATTLE, BIG PURSE FEATURED IN SERIES EVENT   
text:   Fans at Saugus Speedway will witness a few uncommon sights tonight as the $1.3  million Winston West Series highlights the track's biggest night of the season  with the Winston 200.    For openers, the race will include something foreign to Saugus: pit stops.    "They'll be able to change tires, refuel, everything they need to do," Saugus  promoter Ray Wilkings said.    That's because tonight's race -- the first Winston West event at Saugus in 12  years -- will be a 200-lap, 66.6-mile marathon, the longest race in the 50-year  history of the one-third-mile paved oval. The last Winston West race at Saugus,  in June, 1977, was 150 laps.    Consequently, fans will see some unfamiliar faces and some unfamiliar cars. Big  cars. Like Monte Carlos and Firebirds.    "Basically, a Winston Cup car," Wilkings said. "The closest thing you can get  to Winston Cup on the West Coast."    Indeed, the Winston West Series has evolved into NASCAR's most lucrative racing  endeavor on the West Coast. And tonight's purse is expected to exceed $31,000,  with approximately $5,000 going to the winner.    But there is more than money at stake. Never in its 36-year history has the  series featured so competitive a battle for the championship, so tonight's  action figures to include some old-fashioned, barn-burning door handle-to-door  handle racing.    Consider:    With eight of 11 events completed, points leader Bill Schmitt of Redding is  clinging to a one-point lead over defending series champion Roy Smith of  Victoria, Canada. Rookie surprise Bill Sedgwick of Van Nuys, the only series  competitor who is a former Saugus regular, is third, 54 points behind Smith.    Only 149 points separate the top five drivers, only 215 separate the top six.    In the past three races, the lead has changed hands 37 times.    In last week's race at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield, Smith and Schmitt  swapped the lead seven times during the final 81 laps before Smith took the  checkered flag by 0.6 seconds.    Sedgwick, who survived a troublesome pit stop on Lap 160, rallied to nip  Schmitt at the finish to claim second. With another win, Sedgwick will become  the first series rookie to win three races.    "The chance of both Schmitt and Smith having a problem in the next three races  is probably pretty slim," Sedgwick said. "But I'm here to keep the heat on as  best I can, that's for sure."    A look at the top competitors, between whom one could hardly wedge a gasket:    Schmitt: A lumberjack by profession and a Winston West competitor since 1974,  Schmitt has logged the most career earnings of any active series competitor  with $407,629. He won championships in 1977 and 1979, and, although his points  lead over Smith is the smallest of margins, Schmitt insists that he feels no  pressure.    "It's been the Schmitt and Smith Show and it seems like it's getting down to  that," Schmitt, 53, said. "But I've been at this a long time. I feel if I go in  with the attitude of winning, that'll keep me in front. I'm going down there to  win."    Despite his points lead, winning is something Schmitt has accomplished just  once this year. His victory July 4 in Portland, Ore., was the 15th of his  career. He has seven top-five and eight top-10 finishes this season. Schmitt  last raced at Saugus in 1977.    "I remember the track was more difficult than any other track I've been on," he  said.    Smith: The Winston West titlist in 1980, '82 and '88, Smith, 45, is the series'  only active three-time champion. With his second victory of the season at Mesa  Marin, Smith has trimmed Schmitt's lead to a point and reduced the title race  to a two-car battle. Smith is the series' leading money winner this season with  $32,910. He has earned $278,579 in his Winston West career, which began in  1973.    Sedgwick: With two wins, eight top-five finishes, nine top-10 finishes and  $21,975 in earnings, Sedgwick, 34, has all but clinched rookie-of-the-year  honors. Sedgwick, who competed in Saugus' Street Stock and Sportsman divisions  from 1979 to '83, leads the rookie standings with 24 points. His nearest  challenger, Jerry Bowers of Meridian, Ida., has 14.    "Our goal this year was to be rookie of the year," Sedgwick said. "Being in the  points race, that makes it all the better."    Hershell McGriff: With 1,221 points, McGriff, in fourth place, trails Sedgwick  by just 48 points. "Mathematically, I guess I could win the championship, but  it isn't probable," said McGriff, a resident of Portland and Green Valley,  Ariz. "But I could catch Sedgwick."    McGriff, 61, the series' oldest competitor, began racing in 1945 and has 14  victories at now-defunct Riverside International Raceway. McGriff considers his  victory in the 2,178-mile Pan-American Mexican Road Race in 1950 the highlight  of his career.    A series competitor since 1971, McGriff is the only active driver with a  Winston West win at Saugus, although he has not raced there since 1974. He has  competed in 166 Winston West events, won 32 and has 109 top-10 finishes. His  career Winston West earnings total $343,837.    Rick McCray: A resident of Highland, Calif., McCray, 33, is fifth in the points  standings with 1,176 but has yet to win a race. "My problem is I'm running out  of my own pocket and nobody else's, so I gotta be extremely conservative,"  McCray said. "I don't like making excuses, but what can I say?"    McCray last raced at Saugus in 1986 when he finished fifth in a NASCAR  Southwest Tour race. He has three top-five and six top-10 finishes.

headline:   SHOUP, CLU MAY END UP IN COURT;    LAWYER WARNS SCHOOL LEGAL ACTION PROBABLE IF COACH IS DENIED FOOTBALL POST   
text:   His job as football coach at Cal Lutheran University is under siege. So what  will Bob Shoup, master tactician and winner of 182 games and 13 league  championships, do?    Nothing out of the ordinary.    He will show up for work, watch films, plot strategy, converse with his staff  and players, supervise practice and try to ignore the fact that he has been  cast as an unwanted man by the school that has called him coach for 27 years.    In a news conference Friday afternoon at CLU, Shoup and his Westlake  Village-based attorney, Jim Armstrong, outlined plans to "dot the I's and cross  the Ts" in terms of fulfilling the coach's written contract with Cal Lutheran  and threatened a lawsuit if the school does not abide by the same document.    That contract, which was negotiated in April, calls for Shoup to coach CLU's  football team during the upcoming season before taking a one-year sabbatical  leave beginning in January and expiring in December, 1990, Armstrong said.    The school announced earlier this week that Shoup would be welcomed back from  his sabbatical, as a teacher, but that his coaching career at Cal Lutheran  would conclude at the end of the upcoming season. However, Shoup claims that as  a tenured professor he is entitled, by the terms of CLU's faculty handbook, to  reclaim the same job he left -- including that of the head football coach.    Jerry Miller, Cal Lutheran's president, disagrees. He said Wednesday afternoon  that Shoup is tenured as a teacher but not as a coach.    "The university always retains its prerogatives and initiatives for the  appointment of coaches on an annual basis," Miller said. "I am not aware of any  university in the country that has a coaching position that is controlled by  tenure considerations."    Cal Lutheran plans to begin a national search for Shoup's successor this fall  and to have a new head coach by January. All of which could lead to a bizarre  scenario should two coaches claim the Kingsmen football program as their domain  before the start of the 1991 season.    Miller said the school's announcement that Shoup would be dropped as CLU's  football coach at the end of the 1989 season was "built upon earlier agreements  and conversations with Coach Shoup" dating to February.    "The proposals were initiated by Coach Shoup himself," Miller said. "We  discussed them fully in the conference which he had with me for more than an  hour on Tuesday afternoon, which preceded the university's issuance of any  statement on this matter."    Shoup says that he approached James Halseth, CLU's dean of students, with an  "early retirement plan" which was tentatively agreed to but later was altered  by the school. Shoup declined the school's offer and was later asked to resign.    The subject of retirement came up again when Shoup met with school officials  Tuesday morning. "They suggested it as a possibility," Shoup said earlier this  week, "and I said no."    At the press conference, Armstrong warned CLU officials that should they  "attempt to interfere with (Shoup's) existing written contract any further,  we'll probably see them in a court of law."    Shoup, speaking with his wife Helen at his side, said he has not been told why  the university wishes to replace him, but he surmised that his age, the  "misfortunes of the football program" in recent years (the Kingsmen are 16-27  since 1985) and "controversy" may have been factors.    "The timing has to be in some way linked to the move to the Division III and  the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference," Shoup said.    Shoup, 57, who is 182-81-6 at CLU, had argued against the school moving out of  the NAIA Golden State Athletic Conference and NCAA Division II Western Football  Conference to join the non-scholarship SCIAC.    Since the school's decision to make the switch last fall, Shoup said he has  tried to maintain a positive outlook.    "The NCAA Division III and the SCIAC are obviously a part of where we're going  and I will support to the best of my ability all the rules and regulations and  policies of those governing bodies."    "I just want to coach football this year," he added.    Miller declined to state a reason for the coaching change, citing a school  policy against public discussion about personnel matters.    Armstrong, himself a former college football coach, charged that Shoup should  be "praised and acclaimed" for his contributions to Cal Lutheran's development  as a university, rather than be the subject of "a slinky, what I consider  cheap, effort to pressure him out of a job."    He also claimed that Shoup had been threatened in writing with "consequences,"  including possible termination, if he spoke to the media. Shoup declined to  divulge who authored the warning and no evidence of such a letter was made  available.    Miller, who was interviewed from his office after the news conference, declined  knowledge of such a threat. "I have no knowledge of any kind of threat or  suggestion," he said. "It certainly didn't emanate from me or my office or  anybody who works close to me or reports to me."    Meanwhile, the start of this season draws ever closer. Cal Lutheran will play  its annual alumni game Sept. 2 before opening its regular season against Sonoma  State the following Saturday.    "I feel my first responsibility right now lies with the players here at Cal  Lutheran who have elected to stay in a very difficult situation, knowing  they're going to be competing at a Division II schedule under Division III  guidelines," Shoup said. "I feel a real responsibility to those players."

headline:   MOTOR RACING / VINCE KOWALICK;    KELLEY LOOKS FOR WAY TO CASH IN ON HIS HOBBY   
text:   Brian Kelley collects trophies. Lots of them.    "I have about 50 or 60," said Kelley, Saugus Speedway's Hobby Stock division  points leader. "When I first started racing, all I wanted was a trophy. But  now? Money!"    Kelley seemingly is capable of putting money where his trophies are. Two weeks  ago Kelley, a 23-year-old track sophomore from Arleta, posted his sixth  main-event win of the season -- most of any driver in any division at Saugus.  He also has posted seven "fast times," the top one-lap qualifying time of the  evening -- also a track high.    But Kelley won't soon be driving for dollars. Not as long as he remains a  member of the track's Hobby Stock class. Whether driving in a main event or a  heat race, it's all just a trophy dash for Kelley and his competitors.    Hobby, you see, is the operative word in Hobby Stock, Saugus' lower echelon of  racing. The division offers no monetary reward for main-event wins or track  championships.    Only trophies.    "My roommates are going to throw me out if I bring any more home," Kelley said.  "Last week, I gave a trophy to a little kid in the pits. He wanted an  autograph. I said, 'Here's a trophy.'    "Trophies mean a lot, but after a while, it gets to the point where you're  spending your rent money on tires."    Shannon Flavin of West Hills has won five Hobby Stock main events -- second  only to Kelley among Saugus drivers. In his fifth season, Flavin, fourth in the  points standings, estimates his trophy total at 25 to 30.    But Flavin, 28, is more concerned with his operating costs that, he says, have  exceeded $10,000 this season.    "At the beginning of the season, I had so much money set aside and I used it up  real fast," Flavin said. "I enjoy racing, but this is probably my last year. I  gotta start thinking about my future. I can't be spending $10,000 a year."    Having to compete for virtually nothing is a common complaint among Hobby Stock  drivers, who have in the past petitioned Saugus officials -- with little  success -- for a piece of the financial pie.    "That's the way most tracks' entry-level division is," Saugus promoter Ray  Wilkings said. "If you want to run for money, go to Street Stocks. If you want  to run cheap and keep it competitive, run Hobby Stock."    That thinking is prevalent at short tracks throughout the country. Saugus'  Hobby Stock division is considered a "claimer" class in which any driver can  "claim" another driver's vehicle by presenting $500 at the end of the evening.    The idea is to discourage drivers from spending money to improve performance  and consequently promote parity among competitors.    "Nobody's going to kill each other over a trophy," Wilkings said. "It's not  like the dog-eat-dog competitive nature of Street Stocks. But they put on a  hell of a show.    "I've told them, 'If you want to compete for money move up to Street Stocks.  You've proved yourself in Hobby Stocks. Go to Street Stocks and prove your  competitive nature.' It's not that big a move."    Kelley admits that the situation is "a little hard to swallow." But he plans to  take Wilkings' advice next season.    "The only way I would stay (in Hobby Stocks), is if they pay," Kelley said.  "They way I look at it, if a guy brings his car through the gate, he should get  paid."    Motor Sports Weekend: Stock-car racing at Ventura Raceway will not resume until  Sept. 1 as the Ventura County Fair gets under way next week. The one-fifth-mile  dirt oval, however, will be the scene of the fair's Motor Sports Weekend,  beginning with the annual Ventura County Fair Motocross on Aug. 18.    Final-round qualifying took place last weekend. One-hundred and forty riders  will compete in seven classes, ranging from 80cc beginners to 500cc  professionals in the motorcycle division, and 250cc beginners to 500cc  professionals in quad racers (four-wheel vehicles).    Total purse for the motocross will be about $7,000, according to track manager  Jim Naylor.    On Saturday, the raceway will feature a "Monster Truck and Tractor Pull."    Racing begins Friday at 2 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. on Saturday.    Information: 805-656-1122.    Points standings: Don Prudhomme of Granada Hills is fourth among Funny Car  competitors in the National Hot Rod Assn. Winston Drag Racing Series points  standings after qualifying second in the Seafair Nationals last weekend in  Kent, Wash..    Prudhomme lost in Sunday's semifinals.    Tom Kendall of La Canada finished fourth in the Sports Car Club of America's  Trans Am Series race in Lime Rock, Conn., last weekend and is third in the SCCA  Trans Am points standings after eight of 14 events.    Keith Spangler of Northridge leads Gary Sigman of Carson by a point to pace the  Saugus Sportsman division points leaders. Spangler, however, trails Sigman by  248 points among the leaders of the Sunbelt Region of the NASCAR Racing Series  standings, which bases its standings on victories at 11 short tracks in  California, Alabama, Arizona, Florida and Texas.    Sigman, with eight top-five finishes, is in 32nd place with 2,385 points.  Spangler, also with eight top-five finishes, is 46th with 2,137 points.    Will Harper of Tarzana, with 13 top-five finishes, is 25th with 2,524 points to  lead all drivers from Saugus. The top 10 drivers at season's end will share a  $15,000 purse.

headline:   DIGEST: SHIMOYAMA TRANSFERS TO N. HOLLYWOOD   
text:   Suzi Shimoyama, the most valuable player last season for the Louisville High  girls' basketball team, has transferred to North Hollywood High as a  participant in the school's newly established highly gifted student magnet  program.    Shimoyama, who was an All-San Fernando Valley League selection last year as a  freshman, will team with highly regarded Jacinda Sweet, a junior guard.    "This should really help take some of the heat off of Sweet," North Hollywood  Coach Rich Allen said. "She's been getting double- and triple-teamed all  summer. They worked real well together in the (summer) games where both of them  have been there. They should be one of the best guard combinations around."    Shimoyama (5-foot-7, 125 pounds) averaged 6.5 points, 7.2 assists and five  rebounds a game at Louisville. North Hollywood was the Valley Pac-8 Conference  co-champion last season.    Right-hander Bill Scheffles pitched the first five innings to earn a win, had  four hits and scored six runs as Santa Susana defeated Richmond, Calif., 27-6,  in an elimination game of the U. S. Western Zone Pony baseball championships at  Pleasant Valley Park in Camarillo on Friday.    Santa Susana (9-2 in postseason play) will play the winner of Friday night's  game between Camarillo and Cache Valley today at 1:30 p.m.    Ryan Briggs was three for three with a three-run home run and Ryan Hankins had  a grand slam for Santa Susana.    Scheffles had four hits in his first four at-bats and scored six runs.    Encino, which did not play Friday, will play Rialto today at 4 p.m. in a  winners'-bracket game.    Union City, Calif., rallied for four runs in the bottom of the seventh inning  to defeat Conejo Valley, 5-4, in the Senior League Western regional tournament  at Hadland Park in Las Vegas.    Trailing, 4-1, Union City scored three runs on Chris Dean's two-out double.  Dean scored on consecutive singles.    Jeff Naster threw a five-hitter in a losing effort for Conejo Valley (14-4).  Teammate Ryan Kritscher was two for three and drove in a run and Cory Bowen  added two hits.    Had Conejo Valley won, it would have faced Union City today for the title.    Tommy Kendall, a 22-year-old UCLA student from La Canada, qualified 17th on  Friday for the NASCAR Budweiser at the Glen road race in Watkins Glen, N.Y.    Kendall, a former IMSA sports car champion who is making his first NASCAR  start, qualified with a speed of 118.463 m.p.h.    Morgan Shepherd of Conover, N.C., covered the 2.48-mile, six-turn Watkins Glen  International road course at 120.456 m.p.h. to earn the pole position for  Sunday's race. The purse is $170,000.    Emilee Klein of Studio City fired a final-round 80 on Friday to finish in a  two-way tie for 11th place in the Betsy Rawls Girls Junior Championship at  Hercules Country Club in Wilmington, Del.    Klein, a sophomore at Notre Dame High, had rounds of 74-80-80 -- 234 over the  6,015-yard, par-72 course. Tonya Blosser of Athens, Ohio, won with a six-over  222.    Zack Lee of Thousand Oaks, 13, won a bronze medal in the parallel bars  competition at the Pan American Cup, held last month in Victoria, Mexico.    Lee represented the U. S. national team in the event and also finished fourth  in pommel horse and fifth on rings. Lee trains at the Monarchs Olympic Training  Center in Agoura Hills.    Herm Sater of Encino won a silver medal in age-group tennis competition last  month in the Maccabiah Games in Tel Aviv.    Sater, 61, was defeated by Victor Israel of England, 6-4, 6-4, in the  55-and-over division final.    Left-hander Tony Dardin of UCLA threw a three-hitter, struck out 10 and walked  one in eight innings as the Woodland Hills Astros defeated L. A. Harbor, 2-1,  in the third round of pool play in the U.S. Open semipro baseball tournament at  Galvin Field in Ontario on Thursday night.    Mike Lieberthal of Westlake High drove in the winning run with a double in the  eighth inning and Jeff Bodeau, a 1988 graduate of Saugus High, pitched a  scoreless ninth to earn the save.    Woodland Hills (28-9) is 2-1 in pool play in the 18-team tournament and will  play today at 4 p.m. and again tonight at 7.

headline:   BRAVES' TRICK MAKES PADRES' WYNNE, WIN DISAPPEAR IN NINTH   
text:   Marvell Wynne might as well have been standing on second base naked. Maybe then  he wouldn't have drawn as much attention, that some fans would at least have  hidden their eyes in embarrassment.    But he was standing there in full view, in a Padre uniform, having formerly  represented the tying run in the bottom of the ninth of the first game of  Friday's doubleheader with Atlanta.    Now he was just the second out, another victim of the old hidden ball trick.    The Padres lost, 6-5, and the thing that was both maddening and embarrassing  for them was that after Bip Roberts' perfect sacrifice in the ninth, Roberto  Alomar never got a chance to drive in the tying run.    What happened was this: Roberts was thrown out at first by first baseman  Darrell Evans, and second baseman Jeff Treadway, who took the throw, never  returned the ball to reliever Joe Boever.    Oh, he walked toward Boever, all right, then flicked his arm and said, "Come  on, let's go." Then he took his normal position.    Boever knew immediately what was going on. So did shortstop Andres Thomas, who  went to talk with Boever when Wynne didn't lead off right away.    Second base umpire Bob Engel knew, too.    "In fact, Treadway had the ball clear outside of his glove as he was walking  back," Engel said. "He had it in his bare hand and cupped his glove over it.  I'm surprised nobody saw it."    When Wynne wandered off the bag, Treadway sprinted over and made the tag. Wynne  never knew what hit him.    He was unavailable for comment between games.    Said Padre Manager Jack McKeon: "There was no purpose to him getting off base.  Where are you going to go?"    It was the first time Atlanta attempted it this year, and Treadway didn't think  of it until he took Evans' throw at first.    "That's when I decided to try it," Treadway said. "We need to do whatever it  takes to win ball games. When I got the ball, the third base coach (Sandy  Alomar) was giving him signs and telling him to pick up the outfielders. It was  a good play. I thought there was a possibility it would work.    "I hope there's not any kind of animosity for it. We're just trying to win  games."    Animosity?    "Hell no," said McKeon, who still wasn't sure after the game ended what had  happened.    The biggest thing the Braves had to worry about was Boever's whereabouts. For  the play be successful, rules say the pitcher can't be on or astride the  rubber.    "He can't be in a pitching-type position," Engel said.    So Boever paced around the grass behind the mound, faced home plate, bent over,  took a step onto the dirt and bent over again. Then Thomas came over for a  chat. Finally, Wynne took his lead.    "It took the longest time for Wynne to move off the bag," Engel said. "Thomas  even caught that and ran to the mound to create a diversion. Finally, Wynne  stepped off, and Treadway ran over and tagged him. When he made the tag, I  turned to the pitcher to make sure he hadn't been on the rubber. Then I knew it  was a legal out."    Wynne stood on second base for the longest time, as if he could will himself to  get out of the situation.    "He was kind of dumbfounded," Boever said. "I think he was standing out there  like, did that really happen? There's nothing you can do but stand out there."    Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar said he had never seen that play executed.    "It was a shock," Alomar said. "It's like, 'What the hell is going on?' But it  happened. And that was the game."    Treadway also played second in the second game. Animosity? Each time he batted,  he was booed.

Why not grant Higgins dignity by showing a photo of him taken prior to the  kidnaping?    At the very least, there should have been a warning to viewers before showing  the videotape of Higgins' hanged body.    NBC and ABC both opened up their news program with a still photograph of the  hanging. I wonder how quickly network executives would be to put on such a  photograph if it had been one of their relatives? Sadly, I have a feeling that  if it meant high ratings, they wouldn't hesitate.

text:   As much as I admire Calendar columnist Howard Rosenberg, he needs to rethink  his position on the showing of the corpse of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on  prime-time television ("Hanging Video: What Is TV's Role in Terror?," Aug. 2).    Rosenberg feels this portrayal was grotesque, obscene, unnecessary and  dangerous. I agree it was grotesque and obscene, as are the Shiites who  perpetrated the hanging and their "justice." As to unnecessary and dangerous, I  disagree.    I ask Rosenberg to read Tom Clancy's op-ed article, also printed in The Times  on Aug. 2, in which the novelist called for a hard line in responding to  terrorism.    After reading it, perhaps Rosenberg would perceive there is a need for  Americans to view the cruelties of the world so we can deal with them. We need  to realize there are bad people out there who want to hurt us.    When dealing with people such as the ones who killed Col. Higgins during his  captivity, we Americans need to call up our freedom-loving spirit and act, not  send a "message" to those who are not listening.    LYNDA GALLUP    Ventura

headline:   JUSTICE DELAYED;    ELDERLY JAPANESE INTERNEES WAIT FOR GOVERNMENT TO FULFILL REPARATIONS PROMISE   
text:   Once before they were gathered together like this -- only in those days, nearly  five decades ago, they lived behind barbed wire fences under the watchful gaze  of rifle-toting sentries.    Today, these 125 Japanese-Americans, who were interned at 10 relocation camps  during World War II, are living out their final years at the Japanese  Retirement Home in Boyle Heights.      Lost Homes, Businesses    Two-thirds of the 180 residents of the five-story retirement home were  incarcerated during the war because of their race. They lost their homes,  businesses and farms because of suspicion that they threatened national  security.    Now these former internees, some of whom are in their 90s, often sit in groups  playing cards, watching television or knitting, and occasionally exchanging  accounts of their days in the camps.    As they walk with measured steps from their sparsely furnished apartments to an  adjacent dining hall on Boyle Avenue, where they dine on Japanese-style rice  and fish, several former internees recall those years in detention. They talk  of promises made, but not yet kept.    They are waiting for letters of apology from the U.S. government as well as  monetary reparations of $20,000 per internee for the three years they spent in  the relocation camps. But many wonder whether they will still be around when  the apology and reparations finally arrive.      Difficult Time Recalled    "I wouldn't put another person through the hardships we had," said Dorothy  Utsunomiya, 71, as she sat under the shade of a tree at the retirement home.    The small woman, a widow who speaks with a tremble that comes from Parkinson's  disease, recalled what life was like in the relocation camps.    Utsunomiya was 24 when she was sent to a relocation camp in Gila, Ariz. She  recalls being forced to live in horse stalls and enduring almost daily sand  storms that lasted three hours at a time.    "The experience we went through as American citizens was wrong," she said.    As she spoke, another elderly woman overhearing the conversation was surprised  to find that they had shared the same camp but had never met. Both women  expressed fear that reparations may not come.    "I hope to get redress before I die," Utsunomiya said, "(President) Reagan said  that we would get it, but it's been a long time coming now. We may be dead  before we get it."      No Money Appropriated    One year ago, the former President signed a law earmarking $1.25 billion to  Japanese-Americans who lost their homes and businesses after they were  interned. The funds were to be distributed over a 10-year period, but to date  no money has been appropriated and not one former internee has received  reparations.    About half of the original 120,000 internees already have died -- and they  continue to die at a rate of more than 200 a month, according to the U.S.  Justice Department's Office of Redress Administration.    Of the estimated 60,000 who were living on the day Reagan signed the bill,  2,400 have since died. And, officials said, there are 16,000 -- like those at  the retirement home -- who are over the age of 70.    "Every day you look at the local obituaries and you can see people in their  60s, 70s and 80s dying," said Bert Nakano, spokesman for the National Coalition  for Redress/Reparations, a group considered largely responsible for raising  grass-roots support for reparations.    In the aftermath of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Americans of Japanese ancestry  -- U.S. citizens and aliens alike -- were rounded up on the orders of President  Franklin D. Roosevelt and placed in relocation camps across the country.      Shame Enforced Silence    For decades, most former internees were reluctant to publicly discuss their  experiences because they were ashamed and did not want to bring attention to  themselves.    But the civil rights movement of the 1960s created an awareness of the camps  among Japanese-American youth, and this awareness spawned the redress campaign.    Now, because of publicity the issue has generated, former internees speak  openly about "violations of civil rights" and of the U.S. Constitution.    Residents of the retirement home talk freely about the years they spent  incarcerated in camps, which were lined with row upon row of Army barracks  surrounded by guard towers.    For Utsunomiya and her husband, Ken, the incarceration began 30 days after  their wedding, and they were forced to leave their Santa Maria home.    She said the mouse- and scorpion-ridden quarters in Gila, Ariz., did not  particularly bother her. Nor was she extremely upset with the holes in the  floor covered by tops of tin cans and walls patched with boards. She also got  used to hanging sheets to divide the room that housed two families.    It was her freedom that she missed.    "There were guards in very high towers all night with lights and rifles," she  said. "We could go nowhere."    "They said that the guards and rifles were there for our own protection,"  another resident said. "But why were they pointed into the camps at us?"    Partly to provide food, and mostly to add a sense of hope to an otherwise empty  environment, the internees planted gardens and tended small farms around their  barracks.    Masato Uemura had once farmed carrots and green onions on a plot in North  Hollywood before losing everything.      Photos of Camp    Uemura, 91, lives in a sterile-looking one-room apartment in the retirement  home. He shuffles through the building with the aid of a metal walker. He  eagerly shows visitors black-and-white photographs of the relocation camp at  Manzanar, in the California desert, where he spent 18 months during World War  II.    From there, the Uemura family was separated, with seven of the children being  sent to Tule Lake, Calif., while Uemura, his wife, and their oldest child were  placed in a camp in Bismarck, N.D.    Now supported by his children, Uemura said he hopes to see the reparations in  his lifetime. He said he wants to give something back to his children for the  years they spent at the relocation camps.    "I feel sorry for my children," Uemura said.

headline:   MAN SEIZED IN CAMARENA CASE IS KIN OF EX-LEADER   
text:   The brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis Echeverria has been  arrested in Texas and is being brought to California for questioning in  connection with the 1985 murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, federal  authorities disclosed Friday.    Ruben Zuno-Arce, 59, was arrested Wednesday night in San Antonio by agents of  the Immigration and Naturalization Service, according to Gary Renick, deputy  INS chief there. He is to be brought to Los Angeles by federal marshals today,  and sources said he will be questioned next week before a federal grand jury  about the Camarena murder.      Spotted by Customs Agent    Renick said that "an alert inspector" spotted Zuno-Arce as he passed through  Customs in San Antonio after arriving on a commercial flight from Mexico on  Wednesday afternoon. He said Zuno-Arce was on a special list of people believed  to be drug traffickers.    INS officials said that at first they were unable to contact Drug Enforcement  Administration officials in San Antonio. So they allowed Zuno-Arce to go to a  home in San Antonio that he claimed he owned. When contacted soon thereafter,  however, DEA officials said Zuno-Arce was wanted in connection with the  Camarena case, according to Renick.    Zuno-Arce was put under surveillance and arrested at a San Antonio supermarket  Wednesday night.    Friday morning, Federal Magistrate Robert O'Connor in San Antonio ordered  Zuno-Arce held without bail as "a material witness" in the Camarena case and  directed that he be immediately transferred to Los Angeles.    O'Connor acted in response to an arrest warrant signed by U.S. District Judge  Edward Rafeedie, who presided over a trial in Los Angeles last year that  resulted in convictions of three men on charges stemming from the February,  1985, murder of Camarena. Seven other men have been charged with murder and  conspiracy in the case, including Mexican drug kingpins Rafael Caro-Quintero  and Ernesto Fonseca-Carrillo, both of whom are behind bars in Mexico City  awaiting charges in Camarena's murder.      Signed Declaration    O'Connor also was presented with a signed declaration from DEA Special Agent  Abel Reynoso explaining the government's interest in Zuno-Arce, who is married  to Echeverria's sister. Echeverria was Mexico's president from 1970 to 1976.    "Ruben Zuno-Arce has been identified by several informants, and in DEA  investigative reports, as a major narcotics trafficker in the Guadalajara  area," Reynoso said. "According to the informants, Ruben Zuno-Arce has made  statements that he has knowledge about the kidnaping and murder of a DEA  agent."    Additionally, Reynoso said it is believed that Zuno-Arce has "valuable  information" regarding the sale to Caro-Quintero of his former Guadalajara  home, where Camarena was tortured and murdered. Zuno-Arce sold the home to a  Mexican physician on Jan. 11, 1985, according to Mexican land records cited in  Reynoso's declaration. The doctor was a partner in a Guadalajara real estate  firm that sold the house to Caro-Quintero the same day.    Less than a month later, on Feb. 7, 1985, Camarena was kidnaped, tortured and  murdered. His body was found about four weeks later in a rural area in the  Mexican state of Michoacan.      Key Information    Reynoso's declaration states that it is believed that Zuno-Arce has information  regarding when Caro-Quintero moved into the house where Camarena was tortured.    "This information would be extremely valuable to the government's case relative  to forensic evidence, e.g. hairs and carpet fibers found at (the house), and  that the hairs found (there) could not have been deposited prior to Rafael  Caro-Quintero moving into the residence. Finally, it is further suspected that  Ruben Zuno-Arce may have visited Caro-Quintero at (the house) and may have been  a percipient witness to events surrounding the kidnaping and murder of Special  Agent Camarena."    Humberto Hernandez-Haddad, Mexico's consul general in San Antonio, said he  believes that Zuno-Arce will be brought before a federal grand jury in Los  Angeles that is investigating the Camarena murder.    Hernandez-Haddad said he had had "a number of phone calls from Mexico City"  about Zuno-Arce soon after he was arrested. He said he visited Zuno-Arce in  jail Friday morning and found him to be in good condition.    "He insisted he has no connection with criminal activity and needs a Los  Angeles lawyer," Hernandez-Haddad said.      Prosecutors Move    Gary Feess, the U.S. attorney, and Jimmy Gurule, an assistant U.S. attorney in  Los Angeles, who prosecuted the three men in the Camarena case last year, asked  Judge Rafeedie to issue the warrant for Zuno-Arce's arrest, according to court  documents.    Last February, at a memorial service commemorating Camarena's death, Gurule  said that further indictments were expected in the case. On July 27, DEA agents  in Los Angeles arrested Juan Jose Bernabe-Ramirez, a former member of the  Jalisco State Judicial Police. An affidavit from a DEA agent stated that  Bernabe-Ramirez had been present when Camarena was tortured and murdered and  that he had helped Caro-Quintero escape when he was about to be apprehended by  Mexican authorities shortly after the murder.    On Aug. 9, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted Bernabe-Ramirez on  murder and conspiracy charges in connection with the case. He is scheduled to  be arraigned before a federal magistrate on Monday morning.

headline:   MEDFLY INFESTATIONS   
text:   A look at the current situation and some previous Medfly infestations in Los  Angeles County.    JULY, 1989    ELYSIAN PARK AREA    Up to 34 Medflies found in July and August. Malathion sprayed Thursday night  over a 14-square-mile area northwest of downtown Los Angeles, to be followed  later this month by the release of 40 million sterile Medflies. A  70-square-mile area has been declared a quarantine zone; produce may not be  transported outside to other parts of Los Angeles. Authorities hope the  $1-million eradication effort will succeed by November.    LATE SEPTEMBER, 1988, TO JUNE, 1989    WEST LOS ANGELES    Forty-eight Medflies found in traps in Palms. A 35-square-mile region sprayed  with 1,400 gallons of malathion in October. A week later, 8 million sterile  Medflies released over 53 square miles of West Los Angeles; produce quarantined  over a 76-square-mile area for nine months. A billion-plus sterile Medflies  used in the $2-million eradication effort.    JULY THROUGH OCTOBER, 1988    SAN FERNANDO VALLEY    Six Medflies found in Northridge. A 16-square-mile area sprayed with malathion;  317 million sterile Medflies released in Northridge and Reseda. Quarantine over  a 62-square-mile area. Eradication cost $1 million.    JULY, 1987, THROUGH FEBRUARY, 1988    EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF DOWNTOWN L.A.    Three Medflies found in Maywood and Boyle Heights. A 22-square-mile stretch of  Maywood, Bell and Huntington Park and a 14-square-mile area of East Los Angeles  are each sprayed with malathion; more than 110 square miles of eastern Los  Angeles County placed under quarantine for six months. More than 700 million  sterile Medflies released in the $2-million eradication effort.    AUGUST THROUGH NOVEMBER, 1981    BALDWIN PARK    Five Medflies found, forcing spraying of malathion over nine square miles of  Baldwin Park and parts of West Covina, Irwindale and Valinda. Quarantine  imposed over a 101-square-mile area surrounding Baldwin Park. The Medfly is  later rediscovered in West Covina and La Puente, forcing malathion spraying  through March, 1982, over La Puente and through mid-April, 1982, over West  Covina.    JUNE TO DECEMBER, 1980    SAN FERNANDO VALLEY    After some Medflies are found, a 100-square-mile area of the Valley is placed  under quarantine. Authorities release 266 million sterile Medflies before  eradication is declared in late December.    1975    MARINA DEL REY    The first recorded finding of the Medfly in Los Angeles County. The eradication  effort took nine months.

text:   A former mental patient was ordered Friday to stand trial in the slayings of  two Universal Studios guards he reportedly said God told him to kill.    Los Angeles Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper ordered Nathan N. Trupp, 42, to stand  trial after a one-hour preliminary hearing in which a security guard and a  sheriff's deputy described the Dec. 1 shootings and recounted Trupp's  explanation.    Soper ordered Trupp to be arraigned Aug. 17 on charges that he killed guards  Jeren Beeks, 27, of La Crescenta and Armando Torres, 18, of Los Angeles after  they turned him away from the studio.    Trupp is also accused of slaying three people two days before the Universal  City killings. Those killings occurred in a bagel shop near where he lived in  Albuquerque, N.M.    Abelardo Solarez, another studio guard, testified Friday that Trupp casually  shot the two victims at the studio's main gate, shortly after they turned him  away when he asked to see actor Michael Landon. "He kept saying that someone  sent him to kill the two guards," Solarez said. "I asked him who it was and he  said, 'God.' "

text:   Police are investigating the death of a suspect who was held in the back seat  of a police patrol car after a violent rampage through a Sylmar neighborhood.    Los Angeles Police Detective Stephen Fisk said Friday that the death of the  33-year-old man, who witnesses said was "frothing at the mouth" and screaming  incoherently, appeared to be drug-related. Fisk said the cause of death will be  determined after an autopsy and toxicology tests are performed.    The victim, whose identity was withheld pending notification of relatives, was  declared dead about 2 p.m. Thursday by a doctor at the Van Nuys Jail. Fisk said  the man had been in police custody about 15 minutes when he died.    By the time police arrived at the jail, officers realized the man had stopped  breathing and they ran inside for a doctor, Fisk said.    The man was dead when the doctor got to the car. "It was that fast," Fisk said.    The victim was arrested in the 15500 block of Bledsoe Street after he allegedly  attacked an elderly couple who were getting into their car. Neighbors said he  appeared to be fighting with a mailbox and stumbling through bushes in a crazed  fashion, Fisk said.

headline:   NEWCOMERS GET A HANDLE ON SCHOOL   
text:   Nghi Tieu, an ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, speaks mainly Cantonese and a  smidgen of English. But on Friday, the 16-year-old stood before a crowd of  parents, peers and others and sang the opening lines of a Brazilian folk song  -- in Portuguese.    It was only fitting.    In an auditorium festooned with balloons, 220 students from a dozen countries  -- most of whom had arrived in the United States only a few months ago --  celebrated the end of their first session at the Newcomer Center. The center,  located at Crenshaw High School in Southwest Los Angeles, is a special Los  Angeles Unified School District program to help newly arrived immigrants adjust  to the U.S. education system.    The master of ceremonies was from El Salvador, the pianist from Nicaragua and  the choir from Vietnam, China and Mexico, among other places. Some students  performed humorous skits to show off their newly acquired English, such as one  about eating in a restaurant and finding a fly in the soup. One group of  Chinese students offered a stirring dance symbolizing the struggle for  democracy in their homeland.    "A lot of these kids are from troubled countries," teacher Guillermo Pasillas  said, "yet they're able to forget about that here. I see a lot of enthusiasm  and a lot of respect for education. They've been great to work with."    Open since July 3, the Newcomer Center is one of two special schools for  immigrants to be opened this year by the school district. The Crenshaw High  center, which started with a six-week summer session, will enroll up to 450  high school students in the fall for a yearlong program to help prepare them  for regular high school classes.    Instruction will be delivered in the students' native language for mathematics,  language arts and U.S. history and culture. They also will receive intensive  English instruction and physical education.    About 200 elementary pupils are expected at a second Newcomer Center opening  next week on the site of the former Bellagio Road School in Bel-Air.    The schools were the brainchild of former Board of Education member Alan  Gershman, who proposed the program two years ago because he believed that the  district needed to do more to ensure the success of the thousands of immigrant  students entering its schools.    "They were dropping out in huge numbers," said Maria Olmos, who directs the  Crenshaw center, "and we wanted to make sure that they would continue on in  school."    Most of the newcomer students live near downtown Los Angeles and have taken a  district bus to Crenshaw each day, Olmos said. More than 80% of the students  are natives of El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala. But others are from Hong  Kong, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.    Although most of the students emigrated with their families, about 10 left  their country without kin and are supporting themselves, according to school  psychologist Brad Pilon.    Some, like 17-year-old Rosa Saucedo from Mexico, said they find the U.S.  education system confusing and more difficult than schools back home. But  others, such as Ambi Bangis, 15, from the Philippines and Bussarin Kiewkram,  15, from Thailand, said they find the classes much easier.    "I don't have to study," Ambi said.

headline:   'ABORTION ASSEMBLY LINE' BLAMED IN DEATH   
text:   A Los Angeles woman who died after an abortion at Inglewood Women's Hospital in  1987 was the victim of "an abortion assembly line," in which a single doctor  performed 74 of the operations in one day, the lawyer for her family argued  Friday in Norwalk Superior Court.    In closing arguments during a malpractice trial against the now-closed hospital  and two of its doctors, attorney David Berglund said Belinda Byrd died because  doctors rushed her through surgery and failed to notice signs of internal  bleeding.    But defense attorneys said Byrd died from a rare blood clot that formed in her  lungs several hours after surgery.      'Three Doctors'    "Had three doctors been standing there at the time, the chances of that woman  surviving were practically nil," attorney David Weiss said. "This case doesn't  belong in a courtroom. It belongs in a textbook."    Byrd's mother and three teen-age children are seeking damages, alleging medical  malpractice against Dr. Steven Pine, who performed the abortion, the 28-bed  hospital and its chief of staff, Dr. Morton Barke. The trial will resume Monday  when the jury is scheduled to be charged by Judge Charles E. Frisco.      Weighed 95 Pounds    Byrd, who was 19 weeks pregnant at the time and weighed 95 pounds, sought the  abortion because her doctor warned her that another birth could prove fatal,  Berglund said. Byrd had undergone a Cesarean section in the births of each of  her three children.    Byrd was one of 74 women who received abortions from Pine on Jan. 24, 1987,  Berglund said. After an abortion that took about nine minutes, Byrd was  transferred to the recovery room, where she spent about seven minutes before  being taken to the hospital's west wing, Berglund said.    Berglund contended in the trial that it was unsafe for Pine to perform so many  abortions in one day and that patients were rushed through the hospital so  quickly that adequate monitoring of patients was impossible.    Officials of the Inglewood Women's Hospital said it was not unusual for one of  its doctors to perform 74 abortions in one day.    Inglewood Women's Hospital specialized in late-term abortions. Most abortions  are performed in the first three months of pregnancy. Byrd was nearly five  months pregnant.    Byrd's abortion ended about 4 p.m., and nurses noted on medical records that  her condition became critical sometime after 7 p.m. In dispute is the quality  of care she received in the intervening hours, the cause of death and whether  Pine and the hospital contributed to it.      Lapsed Into Coma    Byrd became unconscious and, after efforts to resuscitate her failed, she was  rushed to Centinela Medical Center. Byrd went into a coma and died three days  later.    A coroner's report concluded that Byrd died of a punctured uterus suffered  during the abortion. While not disputing that a punctured uterus occurred, the  defense argued that the hospital and the two doctors were not negligent in  their treatment of Byrd. Defense attorneys said slides taken by the coroner's  office after the original autopsy showed signs of a blood clot in the lungs.    Byrd's death helped to prompt state health officials to launch an investigation  of the hospital, which revealed what one official termed "battlefield  conditions." The state revoked the hospital's license in February, 1988.    Less than two weeks later, the facility was reopened as West Coast Women's  Medical Group, an outpatient facility specializing in abortions. Months later,  it was purchased by Edward Allred, a Long Beach physician who operates it as  part of his Family Planning Associates Medical Group, which runs numerous  abortion clinics throughout the state.    Berglund argued that Byrd's condition deteriorated slowly from the moment she  left the operating room but that her complaints of pain and weakness went  unheeded by the hospital staff. Only when she went into cardiac arrest did the  staff realize Byrd's desperate condition, Berglund said.    Weiss and Robert Reback, attorney for Barke and the hospital, argued that a  rare medical occurrence -- a piece of uterine tissue lodged in Byrd's lung --  led to massive clotting, hemorrhaging and eventually death.

headline:   CATHOLIC BISHOPS' REACTION TO SUPREME COURT RULING;    LEGISLATURES URGED TO RESTRICT ABORTIONS   
text:   Roman Catholic bishops have called on state legislatures to restrict abortions  and cautioned abortion opponents about the dangers of internal political  bickering.    In a lengthy statement issued by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops'  Committee for Pro-life Activities, the hierarchy also said the abortion debate  is being diverted from the issue of the "humanity of the unborn child" to  questions of a woman's privacy and personal autonomy.    The statement, "An Opportunity to Defend Life," is the church's first major  analysis of the abortion situation following the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3  ruling upholding a series of state restrictions on legal abortion while  ostensibly leaving untouched the key 1973 decision legalizing most abortions.    "The new direction taken by the court is cause for hope," said the committee,  headed by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago. "There is promise in the  court's invitation to states to establish new legislative limits on abortion."    At the same time, however, the bishops noted that the court "did not fully  recognize the right to life of unborn children," and said the church must press  its argument that "the evil of abortion begins with the humanity of the unborn  child."      'Central Truth'    "This central truth is often obscured in the current debate, where abortion is  presented solely as an exercise of personal autonomy or as a conflict between  state prerogatives and the individual right of privacy," the bishops' statement  said.    In the area of public policy, the bishops said the opportunities opened up for  states to restrict abortion by the court's Webster ruling "are limited and  complex."    But it urged legislators to push for short-term goals such as placing limits on  direct and indirect government funding of abortion, parental notification laws  and efforts to delay and make "hasty" abortions more difficult to obtain.    "We are committed to establishing constitutional protection for the unborn  child to the maximum degree possible," the bishops said. "Therefore, we urge  legislators, especially Catholics, to help build a consensus in our society in  support of the unborn child's right to life."    The bishops also took note of the deep divisions that have sometimes hampered  the anti-abortion movement's efforts. The bishops, led by Bernardin, have  sought to place their opposition to legal abortion in a context of "respect for  life" that also includes opposition to the death penalty, support for  anti-poverty social welfare programs and opposition to the U.S. nuclear arms  buildup.      Strategy Rejected    Conservative abortion opponents, however, reject the bishops' strategy of  making abortion a part of such a "seamless garment."    "The movement in support of abortion on demand is united in its agenda," the  bishops' statement said. "Pro-life Americans must not give their adversaries an  easy victory by launching attacks on each other over questions of political  strategy."    The bishops also warned that the post-Webster debate could lead to a new wave  of anti-Catholicism in the nation.    "Anti-Catholic sentiment has never been entirely absent from the pro-abortion  campaign," the bishops said, "but abortion rights advocates apparently seek to  revivify it now that the efforts of Catholics and other pro-life citizens have  begun to bear fruit."    But the bishops said they "do not intend to be ruled out of this or any social  debate by spurious interpretations of the 1st Amendment" that claim that the  church is seeking to establish and impose its theological views of the fetus on  the rest of the nation.

headline:   LA MESA MAKER OF TOXIC GAS IS DENIED PERMIT   
text:   The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District for the second time has  denied an operating permit to Phoenix Research Corp., which produces highly  toxic arsine and phosphine gases at its La Mesa plant.    However, the denial could soon become moot because officials at Union Carbide's  Linde Division, Phoenix Research's parent company, said Tuesday that the  controversial plant will be closed in late December. The company will begin  producing the two deadly gases at a remote plant now being completed in rural  Arizona, Linde spokesman Jim Secor said.    APCD Control Officer R. J. Sommerville said Tuesday that the plant "should not  be operating at all" in La Mesa because the gases pose a severe threat to the  health and safety of nearby residents and businesses.      Doubts About Closure    Sommerville also expressed doubt that Linde will actually close the plant by  the end of the year. In 1987, Linde failed to complete a previously announced  move to Washington state.    Linde, which expects to complete construction of the plant near Kingman, Ariz.,  by the end of January, has obtained applicable state environmental permits,  said James A. Wilkinson, executive director of the Mohave County Airport  Authority, a public agency that has sold land to Linde. Linde will not receive  an operating permit until state regulators inspect the finished plant, he said.    The San Diego permit denial will have little or no immediate effect because  regulators are "unable to enforce air pollution control laws against the firm"  under a lawsuit initiated by Phoenix Research, Sommerville said.    That court fight stemmed from the air pollution district's 1985 attempt to stop  production of the gases at Phoenix Research. The plant has operated in La Mesa  for 15 years, but regulators first learned about its existence from news  reports in 1985.    In 1986, shortly after the district first refused to issue a permit, Phoenix  Research won a court injunction that prohibited the district from enforcing its  regulations at the plant. The company filed a court suit that challenged the  district's right to issue permits and later appealed a Superior Court decision  that recognized the district's right to do so.    Several months ago, Phoenix Research installed a scrubber, a pollution-control  device designed to eliminate 99.9% of the arsine and phosphine gas that might  otherwise escape into the atmosphere during an accident. Then, Sommerville  said, the APCD and Phoenix Research agreed that the district would issue a  permit only if tests proved that the device neutralized 99.9% of the toxic  gases that would escape during a "worst case" accident.      Unhappy With Test Results    The district withheld the permit in a letter to Phoenix on Friday after tests  conducted by the company at another scrubber in another state failed to reach  the 99.9% efficiency level, Sommerville said. The scrubber "has reduced the  risk to the community but is still inadequate to meet APCD safety standards,"  he said.    Secor on Tuesday said that the scrubber "did do what it was supposed to do"  during the recent test. "The manufacturer of the scrubber has warranted to us  that it's 99.9% effective," he said.    Secor, who said the plant has "never had an incident" during its 15 years in La  Mesa, said the scrubber is providing sufficient protection for nearby residents  and businesses.    But Sommerville, who said he does not know for sure whether the scrubber is now  in use, said Tuesday that an accidental release of gases into the atmosphere  would still cause a severe threat to people who live or work near the plant, at  8075 Alvarado Road.    Federal limits for the two gases are extremely low -- 0.3 parts per million  (ppm) for phosphine and 0.05 ppm for arsine. A whiff of 500 ppm of arsine  causes instant death by freezing the hemoglobin in red blood cells.    According to county records, Phoenix Research at any one time has on hand as  much as 2,250 pounds of the deadly gas, which electronics companies use to  produce circuit boards.      Goal Seems Unmet    Diane Takvorian, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Health  Coalition, on Tuesday questioned whether the permit refusal will have any  effect. "It sounds like it doesn't achieve the goal that the community wants,  which is to shut the facility down," she said.    Secor reaffirmed that the plant will leave San Diego for a new location outside  Kingman by Dec. 31. "We're intending to operate at La Mesa no longer than the  end of this year, about three more months," he said.    But the permit denial will not speed the plant's closing. "I don't see us  shutting down any earlier," Secor said.    The company has 10 days to appeal the air pollution district's decision, and  both sides have the option of going back to court, Sommerville said.    The plant that has generated so much concern in La Mesa has also riled  residents in Kingman, a small town in the northwest corner of Arizona, more  than 100 miles east of Las Vegas. Linde's plan to build a plant in an  industrial park near the county airport fell apart earlier this year after  activists drew heavy support from many of Kingman's 12,000 residents.    The company subsequently acquired another tract that sits 11 miles south of  town. "It's much more isolated," Wilkinson said. "There ain't a swinging thing  out there. They have to build their own roads . . . and drill their own wells."    When completed, the plant -- along with a sister plant near the airport that  will produce relatively benign gases -- will provide about 25 new jobs for  residents, Wilkinson said. Another 25 employees will move to the town from  existing Linde operations.    Although a "hard-core group" still opposes the plant, a "clear majority" now  favors it at the far-flung location, Wilkinson said. However, the opposition  "has set us way back in terms of doing economic development," Wilkinson said.  "As far as our reputation goes, it set us back at least two years."    A Phoenix Research executive earlier this year said that the company would  spend at least $225,000 on the scrubber. The device would be moved to the new  plant in Arizona before gas production begins, the executive said.

Apparently, he worked  hard too. Hemingway labored for six months over the final chapter to his second  novel, "A Farewell to Arms," writing scores of different endings before  settling on the version that appeared in print. "There's this image of  Hemingway as a raucous, drinking guy and not a guy sitting so carefully at his  desk and slaving over the ending. Most people would instead picture Hemingway  dashing the ending off and going out to catch a marlin," said Lisa Middents,  assistant to the curator of the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy  Library in Boston. An exhibit of some of the 44 pages of draft endings, mostly  handwritten, goes on display today at the Hemingway Collection. The exhibit  commemorates the 60th anniversary of the novel's Sept. 27, 1929, publication by  Charles Scribner's Sons. The novel, set in Italy and Switzerland during World  War I, chronicles the romance between a young American ambulance driver and an  English nurse at an American Red Cross Hospital in Milan.     -- Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) took exception with U.S. News &amp; World  Report's depiction of Tennessee as a backward state.

In a humorous protest  letter to U.S. News Editor-in-Chief Mort Zuckerman, Gore said that though no  one might notice if one flipped Wyoming or Colorado, that is not so when  Tennessee is turned inside out. "I hope the magazine didn't mean to move  Memphis," Gore wrote. "As you know, every Federal Express package in the  country must first pass through Memphis.

headline:   BILL BARRON, 62; JAZZ COMPOSER, MUSIC EDUCATOR   
text:   Bill Barron, a reed player, jazz composer and educator, died last week in a  Middletown, Conn., hospital near Wesleyan University, where he had been a  professor of music for the last several years. Barron, whose career began in  his native Philadelphia 40 years ago, was 62 when he died Thursday of cancer.    Born William Barron Jr., he studied piano and tenor saxophone before mastering  the flute and soprano sax and came to New York City in the 1950s to perform  with Cecil Taylor, Philly Joe Jones and others.    One of his first jobs was with the Carolina Cotton Pickers.    Along with Jones, Benny Golson, John Coltrane and Jimmy Heath, Barron was  considered one of the talented, bop-oriented musicians to emerge from  Philadelphia after World War II.    "The thing about coming up in Philly," Barron said in a long-ago interview, "is  that all the fellows used to get together quite often. I remember always going  over to somebody's apartment or somebody's brother's place, with people like  Johnny Coles, Ray Bryant, Jimmy Heath and Calvin Massey, and we'd compare  notes."    In the early 1970s he began to play clubs with his brother Kenny, a pianist.    From 1968 to 1974, Bill Barron was director of the Jazz Workshop at MUSE (the  Bedford Lincoln Neighborhood Museum, operated by the Brooklyn Children's  Museum), where he presented regular concerts and taught improvisation,  composing, arranging, theory and reeds.    He started jazz programs on New York City radio and taught jazz at City  University of New York and Afro-American music at Wesleyan.    He earned a doctorate in education from the University of Massachusetts and was  seen on New York's PBS station WNET discussing music in the context of the  neighborhoods of the city.    In 1984, Broadcast Music Inc. honored him with its Pioneer of Jazz Award.    His seminal recordings include "The Next Plateau;" "Variations in Blue," which  in 1985 Times jazz critic Leonard Feather said contained "explosive hard-bop  lines;" "Jazz Caper;" "Tenor Stylings of Bill Barron;" "Motivation" and "The  Hot Line."    Survivors include his wife, Anna; two daughters; his mother; another brother  and two sisters.

headline:   HEDGECOCK STICKS TO HIS STORY WHILE TESTIFYING FOR HUNTER   
text:   Insisting that he had only "totally proper" personal and political financial  dealings with Nancy Hoover Hunter, former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock told  a U. S. District Court jury Tuesday that a campaign consulting firm funded by  Hunter was a legitimate business, not a device to funnel illegal contributions  to his 1983 mayoral race.    Repeating testimony from his 1985 trial, Hedgecock testified in Hunter's fraud  and tax-evasion trial that Hunter bankrolled the consulting firm, started by a  mutual friend, Tom Shepard, in the early 1980s as a routine business  investment.    Showing flashes of his trademark combativeness as he stuck to a story that he  has told frequently inside and outside courtrooms for 4 1/2 years, Hedgecock  contended that, contrary to prosecutors' allegations, Tom Shepard &amp;  Associates was not merely a sham operation established primarily to illegally  finance his mayoral race.    "Was there any discussion with Nancy Hoover or Tom Shepard about funneling  money to your campaign?" Hunter defense attorney Richard    Marmaro asked Hedgecock.    "No, never," Hedgecock answered.    Hunter, the former J. David &amp; Co. executive who, like Shepard, was one of  Hedgecock's closest allies during a political career that ended with his 1985  felony conviction, is being tried on 197 counts of fraud and tax evasion  stemming from her involvement with the now-defunct La Jolla investment firm.    The firm's namesake and Hunter's former live-in companion, J. David (Jerry)  Dominelli, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to  charges of bilking investors out of more than $80 million through an elaborate  Ponzi scheme in which clients were lured to the firm through phony records and  the promise of fabulous returns on their money.    Called as a defense witness, Hedgecock is one of the means by which Hunter's  attorneys hope to rebut prosecutors' contention that Hunter improperly took a  tax deduction for her investment in Shepard's firm when, in fact, she knew it  to be nothing more than a ruse to disguise tens of thousands of dollars in  illegal contributions to his 1983 campaign.    Paradoxically, however, by hoping to score points through Hedgecock's  testimony, the defense was forced to rely on someone who has been found guilty  of conspiracy charges that both Hunter and Shepard -- as well as Dominelli --  pleaded guilty to in 1986 plea-bargain deals. Thus, Hedgecock's denial Tuesday  of wrongdoing in his tangled financial and political relationship with the  three is contradicted by his own verdict -- which he argues was tainted by a  bailiff's jury tampering -- and three guilty pleas.      Similar Testimony    During his 1 1/2 hours on the stand before U. S. District Judge Earl Gilliam,  Hedgecock delivered testimony similar to that which he gave in his first 1985  trial, which ended in a mistrial with the jury deadlocked, 11 to 1, in favor of  his conviction on conspiracy and perjury charges. Hedgecock did not testify in  his second trial, in which he was convicted of 13 felony counts stemming from  charges that he falsified financial disclosure statements to conceal illegal J.  David contributions funneled to his campaign via Shepard's firm.    Now a radio talk-show host, Hedgecock is free pending appeal of his one-year  jail sentence -- an appeal in which an appellate panel's order for a full court  hearing on the jury-tampering allegations figures prominently.    Describing what he knew of Shepard's firm's formative period, Hedgecock said  that, in December, 1981, Shepard, who then served on Hedgecock's county  supervisorial staff, told him that he planned to leave to start a consulting  firm to be funded by Hunter. Noting that he and Hunter had had a falling out  after she left her husband to live with Dominelli, Hedgecock stressed that he  had no conversations with Hunter about that deal, adding that he relied solely  on Shepard's characterization of the matter.    In August, 1982, Hedgecock's campaign committee signed a contract with Shepard  for what then was an exploratory potential race for mayor -- a contest that  hinged on a vacancy being created by then-Mayor Pete Wilson's victory in the  November, 1982, U. S. Senate election. At the time, Hedgecock said he believed  that Shepard's firm had other clients.    "Did you have any reason to believe that Tom Shepard &amp; Associates was  anything other than a legitimate political consulting firm?" defense attorney  Marmaro asked.    "No -- I thought it was legitimate," Hedgecock said.    During his cross-examination by Assistant U. S. Atty. Stephen Clark, Hedgecock  visibly enjoyed the verbal jousting that led to several acerbic observations  from both sides, managing along the way to get in a few digs against some  longtime foes -- in particular, the San Diego Union and Tribune newspapers,  which he contends have treated him unfairly for years.    Clark, however, drew first blood by beginning his questioning of Hedgecock by  asking: "Are you the same Roger Hedgecock who was convicted in Superior Court  in October, 1985?" Hedgecock responded affirmatively, hastening to add that the  case is on appeal.      A Letter of Praise    The first of several light moments came when prosecutors sought to document the  warmth and closeness of Hedgecock's relationship with Hunter in an effort to  undermine his credibility.    To that end, Clark produced a letter sent by Hedgecock to Hunter in the early  1980s in which he said that a story about her that appeared in the San Diego  Tribune "looked great." Dismissing the letter as "one of hundreds" written  weekly for him by his staff, Hedgecock generated loud laughter among courtroom  spectators by adding: "I don't recall writing it, and I wouldn't have been so  lavish in my praise of the local paper."    On various occasions, Clark sought a yes or no answer from Hedgecock, only to  receive a longer explanation that frustrated the prosecutor's attempt to pin  down the former mayor. Once, for example, Clark inquired whether Hedgecock was  aware in the early 1980s that Hunter was wildly spending hundreds of thousands  of dollars on things such as houses and exotic cars, only to have Hedgecock  answer: "I was aware Nancy was a benefactor of a number of organizations in the  community."    "So the answer to my question is yes?" Clark said.    "The answer is the answer I gave you," Hedgecock snapped.    Clark also pressed Hedgecock for now-familiar details on his personal financial  dealings with Hunter, including a controversial oral-agreement loan that  Hedgecock used to remodel his South Mission Hills house shortly after being  elected mayor in May, 1983. That loan, which Hedgecock repaid with interest  started out at $50,000, but as expenses grew, it reached $130,000.    As he did in his own trial, Hedgecock insisted that, to the best of his  knowledge, Hunter used her personal funds for the loan, not -- as was shown  during his trial -- J. David corporate revenue. When asked about the lack of  conventional documentation of the loan's terms, Hedgecock said: "She's not an  institution or savings and loan. This was a personal loan . . . between  friends."    Trying to reinforce prosecutors' view of Tom Shepard &amp; Associates as little  more than a laundering operation for illegal political contributions, Clark  pointed to Hedgecock campaign expenses that were paid with J. David funds. In  each case, however, Hedgecock insisted that he had assumed that his campaign  committee had paid the bills or was unaware of the specifics.

headline:   ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS   
text:   A Times reader recently complained in Jack Smith's column that alphabetical  telephone numbers, such as DIAL-DWP, take too long to dial.    "By the time you have searched out the letters," said Ray G. Coutchie, "you  could have punched the numbers out, had your conversation and hung up."    Coutchie added: "This particular item has bugged me for some time."    Funny, how times change.    Three decades ago, many Californians were upset over the disappearance of  letter prefixes from their phone numbers. HOllywood, for instance, was replaced  by 46, ATlantic by 28, and VErmont by 83.    Ma Bell's "digitalization" campaign inspired the formation of the Anti-Digi  Dialing League in San Francisco and the Utility Users League in Los Angeles,  which fought valiant, if unsuccessful, battles.    The dismay was in part nostalgic.    San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli said that dropping a letter prefix was like  "tearing down a stately Victorian mansion and replacing it with a a parking  lot."    But there was also fear that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to  remember a seven-digit number.    A Pacific Telephone vice president inadvertently lent credence to that theory  when he was questioned by an attorney for the Utility Users League at a hearing  in 1964.    "Don't you have trouble remembering seven digits?" the attorney asked.    "None at all," the vice president replied.    "Please tell me your license plate number," the attorney said.    The vice president recited the three letters on his plate but couldn't remember  the three digits.    Speaking of letters and numbers:    Michael Tscheekar of Westchester challenges anyone to pronounce the name of the  street sign on La Cienega Boulevard (in accompanying photo).    "One Hundred Elevenst?" Tscheekar asks. "One Hundred One-One-Est? Or what?"    Or what seems easiest.    "Something's Fishy" is the headline in Alaska Airlines magazine above an item  about a Fishermen's Fiesta scheduled this weekend in San Pedro.    "Fishy" in more ways than one. The magazine says that San Pedro is "just north  of Los Angeles."    As the Duke demonstrated to the Hulk, the pen is mightier than the headlock.    Gov. George Deukmejian, a Sacramento middleweight, signed a bill that in effect  decreed that Hulk Hogan, Junkyard Dog, Brutus Beefcake and other professional  wrestlers are entertainers, not athletes.    The bill, introduced by Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Gardena), stripped the  state Athletic Commission of its control over wrestling, despite howls of  protest from the grapplers.    "It ain't a sport, it ain't an athletic contest," Floyd explained.    He pointed out that it was ridiculous to have physicians present at wrestling  matches.    "It would make more sense to have them at rock concerts," he added. "There's  more violence there."    Perhaps Floyd has unwittingly hit upon an idea: A state Rock 'n' Roll  Commission.    The calendar says it's fall, but spring is still in the air, judging from the  personals column in the newspaper LA Weekly.    The publication, which divides its entries into categories, drew 186 ads in its  current edition, compared to 118 in May.    LA Weekly's latest Hubba Hubba Barometer breaks down this way: "Men Seeking  Women" (104), "Women Seeking Men" (34), "Men Seeking Men" (33), and "Women  Seeking Women" (12).    Biggest percentage gainer was a fifth category that increased from one to three  entries.    It's labeled "Either."

text:   Elizabeth Watson's statement that "maybe Bush deserves congratulations for  choosing Quayle in spite of how foolish a move it seemed about a year ago," in  response to Vice President Dan Quayle's public assessment of "Star Wars,"  deserves comment (letter, Sept. 21).    The job President Bush gave Quayle -- to pop President Reagan's "Star War"  bubble -- could have just as easily been given to any vice president at hand,  or to the secretary of state, for that matter. Quayle remains a disastrously  ignorant next-in-command in case President Bush dies in office.    Seeing how responsibly Bush behaves in his job as President, I hope that at the  end of his first term he will quietly replace Quayle with a fully competent and  knowledgeable person, especially in view of the added danger to Bush from the  Colombian drug cartels.

headline:   U.S. COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL   
text:   I commend Rep. Levine for his call for a demonstration of "American resolve and  staying power in the pursuit of peace in the Middle East." Indeed, it has been  10 years since we assumed an assertive and activist role of the kind we  performed in securing the Camp David accords.    But to be effective, President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker must  have a broader vision of the U.S. role than Levine's. The U.S. must demonstrate  a respect for the views of Israelis and Palestinians, a commitment to the  legitimate rights of both, and a conviction that a continuation of the conflict  is abhorrent to U.S., not because of our national "interest and prestige," but  because of our basic values as a nation. These are what compel us to seek a  peace that will relieve the human suffering this conflict has imposed upon  Arabs and Jews.    Levine refers to the death of Israeli soldiers and to PLO leader Yasser  Arafat's "support for the odious policy of killing 'collaborators' resulting in  100 deaths." Although he failed to mention it, I know he must hold at least  equally odious the death of more than 600 Palestinians and the imprisonment of  thousands at the hands of Israeli military authorities.    This Administration has taken an important step: Affirming its support of  Israel, it opened the dialogue with the PLO. This move and the intifada itself  have served as a catalyst in creating a fresh opportunity for progress, and in  eliciting the Israeli proposal for elections in the West Bank and Gaza.    Yes, this is a time for a diplomacy of action. But there is no need to do it  alone. Egypt, the Soviet Union, and others can make a valuable contribution, as  Sweden has already, and should not be excluded. The urgency of this historical  moment calls for a more embracing view of the possibilities.    RABBI LEONARD I.    BEERMAN    Los Angeles

headline:   A LAW CAN'T DO IT ALL   
text:   Legislation signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian will not, in itself,  resolve the long battle over the City of Los Angeles' water diversions from the  Mono Lake Basin on the east side of the Sierra Nevada 300 miles from Los  Angeles.    Before that can happen, the city Department of Water and Power and the private  nonprofit Mono Lake Committee must find other sources of water to replace the  supply that the city would relinquish in order to halt the 50-year drain on the  unique lake. Then the parties must apply to the state for the use of a  $60-million fund to buy the alternate supplies, or perhaps finance conservation  projects.    The city and the Mono Lake Committee, in fact, have been working with the  Environmental Defense Fund for some time to find other water, possibly excess  irrigation water in California's San Joaquin Valley. The legislation by  Assemblymen Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) and William P. Baker (R-Danville)  formalizes that process in state law.    But the two bills do something far more important: Through state legislation,  they begin to implement the public trust doctrine of water use in California,  which was recognized for the first time by the California Supreme Court in a  1983 case involving Mono Lake brought by the National Audubon Society and the  Mono Lake Committee. Until that time, Los Angeles' right to divert water from  Mono Basin streams that naturally flow into Mono Lake was considered virtually  inviolate under the old Western water doctrine of appropriative rights. Under  this rule, the first person to divert the water obtained the water right.    But the Supreme Court said such water rights were not absolute. The court held  that Los Angeles' right had to be balanced by public trust interests such as  water needed to maintain fish, wildlife and recreational uses of the lake and  the streams that feed it. Meanwhile, the city has lost other suits that  restrict Mono stream diversions in order to protect the lake.    The public trust doctrine was the driving force behind the Isenberg-Baker laws,  along with common sense and the reality of public concern for the environment.  And the legislation carried the idea one logical step further: If this water is  taken from the city in the interest of the public, the public should compensate  the city -- or if not all the public, then a substantial segment of it.    The Mono Lake fund was created with money owed to the state by contractors of  the State Water Project who serve a majority of California's 28 million  residents. The $65 million will offset Los Angeles' loss only for a relatively  few years, but another important principle has been established.    There are two ways to look at the Mono Lake situation. On one hand, it has  seemed to take forever to get Los Angeles, the courts and Legislature to halt  an environmental wrong. On the other hand, California water law has undergone a  radical revolution in the direction of environmental protection in just six  short years. In the case of Mono Lake, there is considerable truth in both  statements.

headline:   AT LAST . . .   
text:   Los Angeles County officials are at last moving to reorganize the  administration of Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. Time will  determine whether they have moved fast enough to preserve the federal and state  funding that are essential to the operation.    The reorganization seems to have come reluctantly and belatedly, as much as a  year after facts had made clear that the hospital was not meeting basic  standards and that patients' lives were at risk. Indeed, the central action of  the reform, transferring the administrator, reportedly was weighed months ago  but abandoned in the face of community support for the incumbent. Now there  will be an interim administrator while a national search is conducted for a  permanent leader.    The action followed word from the U.S. Health Care Finance Administration that  the hospital would lose about $60 million in annual federal funding effective  Dec. 21 unless the egregious problems at the hospital had been corrected.    That warning came after state officials had uncovered serious defects in all of  the major areas of operation, indicating a deplorable breakdown in supervision  and administration. The county will respond to the state report on Friday and  to the federal report within two weeks. Those responses will measure the  seriousness of the reform plan.    In the meantime, the audit inspection unit of the County Department of Health  Services is completing an internal investigation, with a report promised within  two weeks. Unfortunately, the county appears to be resisting bringing in  expert, independent, outside professionals to monitor the reform process. Dist.  Atty. Ira Reiner is on record as favoring expansion of the Board of  Supervisors' own investigation to include medical and health-care experts  outside the County Department of Health Services. California abounds with  nationally recognized authorities in all of the affected areas. Their expertise  needs to be mobilized, and quickly.    The special meeting of the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday was called because  county officials "have known for a long time that there are operational  problems at King -- that it's not just a funding problem, but that there's a  need for a shift and change in management," according to the senior deputy of  Supervisor Pete Schabarum. That's an extraordinary admission, seeming to  confirm the earlier finding of state investigators that the supervisors had  failed in their legally mandated responsibility to supervise the hospital and  assure its quality.    The medical center is one of the most important links in the fragile  health-care system of the county. Its staff includes many outstanding  professionals who have served there at personal sacrifice and with distinction.  Their commitment, and the commitment of the hospital to provide quality care to  South Central Los Angeles have been betrayed by those who have failed to  provide prudent, appropriate leadership and supervision and support.

headline:   LIVES, RESEARCH HINGE ON LIMITING NEW AIDS DRUG;    FREE ACCESS ONLY FOR THE DESPERATELY ILL   
text:   A landmark medical experiment is about to begin: A new, unproven drug will be  provided to thousands of people who desperately need it while research is  conducted on its safety and effectiveness.    This "parallel track" of research and simultaneous free drug distribution of  the drug is the result of immense pressure from AIDS activists to make  experimental drugs available as early as possible. The program will, however,  still have an important limit, one that must be accepted for the "parallel  track" experiment to work: The drug will be made available only to those who  definitely need it, and not to all those who might want it.    The experimental drug, DDI, will be made available to people who are unable to  benefit from the only approved AIDS anti-virus drug, AZT. The first people to  receive DDI will be those with AIDS or AIDS-related symptoms who get too sick  from AZT to tolerate it. Around the same time, it is expected that the new drug  will also be given to people who are taking AZT but are still getting sick, as  shown by opportunistic infections, progressive weight loss, severe fatigue and  so on.    There will be thousands of others who are likely to want DDI -- people who have  decided that AZT is too toxic to take without trying it, and those who are  doing well on AZT but mistakenly believe that DDI has been proven to be a  superior drug. These people will not be able to get DDI, at least until more  research is completed.    This decision to limit an experimental drug to those who need it is a wise and  important one. DDI has been tested on fewer than 100 people. These studies  suggest that over a short term, DDI is less toxic than AZT. However, we do not  have adequate information about long-term side effects.    More important, there is no solid information about whether DDI is as effective  as, or more or less effective than, AZT. Indeed, limited information from the  manufacturer suggests it may be somewhat less effective.    But the fundamental question is: Why shouldn't people who want the drug be  allowed to have it? Shouldn't people with a life-threatening illness be given  any hope they want?    There is no doubt that people who are sick and cannot tolerate AZT, or are  getting sick in spite of AZT, need DDI as their only current hope. But for the  others, a proven alternative is available. AZT does prolong life and keep many  people productive, and at the lower doses now advised, its toxicity appears  much less than before.    Still, the question persists: Why shouldn't people be allowed to choose? The  answer is both practical and philosophical.    Realistically, if an experimental drug were available to anyone who wanted it,  there would be little incentive for people to enter research studies, and  without studies proving a drug safe and effective, it could not be approved by  the Food and Drug Administration and then marketed. Instead, the drug company  would have to provide the drug free to thousands of people. (An FDA physician  estimates that it costs up to $5,000 per patient per year to provide a drug for  free -- and that is just the administrative cost; it does not include the cost  of the drug itself.) Obviously, if a drug can not be marketed, there will be no  incentive for the company to continue its free distribution.    Indeed, if that were to happen to DDI, the prototype of the parallel-track  experiment, and the drug were not marketed, it is highly probable that other  drug companies would be discouraged from undertaking research on drugs for AIDS  and other life-threatening diseases. That decision would be a disaster for  millions of Americans.    Finally, how can people decide that DDI is a better choice for them than AZT?  At this point, the answer is they cannot decide -- we simply do not know. That  is why research is so critical. That is how we learned that AZT works, and that  aerosolized pentamidine prevents the most common pneumonia seen in AIDS. It is  also how we learned about two previously highly touted drugs -- suramin was too  toxic and dextran sulfate was not absorbed, so it was of no benefit. But if all  these and other "promising" drugs were made widely available, no one would have  adequate information to make an intelligent choice about what drug or drugs to  take.    Society often assumes a responsibility for protecting people from potentially  dangerous situations. Thus we tolerate seat-belt laws, speed limits and the  requirement that drugs be proven safe and effective before they are made widely  available. That is acceptable and wise.    To completely do away with regulations that protect people from unproven drugs  would lead to chaos and many unnecessary deaths. Even if the right to choose  were granted, people would not have sufficient information to make an  intelligent choice among untested drugs. So research and appropriate  regulations must be protected.    For people with no option -- people for whom AZT cannot do what it has done and  is doing for others -- DDI must be made immediately available. For the others,  AZT should be taken until we know more about DDI. And AIDS activists should be  proud of the changes they have wrought.

headline:   INDEX THE GAINS TAX; DON'T CUT IT   
text:   After focusing for months on extraneous arguments about revenue effects  (probably zero) and fairness (a red herring), the capital gains debate has  taken a politically bizarre twist. The Democratic-controlled House is about to  vote on a very Republican capital gains measure that would cut the capital  gains tax rate to 19.6% for two years, then index capital gains to inflation.    By insisting on two years of a "differential" lower capital gains tax rate, the  bill, authored by Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.), risks seeing the two years stretch  on indefinitely through the actions of rate-cut supporters. And by rejecting a  superior alternative plan to index capital gains for inflation right away, the  Ways and Means Committee has jeopardized passage of any capital gains measure.    Indexing, which would exempt from taxes any profits up to the level of  inflation, is best on economic grounds. It looks as if it would be better  politics as well, in view of opposition to the Jenkins bill by powerful  Democrats like House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Senate Finance Committee  Chairman Lloyd Bentsen.    Indexing capital gains on new investment, as Ways and Means Committee Chairman  Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) originally proposed, avoids the harmful effects of  taxing illusory inflation gains and eliminates the fairness issue, since it  means that taxpayers, whatever their bracket, will see their capital gains  taxed as ordinary income.    Ironically, the primary opposition to indexing capital gains comes from a small  segment of the business community that claims that indexing does not provide  adequate incentives for high-risk investors. Says former Rep. Edward Zchau, now  a high-tech executive in California, "in order to inspire patient, long-term  risk capital, you have to go further" than indexing capital gains. "Going  further" means cutting the tax rate on unindexed gains to 15% or 20%.    This opposition to indexing represents part of a long tradition of business  community opposition to tax measures that turn out to be highly beneficial.  When President John F. Kennedy in 1961 proposed a "radical" measure to spur  investment with the investment tax credit, business reaction was almost  uniformly negative. One accountant termed the proposal "vague, uncertain in  application . . . its effect on revenue is doubtful and unpredictable." Of  course, once it was understood, the investment tax credit became one of the  most popular tax measures ever enjoyed by business.    The argument for a differential capital gains rate of 15% or 20% instead of  indexing capital gains comes down to a claim that the differential rate is  necessary to provide adequate rewards for risky ventures.    Most economists, not to mention many venture capitalists, agree that the market  already provides adequate compensation for additional risks. For example,  during the 1951-88 period, for five-year holding periods, investors in the  stock market who switched from less-risky S&amp;P 500 companies to riskier  smaller companies increased their average return by 373% (from 3.05% to 11.37%)  while the most common measure of risk rose by only 50% (from 7.31% to 10.93%.)    By far the oddest thing about venture capitalists and other commentators on  capital gains is their failure to examine carefully the question of whether  they would be better off with differential capital gains rates or indexing.  Indexing wins hands down. When it comes to reducing uncertainty about the  after-tax real return on an investment, indexing means that an investor is  relieved of having to forecast the inflation rate to calculate the return. This  is not true with a differential capital gains rate, which, once fixed, can  leave the investor with inadequate or excessive protection against inflation.    Most important, indexing actually results in a lower tax rate on capital gains  than the proposed 19.6% rate. For five-year investments, given a typical 4%  inflation rate, indexing beats a 20% capital gains tax rate for projects with  assumed annual real returns of up to nearly 20%. In short, indexing is the best  way to reward the longer-term investments favored by Treasury Secretary  Nicholas F. Brady. The longer an investment is held, the more gains accrue from  deferral of tax, while indexing protects against erosion of real returns by  inflation.    The Rostenkowski proposal even included an option whereby after five years,  investors could choose between inflation indexing and being taxed on only 75%  of the selling price of the asset. This option means that if, after five years,  you have a project that earns more than a 32% annual real return, you would be  better off under his alternative. The cost is minimal because only a tiny  fraction of investment projects would consistently yield real returns over five  years of more then 30%. But if the alternative made some venture capitalists  feel better, more power to them.    Indexing capital gains was part of the Treasury's original landmark tax reform  proposal that ultimately led to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Let's hope that  Congress can regroup on a sound policy to index capital gains and that the  President will recognize indexing as a valuable modification to the tax code  that will do more to encourage investment than any other measure.

text:   The principals of four San Diego County schools that were selected for the 1989  National School Recognition Program will travel to Washington to receive awards  Thursday from President Bush and Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos.    The schools to be honored are Mt. Carmel High School in Poway, Vista High  School, Oak Grove Middle School in Jamul and Valley Center Middle School.    "San Diego County did exceptionally well in this competition," county Supt. of  Schools Thomas C. Boysen said. "I'm pleased that our county will be  well-represented at the White House."    More than 500 public secondary schools throughout the nation were nominated for  the awards. The field was finally narrowed to 176 winners from 42 states.  California led the nation with 24 winners.    The awards were made based on test scores, teaching practices and levels of  parent and community involvement. In addition, each nominated school received a  two-day visit last spring by a team from the U. S. Department of Education. The  review teams interviewed students, parents and teachers, and analyzed  educational records.

headline:   SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO   
text:   An Escondido man arrested Friday in the Central Valley on suspicion of killing  a woman admitted committing the crime to two people, according to court  records.    Filomeno C. Huerta, 23, pleaded innocent Monday to murder in the the Sept. 5  slaying of Sylvia Flores, 23, also of Escondido, whose body was discovered in a  drainage ditch Sept. 16 in the 14100 block of San Pasqual Road.    Huerta was arrested Friday in Kingsburg and brought to San Diego on Sunday by  homicide detectives.    According to a declaration by San Diego Police Detective Richard Thwing, Huerta  admitted killing the woman to the two people, who later contacted police. Both  said that Huerta told them they would be killed if they ever told police about  what he had said.    One of the two said he saw blood on Huerta's face, pants and shirt Sept. 5, the  day of the killing. Huerta told that person, according to the declaration, that  he stabbed Flores but that the knife bent, so he then dragged her to the side  of the road and hit her with a large rock.    On Sept. 7, Huerta and the witness drove near the location of the body, where  Huerta allegedly pointed to where he had left it, the declaration says. That  witness later led Escondido police to the site where the body was recovered.    According to Thwing, a broken concrete block with blood on it and a bloody rock  were found nearby. At another location, police found a bent knife with  bloodstains.    Bail was set at $1 million by San Diego Municipal Judge Frank Brown. A  preliminary hearing was scheduled for Oct. 11.

headline:   GAS LEAK SENDS 20 PACOIMA STUDENTS, TEACHER'S AIDE TO HOSPITALS   
text:   Natural gas escaping from a ruptured pipeline in Pacoima drifted onto the  campus of a nearby junior high school early Tuesday, temporarily halting  classes and sending 20 students and a teacher's aide to hospitals with  complaints of eye irritation and nausea, authorities said.    Students and teachers at Charles Maclay Junior High School first noticed the  smell shortly before 9 a.m., about 45 minutes after school had started,  Principal Leonard George said. School officials called the Los Angeles Fire  Department and directed students to leave their classrooms and gather on  athletic fields, he said.    "The smell was very strong," George said.    The 20 students who complained of nausea and other ailments were examined by  paramedics and taken to three nearby hospitals for observation, George said.  All were released to their parents by early afternoon, hospital representatives  said.    A teacher's aide who is six months pregnant was transferred to the AMI Tarzana  Regional Medical Center for 24-hour observation, authorities said.    A contractor's crew working about 1 1/2 miles south of the school accidentally  cut a section of 12-inch pipe in the 10200 block of Glenoaks Boulevard shortly  before 8 a.m., said Vicki Cho, Southern California Gas Co. spokeswoman.  Pressurized natural gas escaped for about an hour, causing temporary evacuation  of about a dozen businesses in the largely industrial area along Glenoaks, Cho  said.    "Our crews shut off the gas at about 9 a.m.," Cho said. "We got a few calls  from customers in the area complaining about the odor. It's not harmful once it  is dissipated in the atmosphere."    Cho said the weather -- hot, humid and smoggy -- may have made the smell worse.  "When it's like this, odors just hang," she said.

headline:   DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTIES RULED JUSTIFIED IN KILLING SUICIDAL MAN   
text:   The actions of three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were justified when  they fatally shot a suicidal man who charged at one of them with a claw-ended  gardening tool, the district attorney's office concluded Tuesday.    The independent investigation of the May 18 death of Lawrence Watts, 31,  concluded that Deputies Mark Richardson, James Vetrovec and Mario Carrillo  acted in self-defense of Richardson, a letter from the district attorney's  office to the Sheriff's Department said.    Watts was shot in the parking lot of the Antelope Valley Medical Center after  leading deputies on a two-hour, low-speed pursuit through Lancaster following  an attempted traffic stop. After Watts finally stopped his pickup truck in the  parking lot, he got out holding a bloody spading claw and making a growling  sound, the letter said.    Watts ignored several shouted orders to freeze and charged at Richardson, the  letter said. All three deputies opened fire on Watts and he was killed.    "He gave every indication that he was dangerous and unpredictable," said the  letter written by Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth R. Freeman. "This was genuinely an  emergency situation. Based upon the available evidence, it appears that at the  time Deputies Richardson, Vetrovec and Carrillo fired their weapons, they  reasonably believed that Mr. Watts was attempting to seriously injure or kill  Deputy Richardson."    Investigators learned after the shooting that Watts had slashed his wrists with  the spading claw during the pursuit.    The district attorney's letter said Watts had been released three weeks earlier  from a hospital where he was treated for being depressed, suicidal and  psychotic.

headline:   DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OVERTURNS ENCINO RESTAURANT'S DISCO PLAN   
text:   Encino homeowners persuaded a Los Angeles City Council planning committee  Tuesday to overturn a zoning board decision and prevent a Ventura Boulevard  restaurant from opening a disco.    A.J.'s Supper Club had applied for permission to add a small dance floor to its  restaurant and bar at 17337 Ventura Blvd., operating until midnight weekdays  and 1 a.m. weekends. A city zoning administrator had denied that application,  but the Board of Zoning Appeals overruled the administrator's decision.    Speaking before the Planning and Land Use Management Committee on Tuesday,  residents of adjacent neighborhoods said there already are at least four  establishments within a block of A.J.'s that offer late-night dancing.    Neighbor Emanuel Sedacca said patrons "get a head start" by drinking while  waiting in line to enter the clubs. One more disco would be too much to bear,  he said.    Committee members voted unanimously to support the neighbors' appeal and deny  the dance floor proposal. The issue is scheduled to go Oct. 11 to the full City  Council.

headline:   L.A. LIABLE FOR LOPEZ CANYON ODORS;    SMALL CLAIMS RULING AWARDS $501 TO DUMP'S NEIGHBOR   
text:   A San Fernando small claims court judge Tuesday ordered the city of Los Angeles  to pay a Kagel Canyon resident $501 in damages for noxious gases blown into his  home from the nearby Lopez Canyon Landfill, a decision the disgruntled neighbor  said will encourage dozens more such lawsuits.    Municipal Court Judge Pro Tem Robert Keimach ordered the city Bureau of  Sanitation to pay Rob Zapple, a critic of Lopez Canyon, $1 for suffering, and  $500 in punitive damages for failing to install a gas collection system that  would prevent the fumes from drifting into the nearby residential neighborhood.    A jubilant Zapple, who claimed that his home and environment had been harmed by  foul-smelling gases from the landfill, hailed the decision and said that as  many as 100 more Kagel Canyon residents may file similar small claims suits in  order to bring pressure on the Bureau of Sanitation to close the landfill.      Not Binding on Others    Keimach pointed out, however, that Zapple's victory "means absolutely nothing  on future lawsuits, because it is not binding on any other judges or on any  other cases I might hear."    In 1981, 116 homeowners near the San Francisco Airport filed small claims  lawsuits against the city of San Francisco, claiming that noise from the  airport caused them undue suffering. They won damages, prompting more lawsuits  from other neighbors.    Eventually, Zapple said, their efforts led officials to close two runways  during night hours.    It was a small legal victory for Lopez Canyon opponents on the same day when  the city won a major legal battle in defense of the dump. A Los Angeles  Superior Court judge barred state officials from scaling back trash dumping at  the landfill, saying the state had based its order on a vague and outdated  document.    But Zapple, carrying on the fight by the dump's neighbors, said he hopes the  strategy of many small lawsuits will persuade city officials to close the Lopez  Canyon Landfill rather than expand it, because foul odors "inundate the  neighborhood on an ever more increasing basis."    "This is the first time that the courts have upheld that the landfill has been  an ongoing public nuisance, that they are defiling our environment," Zapple  said. "This is a major victory for our community -- it shows the city cannot  run willy-nilly over us."    However, Deputy City Atty. Chris Westhoff, who represents the Bureau of  Sanitation, said the bureau will appeal the decision to Superior Court.    "That is a ridiculous ruling," Westhoff said. "We are obviously going to  appeal. I have no doubt that we will win."    But he conceded that city officials could spend many hours in court if Kagel  Canyon residents do file many small claims suits. "If they want to spend their  time doing that, we will spend our time defending it," Westhoff said.      $2,000 Sought    Zapple won only a fraction of the $2,000 in damages he sought from the city  because he failed to prove his contention that the fumes were a health hazard  -- a contention which Bureau of Sanitation engineer Edward Ostrowski denied.    "It has never been shown that Lopez Canyon is a public health hazard,"  Ostrowski said.    However Keimach said he felt Zapple's living conditions had been harmed by the  fumes, and said he fined officials because "the city had not acted properly"  after residents began complaining.

headline:   DISCLOSING HOMEOWNER MEMBERSHIPS   
text:   An article about light rail on Sept. 10 quoted Richard Close, president of the  Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., and Gerald Silver, president of Homeowners of  Encino. Many articles regarding growth issues quote representatives of  homeowners groups. My difficulty is in understanding whom these various  representatives represent.    For example, as a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee for the  Ventura/Cahuenga Specific Plan, I served with Mr. Silver. While one must  respect his strongly held convictions and his ability to obtain substantial  press coverage in their furtherance, one must question whether his convictions  are more his own than those of a community.    This is especially true in Encino, where more than one organization claims to  represent homeowners.    Requiring homeowner associations to make public their paid memberships would  allow the comments of an individual such as Mr. Silver to be given their proper  weight. Logically, the only homeowner groups that should object to making this  information public would be those that have limited membership. Imagine the  difference in importance if Mr. Silver represented 25 households as opposed to  500 or 5,000.    I also believe that representatives of homeowner groups who actively lobby  within the city of Los Angeles should be required to register as lobbyists. As  chairman of the Business Property Council, our executive director, Tim Riley,  is required to register as a lobbyist prior to speaking on behalf of our  organization and its membership. This filing is a public disclosure as to our  organization and its membership. Representatives of homeowner groups should be  no less regulated when they are performing the same functions.

headline:   IT'S BACK TO FUTURE AS ANGEL BID ENDS   
text:   Still stuck on 89 for '89, the Angels officially began preparations for the  1990 baseball season Tuesday night.    The American League West championship they gamely pursued for more than five  months will belong in hands other than the Angels' for the 26th time in 29  years. Their 4-0 loss to Kansas City at Anaheim Stadium, coupled with Oakland's  4-3 victory over Texas, equaled elimination for the Angels on the 157th date of  their regular-season schedule.    And, cruelty upon cruelty, the home run that again torpedoed the Angels was  delivered by Dave Henderson, the anti-hero of '86, whose two-run shot up north  was the difference in the Athletics' victory over the Rangers.    Rubbed out . . . and not spared having it rubbed in.    At 89-68, the Angels are six games behind Oakland with five to play. Only  Kansas City, which remains five games back, has a mathematical chance of tying  Oakland for the title. The A's (95-62) have clinched at least a share of their  second consecutive AL West championship.    The Angels, meanwhile, squandered their fifth consecutive chance to win their  90th game. Last Wednesday, they logged victory No. 89 and haven't won since,  going 0-5 against Cleveland and Kansas City.    After a long and unlikely run -- they were tied for first place as late as Aug.  21 -- the Angels, in the end, went quietly. And that end left Manager Doug  Rader unprepared for its reality.    Or, at least, Rader refused to acknowledge it.    "I never anticipate losing and I never anticipate that tomorrow we're not in  the pennant race," Rader said. "I can't get my mind in the mind set to prepare  myself for failure."    Rader also refused to look back on the successes experienced by a team that  most expected to finish no better than fourth with no business winning 90  games.    "No reflections tonight," Rader said. "Tomorrow there will be. I need some  time."    Kirk McCaskill, Tuesday's losing pitcher, reacted much the same way.    "I'm not looking back on anything yet," said McCaskill, whose record dropped to  15-10. "We're still fighting for something, as far as I'm concerned. Second  place and possibly the second-best record in baseball means a lot, at least to  me.    "All of these things are valuable. We should always have goals. Granted, we're  not going to win this thing, but nothing was ever accomplished sitting back.    Contention ended rather predictably for the Angels. They were beaten by young  nemesis -- and AL Cy Young Award favorite -- Bret Saberhagen, who threw a  six-hitter to improve to 22-6, lower his earned-run average to 2.19 and extend  his consecutive scoreless-innings streak to 27, a Kansas City record.    By retiring pinch-hitter Jim Eppard on a fly ball to left field to complete the  shutout, Saberhagen eclipsed Roger Nelson's old Royal mark of 26 2/3 scoreless  innings, set in 1972.    So, from the Angels' vantage point, what's new? This was Saberhagen's 16th  appearance against the Angels, and with it, he won for the ninth time in 12  decisions. He is 2-0 against them this season and 5-1 at Anaheim Stadium.    "Saberhagen is something else," Rader said. "I can't imagine a better pitcher  -- anywhere -- than him right now. He was throwing 93 (m.p.h.) in the ninth  inning and still had command of all three pitches.    "He's got it all."    Seldom, however, have the Angels made it easier for Saberhagen, who led, 3-0,  before throwing his first pitch. Angel starter Kirk McCaskill didn't retire a  hitter until striking out Kurt Stillwell, the No. 7 batter in the Kansas City  lineup. Before that, McCaskill:     -- Hit leadoff man Kevin Seitzer with a pitch.     -- Yielded a looping single to left field by Willie Wilson.     -- Loaded the bases when George Brett beat out a grounder that skittered away  from Angel second baseman Johnny Ray.     -- Surrendered a two-run broken-bat single to Bo Jackson.     -- Gave up another infield single, this bouncing off the glove of shortstop  Kent Anderson, to Jim Eisenreich.     -- Gave up a run-scoring single to left field by Danny Tartabull.    To that point, the only out McCaskill had recorded was at second base, when  Angel catcher Lance Parrish erased Jackson on a stolen-base try.    So at that point, Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann left the dugout to  offer McCaskill a few words of advice.    McCaskill promptly settled down -- he retired the next 12 hitters -- but by  then, Saberhagen was entrenched.    Saberhagen was in trouble only once, in the fifth inning, when Lance Parrish  led off with a single and Jack Howell then hit a double to left field.    With runners on second and third and no outs, Saberhagen got two in a hurry  when Anderson hit a bouncer to Brett at first base. Brett scooped up the ball  and stepped on the bag for one out, then watched as Parrish made a belated  break for home.    On the run, Brett fired an off-balance throw to catcher Bob Boone, who made the  tag on Parrish for a threat-killing double play. Saberhagen retired the next  batter, Brian Downing, on a ground ball to shortstop and was out of the inning.    Twelve outs later, the Angels were also out of time. Five games are left on  their schedule, but the next one that really counts for anything will be played  early next April.    Angel Notes    So, what's left for the Angels to play for? With a 4-2 final home stand, the  Angels would tie the club record for most victories in a season, 93, set by the  1982 American League West champions. With a 3-3 home stand, the Angels would  equal the franchise record for most victories at home, 53, set in 1967. . . .  The Angels' Johnny Ray and Kansas City's George Brett both ended protracted  batting slumps with first-inning singles. Ray was one for 18 before singling  off Bret Saberhagen, and Brett was one for 21 before beating out an infield hit  against Kirk McCaskill.    A'S ASSURED OF TIE    Oakland Athletics clinch at least a tie for their second straight AL West  title. Story Page 3.

headline:   DEYNA DRINKING HEAVILY AT TIME OF FATAL ACCIDENT   
text:   Kaz Deyna, a member of five Socker championship teams, had a blood-alcohol  level twice the legal limit when he crashed into a parked truck and died on  Sept. 1, the San Diego County Coroner's Office said Tuesday.    Deyna had a blood-alcohol level of .20%, said Max Murphy, the supervising  deputy at the coroner's office. California law recognizes .10 as the legal  limit.    "You can be assured that the guy was doing some heavy drinking," said Lloyd  Needham, a public affairs officer for the California Highway Patrol in San  Diego. Deyna, 41, had a history of drunk driving. He was convicted three times  of driving under the influence following arrests on Aug. 7, 1984, May 14, 1987  and Oct. 29, 1987, according to San Diego Municipal Court records.    For two of the convictions, he was given 180-day jail sentences, which were  both suspended after two days. His license was temporarily suspended after the  third conviction, but, according to state Department of Motor Vehicles records,  he was driving legally at the time of the accident.    Deyna, a native of Poland and a member of Poland's 1972 Olympic gold-medal  team, was pronounced dead at the scene. The accident occurred about 1:25 a.m.  on Interstate 15 north of Mira Mesa Boulevard. The coroner's report said Deyna,  who was driving alone, died of massive head injuries. According to the CHP  report, the hazard lights of the truck, which was parked on the right shoulder,  were blinking, and there were no skid marks from Deyna's car.    Two weeks before his death, Deyna was in Europe participating in an all-star  exhibition game with the Polish national team against Denmark. Juli Veee, a  former Socker teammate of Deyna's who saw him frequently during the past year,  said returning from the trip might have depressed Deyna.    "He went back and he was Kaz Deyna the star again," Veee said. "I don't care  what anybody says, it's tough to lose the notoriety when you're at the top and  suddenly you're driving down Mira Mesa Boulevard and nobody even knows you."    Veee said he was aware of Deyna's drinking, but that Deyna seemed to have it  under control.    "I wasn't worried about the drinking too much, because in Europe a lot of  players drink," Veee said. "Some people would say 'The hell with him. He was an  alcoholic.' No, he liked his drinks. He could handle it. He was never drunk in  the games. I think he knew what his limit was. Maybe this time he just didn't  know."    Deyna, a Socker from 1981-87, publicly expressed his displeasure with the team  during his final season, when he played sparingly.

headline:   MORNING BRIEFING: THESE CUB FANS HAVE SAID IT ALL ALONG: YOU GOTTA BELIZE   
text:   It's not exactly a cargo cult, but William Branigan of the Washington Post  reports that residents of the Central American country of Belize are going  bonkers for the Chicago Cubs:    "Through a quirk of geography and satellite technology, Belize has more Cub  fans per capita than any place outside greater Chicago, residents say.    "It started in 1981, when local businessman Arthur Hoare introduced television  to Belize (population 180,000), the only English-speaking country in Central  America. Many Belizeans already had television sets by then, but used them to  watch rented videotapes. The enterprising Hoare capitalized on the ready market  by launching Channel 9, which captured Chicago's WGN station on a satellite  dish and relayed it to local viewers."    Then aren't the broadcasts pirated?    "U.S. broadcasters consider the Belize market so small that trying to stop the  operations would not be worth the trouble."    According to Branigan, Belizeans take the view that, as one resident put it,  "Out of the sky we get sunshine, we get rain and we get TV signals. Whatever  drops out of the sky is an act of God."    Crying wolf: Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, once known for his quick wit, has  developed a new image -- that of a hand-wringing poor-mouth.    After his top-ranked Irish had defeated Michigan State Saturday, Holtz moaned  about Notre Dame's next opponent, Purdue. It was his understanding, Holtz said,  that the Boilermakers had beaten Notre Dame whenever the Irish were reigning  national champions. Sorry, Lou, no sympathy.    KMPC radio's Jim Healy, based on research by sports expert Dwain Esper,  informed his audience Monday night that in nine seasons after Notre Dame  championships, Purdue has won three times, the Irish have won three and three  times the teams didn't play.    Trivia time: On Sept. 27, 1936, what future Dodger manager played in his only  major league game?    Strictly business: The Boston Red Sox unceremoniously made it clear Monday that  former stars Jim Rice, 36, and Bob Stanley, 34, won't be in Red Sox uniforms  next year. Both are in final years of long-term contracts that included club  options for 1990. Rice earns $2.34 million for this season, Stanley $1 million.    Asked what the Red Sox plan to do with the money they save on the contracts,  General Manager Lou Gorman told Steve Buckley of the Hartford Courant: "A lot  of it will go to Mr. Esasky, if we can sign him."    First baseman Nick Esasky will become a free agent at the end of the season.    Trivia answer: Walter Alston, as a late-inning substitute at first base for  Johnny Mize of the St. Louis Cardinals. Alston made one error in two chances  and struck out in his only time at bat.

text:   The St. Louis Cardinals exited the National League East race with customary  silence from their bats.    The Cardinals, who struggled to overcome injuries all season, were eliminated  Tuesday night from the race as they lost to Pittsburgh, 4-1, while Chicago beat  Montreal to clinch the division title.    St. Louis' loss clinched a tie for the Cubs, and Chicago finished the job a  little later with a 3-2 victory over the Expos at Olympic Stadium.    The Cardinals are 11-43 when they score three or fewer runs.    "We just didn't score enough," Manager Whitey Herzog said. "You look at the  three teams that were in it and faded, it was the same thing. The Mets,  Montreal and us, we just didn't score enough."    Herzog showed no emotion as the Cardinals' hopes faded. He dug into his usual  plate of postgame food.    "I've had a lot of years when I didn't win it," he said.    Herzog pointed to last weekend as the time when the race turned. The Cardinals  swept the Phillies but gained no ground on the Cubs, who took three games from  the Pirates.    "That was the whole key to our chances," Herzog said. "We had to get some help  there."    "It seemed like every time we won, they won," third baseman Terry Pendleton  said. "We'd lose and they'd lose. And then we didn't help ourselves."    The Cardinals lost 12 of 17 games to fifth-place Pittsburgh this season.    Bob Patterson (4-2) gave up four hits in eight innings, and Bill Landrum got  the last three outs for his 26th save.    "If you keep their speed off the bases you have a chance to win," Patterson  said.    The Cardinals stayed close throughout the season despite playing without  injured starting pitchers Danny Cox and Greg Mathews.    Bobby Bonilla, who has 11 extra base hits and has scored 10 runs in his last 13  games, tripled and doubled and scored twice for Pittsburgh.

headline:   CANUCKS MAKE IT A LONG NIGHT FOR KINGS AND HRUDEY   
text:   It was a long, tough night for goalie Kelly Hrudey, who gave up four goals  before he was felled by a puck to the face mask in the third period, and later  gave up one more goal in the Kings' 6-3 exhibition loss to the Vancouver  Canucks Tuesday night before a crowd of 12,320.    After the Canucks' first four goals, Mike Krushelnyski scored for the Kings  with less than two minutes to play in the second period. Vancouver responded  with another goal, before the Kings made it 5-3 on Krushelnyski's goal from the  right circle and Luc Robitaille's goal, after Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean made  a glove save on a shot by Wayne Gretzky.    The Canucks later scored on an empty-net goal.    King Notes    The Kings, whose exhibition record is 2-4-2, will play the Vancouver Canucks  again Thursday night at Phoenix. The game will be broadcast on KLAC (570) at  7:30 p.m. . . . The Kings' Barry Beck played in his first game since retiring  from the New York Rangers two years ago.

headline:   ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;    HAVERT A SOFT TOUCH AFTER 6 SCORES   
text:   Although it might seem ludicrous to the Calabasas High defense, Colin Havert  claims that he has a soft spot.    To be sure, there are no soft spots on Havert's 6-foot, 200-pound, diamond-hard  frame. But Chaminade's senior tailback has a soft spot in his heart.    That's why Chaminade's final touchdown in a 48-0 thumping of Calabasas last  Friday hurt him more than it hurt Calabasas.    It was his sixth, yes, sixth touchdown of the game. "My last one was sorta  getting old because I didn't really expect to get back in the game," he said.  "And when I did it was like, 'All right, here's another one.' I was a little  embarrassed."    Havert has nothing to be embarrassed about, Coach Rich Lawson says. Havert  gained 183 yards in 15 carries and scored on runs of two, 33, one, 32, one, and  26 yards. That places him in a third-place tie for most touchdowns in a  Southern Section game. The record is eight.    And Lawson insists that this was not a case of pouring it on. Every player on  the Eagles' roster played and the coach reasoned that keeping Havert in the  game actually reduced the likelihood of injuries to his offense.    "I don't have any depth," Lawson said. "On offense, if guys don't know the  blocking scheme and they're running back and forth, then you're really going to  create an injury."    Chaminade had already sustained a major blow, losing All-Southern Section  defensive back Jeff Burdick, who broke his leg and tore ankle ligaments on the  fourth play of the game. Burdick, who also starts at receiver, was injured  after catching a pass.    After that, Havert had to shoulder the bulk of the Chaminade offense. He also  played linebacker on a defense that limited Calabasas to 111 yards passing and  30 on the ground.    Against hard-hitting and heavily favored Palmdale, he scored three touchdowns  in a 35-14 rout. His performance against Calabasas gives him 379 yards in 50  carries (a 7.6-yard average) and also earned him recognition as the National  Football Foundation's Player of the Week for the San Fernando Valley.    The molar-rattling blows Havert took in the Palmdale game prepared him for what  might have been similar treatment from the Coyotes. Instead, he found open  space. Lots of it.    "Calabasas had some real big kids," he said. "I was ready to pound it out and I  lowered my head. But the holes were wide open every time."    In addition to the Eagles' offensive line, give credit to Felix Goodson, a  utility back who alternately spells Havert and fullback Ted Corcoran. Goodson  noticed a weakness in the Calabasas defense and spied a way to spring Havert  with a kick-out block on a blitzing linebacker.    The play didn't work on the first try. Havert failed to cut to the sideline  quickly enough and was tackled after a short gain.    Before Havert's next carry, Goodson drew him the suggested path in the air and  pointed to the hole before the snap. Havert took the handoff, blasted into the  gap, squirted to the sideline and ran 42 yards before he was accidentally  knocked down by a teammate.    But it was the 32-yard touchdown run that most impressed Lawson. Starting from  the right hash mark, Havert took the handoff, juked three times to the left,  then crossed the goal line at the left corner of the end zone.    "Hey, not only can this guy bruise but he can cut back," Lawson said. "I've  been telling people all year that he's really underrated, but like I told  Colin, 'You just let your feet do the talking.' "

headline:   ART BUCHWALD: A TEAMSTER'S GIANT STAKES OUT HIS TURF   
text:   It was in all the papers. A mobster told Playboy magazine that Jimmy Hoffa, the  former Teamster Union boss, was buried on the 20-yard line at the Giants'  stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands.    The thug, a government-protected witness, stated that after Hoffa was  dispatched in Detroit, his remains were placed in an oil drum and shipped east.  The drum was laid in the soft Meadowlands ground as support for the artificial  turf.    The news came as a surprise to some sports fans who hang out at Clyde's in  Georgetown.    Don Rogers said, "I thought Hoffa was buried on the highway between Grand  Rapids and Kalamazoo."    "Nah," answered Steve Wells. "A friend of mine assured me his remains were  under the starting gate at Hialeah. Hoffa liked horses."    Bob Boyd added, "The thing that makes me doubt the Playboy story is that Jimmy  Hoffa was a Detroit Lions fan. Why would he want to be buried in New Jersey?"    "Maybe he didn't have any choice," Jim Norton suggested. "Perhaps they buried  Hoffa in New Jersey to punish him."    "I never thought of that. Teamster gorillas can be insensitive. But why the  20-yard line?" I asked.    Rogers explained, "That's where all the action is. It's much more lively than  the end zone."    Wells was shaking his head. "It just doesn't figure. The Giants are not that  good a team."    Bob Boyd said, "There could be other factors. Don't forget that at the time  they buried Hoffa in the Meadowlands Stadium, they were installing artificial  turf. By burying him there, look at all the money the Teamsters saved on upkeep  of the grave. The Teamster enforcers are always looking for ways to put a  little extra into their pension fund."    "Is it possible that the Playboy story is a red herring, and Hoffa is really  buried in Yankee Stadium at home plate?" I asked.    "That doesn't make any sense. Why would they bury him there?" Rogers wanted to  know.    "That's where George Steinbrenner buried 4,600 Yankee managers. So the Mob  might have thought that no one would look for Hoffa in that location," Wells  told him.    "It's too farfetched. I believe the mobster's story that Hoffa is now in a drum  in the Giants' ballpark," Boyd declared.    "If that is true, it gives new meaning to the phrase 'sudden death,' " Wells  said.    "You know what would be nice. If we all went up to the Meadowlands and strewed  flowers on the Giants' 20-yard line," I suggested.    "While they were playing!" exclaimed Norton.    "It would be more touching," Rogers said.    "You've got to show me something other than the Playboy article before I'll  believe that Jimmy Hoffa is resting in the Meadowlands. He could be anywhere --  even under the Dallas Cowboys' locker room," Norton told us.    "They would never bury Hoffa in Dallas," Rogers asserted.    "Why not?" I asked.    "The Cowboys don't have a pass defense."    There was no consensus at Clyde's that evening on whether or not Hoffa was  really buried in the Giants' stadium. The problem, as we saw it, was that since  everything else is buried in New Jersey, why not him?

Not to be missed were paintings by Miro, Balthus, Braque  and Klee. Wilder was the epitome of cool; he drank a Heineken and mingled.    The Buzz: Art-that-got-away war stories. The Giacometti that could have been  had for $3,500, but of course that was 30 years ago. Balthuses went for a song  in the '60s and now look at them. Also, talk about the Wilder estimates. They  were insane. They were fair. The name alone made people come running.    Who Was There: A little bit Hollywood, a little bit Hancock Park.

Dress Mode: Proverbial cocktail attire, i.e. pearls and pinstripes. David  Hockney, as usual, made his own fashion statement in chinos, dirty bucks, work  shirt, blazer and red polka dota bow tie, untied.    The Food: Proverbial hors d'oevres passed on trays, i.e. mushrooms stuffed with  crabmeat, cold shrimp and cocktail sauce, steak tartare. Open bar.

headline:   NEW AND USEFUL: POSTER/CABINET CAN KEEP MUSIC BEHIND THE SCENES   
text:   An Arizona company has introduced an inconspicuous way to store compact discs  and cassettes at your home or office -- in a wall cabinet hidden behind a  framed poster.    Behind the Scenes Storage Frames are customized metal-framed posters and  storage cabinet combinations that open to reveal a music storage cabinet,  similar to a medicine cabinet. The poster "door," which is hinged to the hidden  cabinet, opens with a magnetic touch release. And the cabinet is constructed of  melamine-covered, almond-colored particle board.    The poster/cabinet combination, which protrudes only 4 3/8 inches from the  wall, comes in eight sizes. Available in horizontal and vertical, the smallest  poster sizes are 18 1/2 by 20 inches; largest, 32 1/4 by 36 inches.    The artwork ranges from museum quality to pop art, from Picasso to Nagel.  Though there are also many signed, limited edition posters available, customers  may supply their own posters or original artwork to be made into storage  cabinets.    Behind the Scenes Storage Frames for compact discs can be ordered to hold 36,  48, 54, 60, 72, 90 or 96 cases. CDs fit in clear acrylic holders -- each stores  6 -- that give you front viewing, and also swing out for a side view of the  five CDs behind.    The cabinets for cassettes can be ordered in 63, 84, 93, 105, 124, 126, 155 or  168 cases and feature shelves to store tapes vertically.    Prices for Behind the Scenes Storage Frames start at $179.95 for CDs; $139.95  for cassettes. To order, contact Parallel Productions, 919 W. Mission Drive,  Chandler, Ariz. 85224; phone, (602) 899-8057.    Get a Handle on Grocery Bags    A new handle to help shoppers carry more than one plastic bag at a time without  hurting their hands is so simple it's a wonder no one thought of it before.    Grocery Tote, designed by Eric Stoft and Bill Cloonan of Sylmar, is a  heavy-duty blue plastic handle with hooks at each end to keep the shopping  bags' plastic handles locked in place. Stoft advises shoppers to place the  heavier bags on the tote handle first, so they can easily balance a large  number of bags at the same time. The underneath portion of the handle has  finger grooves to give shoppers a comfortable grip.    Grocery Tote weighs a few ounces, so it's lightweight enough to carry in a  purse or back pocket. It retails for about $2 and is available at Ralphs  markets or by mail order from Castech Enterprises, 13145 Bromont Ave., Suite 7,  Sylmar 91342; phone, (818) 367-4474.    Lean on This    Back pain bothering you? You might want to try a German-built inflatable lumbar  support cushion that was designed for cars but seems to work just as  effectively in airplane or train seats, or on office furniture.    Zender Aerodynamiks of North America, based in Anaheim, is offering the durable  cloth-covered cushion, originally constructed to fit current model Volkswagen  seats and other high-performance auto seats, for about $38.    The inflation bulb attached to the cushion works like the armband machines used  to test blood pressure: You turn the valve slightly and pump up the pillow to  the desired firmness; to deflate it, turn the valvee the other way.    Said a Zender representative, "I use one in my chair at the office for back  support."    The cushions are available at any of Zender's 2,200 nationwide auto accessory  dealers. If you don't have one of the company's dealers in your area, contact  Zender Aerodynamiks of North America, 2267 Via Burton St., Anaheim 92805; or  call (800) 672-6060 in California, (800) 421-5544 outside California.    Parenting Advice    On Sept. 7, the National Parenting Center, a new 24-hour, seven-day-a-week hot  line began offering parents expert child-rearing guidance in seven categories  -- pregnancy, newborn, infant, toddler, preschool, preteen and adolescent. The  service can be accessed only from touch-tone telephones.    Television director-producer David Katzner, who also runs an independent  production company in Los Angeles, began working on the concept for the center  shortly after his daughter Alana, 2 1/2, was born.    "Suddenly I found myself searching everywhere for information on how to be a  parent," Katzner explained. "The National Parenting Center was a natural  extension of my own search for child-rearing information."    Callers to the center will receive child care information from one-minute tapes  made by nine of the country's top physicians, obstetrician-gynecologists,  psychologists and authors on subjects ranging from teething to temper tantrums  to truancy.    After listening to the tape, the caller can cut through to a voice-activated  response system, which includes the option to leave a question for an expert  and receive a written opinion.    Cost for calling the center is $1.95 for the first minute; $.95 for every  minute thereafter. Parents also may buy memberships via phone for $19.95 a  year, which includes a touch-tone phone, a monthly newsletter with updates on  new topics, novelties, brochures, and discounts on books and videos. To reach  the center, call (900) 246-MOMS. LYNN SIMROSS

headline:   FILIPINOS KILL 2 AMERICANS AS QUAYLE ARRIVES   
text:   Two American civilians working for a U.S. Air Force communications facility  north of Manila were ambushed and killed by gunmen Tuesday, hours before Vice  President Dan Quayle arrived amid anti-American demonstrations in this  increasingly tense capital city.    Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, U.S. and Philippine  officials said the ambush appeared to be the work of the Communist New People's  Army, which has killed four Americans here in the last two years.    U.S. officials confirmed that they had received threats from the NPA that  Americans would be attacked if Quayle came to Manila.      Demonstrators Chant    About 200 demonstrators chanted "Yankee Go Home" and burned a large American  flag as Quayle's motorcade sped away from Ninoy Aquino International Airport,  where he arrived at 7:30 p.m. The protesters demanded an end to U.S. military  bases in the Philippines.    Security officials were bracing for large demonstrations and possible violence  today as Quayle begins the formal part of his 40-hour visit to the Philippines  with a call on President Corazon Aquino at Malacanang Palace.    Quayle is expected to give Aquino a letter from President Bush formally asking  for the opening of negotiations on the future of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay  Naval Base, America's largest overseas military installations, as well as four  smaller facilities. U.S. officials said the letter proposes no specific terms.    The bases issue is increasingly divisive here. The Pentagon considers them  vital to protecting Pacific sea lanes, but many Philippine leaders regard them  as a reminder of the nation's colonial ties and an affront to national  sovereignty.    The current bases agreement expires in September, 1991. Any new agreement must  be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the bases  is strong. Other officials have called for phasing out the bases in five to 10  years.      Dead Americans Identified    The two Americans killed Tuesday were identified as William H. Thompson, 45,  and Donald G. Buchner, 44. Officials said both had retired from the Air Force  and were technicians for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp., a Pentagon  contractor at Camp O'Donnell, about 60 miles north of Manila.    Officials said Camp O'Donnell is an Air Force communications facility with 135  employees. They help operate an electronic warfare and bombing range at Clark's  sprawling Crowe Valley training facility.    In Washington, a State Department spokesman called the killings "senseless and  cowardly."    Susan M. Pearce, a vice president at the headquarters of Ford Aerospace Corp.  in Newport Beach, said the company has "maintained good relations with the  local Philippine community" and "there is no apparent motive for this attack."    The two victims, both married with children, were among 85 Ford Aerospace  workers at Camp O'Donnell, Pearce said. She added that there has never been "a  prior incident of this kind involving our personnel."    Air Force Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark, said early today that  military personnel and Defense Department employees in the Philippines "are  being advised to avoid non-essential travel between facilities until further  notice." The U.S. military television network later announced that Camp  O'Donnell personnel should not report for work today.    Nearly 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian employees are  stationed at the two bases, which employ 68,000 Filipinos.    A police spokesman said the two Americans were ambushed at 4:40 p.m. Tuesday  about 12 miles north of Clark Air Base on a rural highway that connects Camp  O'Donnell with the town of Capas in Tarlac province.    The Capas police chief, Lt. Pepito Pimentel, said Thompson was driving a Toyota  Corolla, with Buchner beside him, when a large truck suddenly blocked the road.  Pimentel said six men armed with M-16 and M-14 rifles opened fire on the  Americans, riddling them with bullets.      69 Spent Cartridges Found    "We found 69 spent cartridges at the ambush site," Pimentel said.    The bodies were taken to Clark by ambulance.    "I think there's no doubt it's the NPA," a military officer said early today.  He speculated that the killers were part of the Central Luzon Regional  Commission, an New People's Army guerrilla group that killed two U.S. Air Force  enlisted men and an American civilian outside Clark on Oct. 28, 1987.    Five months ago, on April 21, U.S. Army Col. James (Nick) Rowe, a  counterinsurgency expert, was ambushed and killed in the Manila suburb of  Quezon City as he was being driven to his office at the U.S. Joint Military  Assistance Group.    The NPA said later that it had killed Rowe, 51, a decorated Vietnam veteran and  former prisoner of war, because of his involvement in the Philippine  government's "total war" against the rebels.    Two weeks earlier, guerrillas blew up a communications facility operated by the  U.S. Air Force and Navy and the Philippine military near Baguio in northern  Luzon. No one was injured.    Tuesday's ambush came after a week of arrests and demonstrations outside the  U.S. Embassy, a series of shootings and grenade attacks in Manila and a barrage  of anti-American press reports over alleged meddling in Philippine affairs.    Early Tuesday, unidentified gunmen shot and killed a staff officer of President  Aquino's security command about a mile from the presidential palace. He was the  fourth member of the presidential guard killed in the last four months.  Military officials have blamed urban Communist guerrillas -- known as  "sparrows" for their swiftness -- for the attacks.    Later Tuesday, 10 students were arrested after demonstrators protesting  Quayle's visit and rising tuition fees tossed a small homemade bomb at riot  police on a street across the Pasig River from the presidential palace. Six  police officers were injured.    Manila police and military units have been on the alert for the past two weeks,  since three grenade explosions killed two people and wounded 16 others.  Although the attacks remain unsolved, the blasts fueled new coup rumors and  increased tension.    As Quayle arrived in Manila, leftist student groups chanted "Bases out!" and  "Quayle go home!" from behind lines of helmeted riot police at the airport  entrance. Three youths wearing red bandannas over their faces set fire to a  tattered U.S. flag hung on a pole. Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, were probably  unable to see the blaze as their car sped by.    "We are against the visit of Vice President Quayle because it is symbolic of  further intervention by the U.S. in the Philippines," said Noel Medina, 25, an  organizer of a protest group called Youth for Democracy and Nationalism. "We  are against the presence of U.S. bases in our country."    Quayle will visit the Clark and Subic bases this afternoon after meeting  congressional leaders and placing a wreath at the U.S. World War II cemetery in  Manila.    He arrived from Tokyo on a 12-day, four-nation Pacific tour that began in South  Korea and will end Friday in Malaysia.

headline:   CULTURAL MEDIATORS;    THE SEARCH FOR MINORITY TEACHERS   
text:   When Albert Thibodeaux is graduated from Xavier University in New Orleans two  years from now, recruiters from all over the country will be lining up scores  deep to offer him a job. Before making his final decision, he will attend  employment conferences where there will often be more recruiters than students.    The prospects are similar for Lisa Carrasco Laue at Cal State Los Angeles, for  Sharon Mosely at Norfolk State University and for hundreds of other minority  students like them. But, paradoxically, few of their fellow students want to be  in their shoes.    Why? They are studying to be school teachers.    Among education students, Laue, Thibodeaux and Mosely are a rare breed. Fewer  and fewer minorities are choosing to enter the teaching profession. The  consequence is that as the student populations in the nation's schools become  increasingly black, Latino and Asian, the teaching and administrative staffs  are becoming increasingly white.      Critical Need    Members of the nation's education community warn that there is a critical need  for minority teachers. Such teachers, they say, serve not only as role models  for both minority and non-minority children, but also as cultural mediators  between minority students and white teachers and students.    "No population group has solved all of the problems that students in training  come across," said Harvard University professor Charles Willie, who has studied  the impact of largely white teaching staffs on minority students in college.  "This means a diversified teaching staff gives the learning environment a  better chance of dealing with the full range of human issues.    "Often, very fine teachers with the best intentions violate some cardinal  cultural rules in trying to instruct students which they would not violate if  they had peers who they could turn to for advice," Willie said.      A False Signal    Dr. Elaine P. Witty, dean of the school of education at Norfolk State  University in Virginia, said the absence of minority instructors can send a  false signal. "Children look at the composition of the faculty and conclude  that those people who are white are the people we can look up to for the  dissemination of information, for being in charge of things, for showing  authority, making decisions and exerting leadership. That's a dangerous and  damaging message."    It also means, she said, that "you lose the resource of minority teachers to  serve as mediators of their culture for other students. For white students, we  are teaching them a false view of the world. In a world that is not  predominantly white, they grow up experiencing and seeing a white-controlled  school system. And, since we live in a global society and most of those are  people of color, they need to learn there are values and intelligence in a  variety of cultures and people."    There are a growing number of efforts to reverse the trend and some signs that  students may be renewing an interest in teaching. And there will be a sharpened  national focus on public education this week, with President Bush meeting with  all 50 governors today and Thursday at the University of Virginia for a summit  conference on the subject. But against this hopeful backdrop, school systems  that are trying to make their faculties more reflective of society at large are  finding it increasingly difficult to hire minority teachers.    "It's a problem nationwide," said Ben Lujan, director of certificate  recruitment and selection for the Los Angeles Unified School District, whose  teaching staff is nearly 70% white and whose student body is 80% minority.    "Our underlying theme when we go recruiting is that we are vying for minority  teachers. But we find that universities do not have the minority numbers in  their programs to serve the needs of the nation's school system."    Across the nation, as minority teachers who are now at work reach retirement  age, the concern becomes more pressing. Currently, minorities make up just over  9% of all teachers, down from 17% in the mid-1970s. By the turn of the century,  the National Education Assn. predicts, only one public school teacher in 20  will be a minority, while nearly one of every three schoolchildren will be  black, brown or Asian.      Brief Surplus    A brief oversupply of teachers in the 1970s led to a substantial decline in the  number of students of all races who went into education schools. But, minority  enrollment plunged even faster and has remained depressed because of a number  of other factors, educators said.    For one thing, they said, the minority teacher shortage is actually a tribute  to affirmative action and the increased job opportunities for minorities over  the past 20 years.    "When I was coming out of school, teaching was about all you could do," said  Lois Pointer, a teacher for nearly 33 years in Memphis where nearly half of the  instructors are black. "You could be a teacher, a preacher, maybe a nurse or  work in the post office. Now students have a wide range of opportunities."    As students have considered careers that were closed to their parents, they  have turned away from teaching because of its decreased status and  comparatively low pay. The average teacher salary in the United States in  1988-89 was $29,629, according to the American Federation of Teachers.    "When I tell people I'm a teacher, they say: 'You couldn't pay me enough money  to teach,' " said Adriann Wilson, 29, of Memphis.    In many cases, minority students are steered away from the profession. Wilson  recalls that nearly every teacher she had at Melrose High School urged her to  go into another field.    "They said engineering, medicine, business -- anything but teaching," she said.  "They told me there was no money and too many hassles and too much hard work  and you don't get paid for the amount of time you put into your schooling  overall."    Children of teachers are especially likely to hear such words of  discouragement.    "I would prefer my children to try something else," said Doris Buchanan, a  Memphis teacher. "You don't get rewarded for what you do." Both of her children  are now in college, neither pursuing education as a career.    "I encouraged my son and my daughter not to become school teachers," added Lois  Gilder, a Memphis teacher whose daughter expects to finish college in the  spring with a degree in marketing. "Years ago, teachers had the utmost respect  from the community and the families. Now the teachers seem to be way down the  ladder on the respect list.    "The thing that really bothers me is that everybody seems to be making  extremely more money than we are, and yet if it weren't for good school  teachers, they wouldn't be where they are."    She cites the case of her younger brother, who was graduated from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985 and started immediately at Hughes  Aircraft, making $29,500 annually. After a year, the company sent him to the  University of Southern California to get his master's degree while continuing  his pay and cutting his hours in half to allow for school.    "He's now making $32,000 and he's only 28 years old," she said. "My income is  $34,000 and I have been working 27 years and I have a master's degree plus 45  hours."    The advent of teacher testing in the early and mid-1980s contributed to the  drop in minority students in education programs, educators said, because  minority teachers initially failed the tests at a much greater rate than  whites. For example, in Louisiana in 1981 only 21% of black teachers passed  examinations compared to 78% of whites.      Issue Disappears    Testing has disappeared as an issue, but it exerted a "chilling effect on  minority teacher enrollment," said Antoine Garibaldi, dean of arts and sciences  at Xavier. "Lots of students turn away from teaching because the feeling was  that even after you got through everything else, you might not be able to get  by the test, so why bother."    Another major reason for the decline is particularly disturbing to many  educators: while a larger percentage of blacks and Latinos are finishing high  school, a smaller percentage are attending college. According to the American  Council on Education, 20% fewer black high school graduates enrolled in college  in 1985 than in 1976. During the same period, 25% fewer Latino high school  graduates enrolled.    Educators say that the reason has to do with money. As grants and aid for  college education declined, minority students, most of them first-generation  college prospects, simply couldn't afford school. That trend is particularly  disturbing for education schools because teachers are usually first-generation  college students, educators said.    "Normally persons who have gone into teacher education have been persons who  come from the lower middle class and it's the first time for the family into a  profession," said Dr. Eugene Eubanks, professor for education and urban affairs  at the University of Minnesota.    At the School of Education at Norfolk State University, Witty says, "The  largest percent of my enrollment of black students are first generation  college-goers and I have a larger percentage of first generation college-goers  than any other school at the university. If we could get more students in the  school, we'd get our share of teachers."    Mosely and Thibodeaux are first-generation college students, as, they said, are  many of their fellow students.    As the number of minority college students going to other professions has  increased and the percentage of minority students attending college has  declined, minority enrollment in education schools has spiralled downward  dramatically.    Predominantly black colleges, which have produced over half of the nation's  black teachers, saw their education school enrollments drop from 25% of the  student body in 1977 to less than 10% today. In Louisiana, the number of black  students who were graduated from teacher education programs fell by two-thirds  from 1976 to 1983. Norfolk State, which averaged 250 black education graduates  annually in the 1970s, produced only 78 last year.    Consequently, the nation's school systems find themselves scrambling for their  share of minority teachers.    "It's real competitive," said Dr. Michael Acosta, head of administrative  personnel for the Los Angeles school system. "Our recruiters have gone all over  the country. We've gone all over the South, gone to the career fairs, gone to  large urban cities where there are large populations of blacks and Latinos. We  advertise in journals. We use Spanish-language publications. Our recruiters end  up meeting at the same places all the time."    It's so bad, said Linda Sumners, director of hiring for the Fulton County Board  of Education just outside of Atlanta, that during a recent recruitment  conference at Florida A&amp;M in Tallahassee there were 120 recruiters and only  50 students.    "It's like a student walks through the door and you jump on them," she said.      Hopeful Signs    Nevertheless, a few hopeful signs have begun to appear.    Across the country, educators are beginning to design programs that encourage  youngsters to become teachers. The Los Angeles school system, for instance, in  1985 began the Teachers Training Academy, a magnet program at Crenshaw High  School for students interested in pursuing the teaching profession. It has  become a model for other school systems, such as Washington, D.C., and San  Diego.    "I think it has been a mistake on all of our parts not to promote teaching as a  career," said Jewell Boutte, principal of Crenshaw. "Educators have a  responsibility for encouraging children to go into education."    The American Council on Education reports that the percentage of minority high  school students enrolled in college is beginning to creep back up. Teachers'  salaries are up significantly in some areas -- Los Angeles teachers won a 24%  increase in their new three-year contract and Rochester, N.Y., teachers can  earn up to $70,000 -- and many schools are pushing teaching as an interim,  rather than a lifelong, profession.    "Teaching is not going to be a lifetime career that it has been for the  majority of individuals who are in the profession today," Garibaldi of Xavier  said. "The idea is that many students will teach for awhile and then go on to  other professions."    Meanwhile, some colleges report a changing attitude among students that could  mean more will enter teaching.    "Teaching has been hard to sell, particularly at a time of the 'me'  generation," Witty said. "We're finding that those who are going into teaching  have almost a Peace Corps mentality. They are going forth to serve."    Thibodeaux, 20, a social studies education major, and Mosely, 27, a former  justice administration major, reflect that new attitude. "I felt that there was  a need particularly for black male teachers," said Thibodeaux, who wants to  teach in his hometown of New Orleans. "I went to an all-male Catholic high  school. My most influential teachers were black men. I found this throughout my  educational career, that my most influential teachers were black teachers."    Mosely said she had heard the arguments that her salary would lag behind those  in other professions, but after two years of substitute teaching in the  Virginia Beach school system she found her enjoyment of teaching was more  important than the money she would earn.    "I'm the kind of person who makes decisions for herself," she said of those  urging her to pursue another profession. "What really makes up the difference  for me is seeing the children progress. That's like getting paid all over  again."      COLLEGE GRADUATES RECEIVING TEACHING CERTIFICATES    The number of college graduates receiving teaching certificates has declined,  as has the percentage of such graduates within each major ethnic group.   <TABLE CWL="1.78IN:1.89IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL

headline:   FILIPINOS KILL 2 AMERICANS AS QUAYLE ARRIVES   
text:   Vice President Dan Quayle, who arrived amid anti-American demonstrations here  Tuesday night shortly after suspected Communist rebels killed two American  employees at a U.S. military base, today condemned the killings as "cowardly  murders" that were linked to his visit.    Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, U.S. and Philippine  officials said the bloody ambush appeared to be the work of the Communist New  People's Army, which has assassinated four other Americans in the last two  years.    U.S. officials confirmed that they had received threats from the NPA that  Americans would be attacked if Quayle arrived here.      'People Are Sickened'    "It should go without saying that these cowardly murders deserve the strong  condemnation of all civilized men and women," Quayle told a breakfast meeting  with business groups. "The people of the Philippines, like the people of the  United States, are sickened by the acts of vicious terrorists who wish to drown  freedom in the blood of innocent men and women.    "The killings unfortunately were timed to my visit," he told reporters.    The two slain Americans were identified as William H. Thompson, 45, and Donald  G. Buchner, 44. Officials said both men had retired from the Air Force in 1987  and were technicians for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp., a Pentagon  contractor at Camp O'Donnell, about 60 miles north of Manila.    Susan M. Pearce, a vice president at the headquarters of Ford Aerospace Corp.  in Newport Beach, Calif., said the company has "maintained good relations with  the local Philippine community" and "there is no apparent motive for this  attack."    The two victims, both married with children, were among 85 Ford Aerospace  workers at Camp O'Donnell, Pearce said. She added that there has never been "a  prior incident of this kind involving our personnel."      Communications Facility    Officials said Camp O'Donnell is a sophisticated military communications  facility with a U.S. Navy radio transmitter, an embassy radio relay station,  and an Air Force electronic warfare system for Clark's sprawling Crowe Valley  bombing range. O'Donnell has about 135 military and civilian employees.    Quayle also met briefly with the widow of an officer of President Corazon  Aquino's palace guard, who was killed in a separate ambush earlier Tuesday  about a mile from the presidential palace. Quayle blamed the New People's Army  for his death as well.    About 200 demonstrators chanted "Yankee Go Home" and burned a large American  flag as Quayle's motorcade sped past the entrance to Ninoy Aquino International  Airport when Quayle arrived Tuesday evening. The protesters demanded an end to  U.S. military bases in the Philippines.    Security officials blocked streets and kept demonstrators far from the vice  president this morning as Quayle began the formal portion of his 40-hour visit  to the Philippines with a wreath-laying ceremony and a 40-minute meeting with  President Corazon Aquino at Malacanang Palace.    Quayle presented Aquino with a letter from President Bush formally asking to  open negotiations over the future of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base,  America's largest overseas military garrisons, and four smaller facilities. The  one-page letter asked that talks begin by December but offered no specific  terms, U.S. officials said.    The bases issue is increasingly divisive here. The Pentagon considers the  installations vital to protecting Pacific sea lanes and preserving stability in  the region. But many Philippine leaders regard them as a vestige of the  nation's colonial ties to the U.S. and an affront to national sovereignty.    The current contract for the bases expires in September, 1991. Any new  agreement must be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition  to the bases is strong. Other officials have called for phasing the bases out  in five to ten years.    In Washington, meanwhile, a State Department spokesman denounced the killings  of the two Americans as "senseless and cowardly."    Air Force Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark Air Base, said early today  that military personnel and Department of Defense employees in the Philippines  "are being advised to avoid non-essential travel between facilities until  further notice." The U.S. military television network later announced that Camp  O'Donnell personnel should not report for work today.    Nearly 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian employees are  stationed at the bases. They also employ 68,000 Filipinos.    Police said the two Americans were ambushed Tuesday afternoon about 12 miles  north of Clark on a paved rural highway that connects Camp O'Donnell with the  town of Capas in Tarlac province.    Capas Police Chief Pepito Pimentel said Thompson was driving a Toyota Corolla  south, with Buckner beside him, when a dump truck suddenly blocked the road.  Pimentel said six men armed with M-16 and M-14 assault rifles leaped out and  opened fire on the Americans, riddling them and the car with bullets. The two  men were found slumped in their seats, with both doors open. "The bodies were  heavily mangled," Pimentel said. "We found 69 spent cartridges at the ambush  site."    Capas Mayor Hermes Frias said nothing was taken from the bodies, and the car  was not ransacked. "This was a well planned ambush," he said. "They knew what  time the car was passing by."    The assailants fled in a jeepney. An M-16 magazine and live 9-millimeter  bullets were found in the dump truck.    "I think there's no doubt it's the NPA," one Western military official said  early today. He speculated that the killers were part of the Central Luzon  Regional Front, an New People's Army guerrilla group that killed two U.S. Air  Force enlisted men and an American civilian outside Clark on Oct. 28, 1987.    Five months ago, on April 21, U.S. Army Col. James Rowe, a counterinsurgency  expert, was ambushed and killed in the Manila suburb of Quezon City as he was  being driven to his office at the U.S. Joint Military Assistance Group.    The New People's Army later said it killed Rowe, 51, a heavily decorated  Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, for his "direct" involvement in the  Philippine government's "total war" policy against the rebels.    Two weeks earlier, guerrillas blew up a communications facility operated by the  U.S. Air Force and Navy and the Philippine military near Baguio in northern  Luzon. No one was injured.    Tuesday's ambush came after a week of arrests and demonstrations outside the  U.S. Embassy, a series of shootings and grenade attacks in Manila, and a  barrage of anti-American press reports over alleged "meddling" in Philippine  affairs.    Early Tuesday, unidentified gunmen shot and killed Capt. Carlos Daileg, a staff  officer of President Aquino's security command as he drove his car about a mile  from the presidential palace. He was the fourth member of the presidential  guard killed in the past four months.    Later Tuesday, 10 students were arrested after demonstrators protesting  Quayle's visit and rising tuition fees tossed a small homemade bomb at riot  police on a street across the Pasig River from the presidential palace. Six  police were injured.

headline:   THE WELL-OFF AND HEALTHY GET A CYNICAL FREE RIDE;    HEALTH CARE: GOVERNMENT, RENEGING ON ITS RESPONSIBILITY, IS FORCING HOSPITALS  TO LEAN ON PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS TO PAY FOR THE INDIGENT.   
text:   The Supreme Court decision holding that hospitals have a right to "reasonable  and adequate" payment under Medicaid (in California, Medi-Cal) could benefit  academic medical centers, and it is likely to be a significant victory for the  poor.    Academic medical centers nationally treat disproportionately high numbers of  indigent patients. In 1987, their teaching hospitals accounted for 34% of  Medicaid-reimbursed discharges, with 14% of their gross revenues derived from  the government program. The hospitals also accounted for $2.1 billion, or 59%,  of all "charity care" -- that is, care of individuals unable to pay and lacking  Medicaid coverage.    As the federal government requires more services for low-income people under  the Medicaid program, the states sharing the costs of the program underfund it,  and the academic centers get the brunt of the financial hits. Unless they make  their case for better rates, some of them will have a difficult time surviving.  With the law on their side, they may succeed, because the alternative -- to be  forced by financial necessity to turn their backs on the poor -- is both  unpalatable and wrong.    Academic medical centers have a long tradition in caring for the poor; indeed,  improving the human condition is the goal that spawned them in the first place.  Without this commitment, they would be simply another indistinguishable part of  our profit-oriented society, and the young doctors and others they turn out --  and society-at-large -- would be the poorer for it. But government actions make  their future less assured.    The situation in California, and at my institution in particular, is a case in  point. In 1983 the state adopted competitive bidding as a mechanism for  controlling Medi-Cal costs. It appointed a commission to bargain with competing  hospitals, and Stanford University Hospital was among those awarded contracts.  But the state has since failed to accept the participating hospitals' costs,  even though they result from the bidding process and are based on acceptable  medical practice and prevailing market conditions. Over time, the state has  attempted to force those bids to fit some predetermined state budget target.    At Stanford Hospital the number of Medi-Cal patients has been increasing 12%  annually since 1988, out of proportion to the number of fully paying patients.  Medi-Cal patients now represent 19% of all patient days, and in some services  even more. In our obstetrics and gynecology service, for example, 32.4% of this  year's patients have been under Medi-Cal. The county hospital in San Mateo has  no obstetrical service or newborn nursery, and private obstetricians are so  poorly reimbursed by the state that most decline to take Medi-Cal patients.    These women do not receive adequate -- if any -- prenatal care, and they often  arrive in our hospital in active labor. A disproportionate number of their  babies are underdeveloped, HIV-positive or drug-addicted, and require  around-the-clock neonatal intensive care.    More than one-quarter of the indigent patients admitted to Stanford come from  outside Santa Clara County and neighboring San Mateo County. They are very sick  and require longer stays, causing a disproportionate drain on hospital funds.    Our hospital this year will spend $51.7 million on Medi-Cal patients, but will  receive only $22.1 million in reimbursement from the state. Loss of income from  the state's failure to cover other costs is estimated at $5.9 million (though a  current negotiation with the state may provide some relief). In addition, our  faculty medical practice, which collects less than 29 cents on the dollar  billed to Medi-Cal, had bad debts of $9.3 million in 1989.    Thus we are stuck with $44.8 million of uncompensated care. As a private,  nonprofit institution, our hospital can turn to no other source to make up a  loss of this magnitude. The hospital gets no tax support or state subsidies for  its teaching programs; it depends on patient revenues. When the government pays  a fraction of the cost, the difference must be passed on to privately insured  patients -- and we don't think they should be penalized that way.    Like all hospitals, ours also faces severe competitive pressures. Local  businesses and consumers look to us for leadership in reducing health-care  costs. We have responded with a program to improve efficiency, and we have cut  $30 million from the hospital's $320 million operating budget this year -- and  there are more cuts to come. But if we continue to carry the burden of  uncompensated care, we may not succeed in this effort.    Unlike community hospitals, which offer care to a relatively homogenous and  affluent population, academic centers must fulfill multiple functions. They  train students, resident physicians and others, and serve as sites for research  to advance new diagnoses and lifesaving therapies. They must offer training  across the full range of clinical activity.    Academic medical centers have depended on revenues from paying patients to  support their work. Without a large base of private patients, financial  difficulties could force them to close. Neither their insistence on maintaining  a sound financial base nor their expectation of fair treatment from Medicaid is  self-serving. Their ability to serve the public depends on both. Our academic  centers are a national resource that deserves protective government policies to  ensure adequate -- just adequate -- reimbursement.    In effect, government is saying that it's better for the costs of people who  are poor and ill to be borne by those who are wealthy and ill, rather than by  those who are well-off and healthy. No one in his right mind would dream up  such a cynical policy, but that's precisely the policy now operative in  Medicaid.

text:   I read with dismay (June 12) that City Council members Richard Alatorre and  Gloria Molina oppose the restoration of the Italian Hall as part of the  revitalization of El Pueblo Historic Park.    This significant building is one of the park's 27 important landmarks.    Representing a variety of architectural styles and types, these historic  structures are among the most eloquent testaments to our city's diverse  cultural heritage. Together, they form an ensemble of memories commemorating an  era that began when the plaza was at the center of a small pueblo located on  the edge of the Spanish empire and continued into the 20th Century when the  plaza became a focus of industrial activity and a home for various ethnic  communities.    But rather than celebrating this valuable legacy, Alatorre and Molina seek to  obliterate it. Their opposition to restoring the Italian Hall is an attempt to  rewrite history and isolate the park from its multicultural past.    Hopefully, the City Council will reject their narrow, exclusionary approach. By  accepting the Recreation and Park Commission's authorization to restore the  Italian Hall, the Council will go a long way in adopting a revitalization plan  that will be faithful to the park's long and complex history.

So  basically for 30 cents, you're going to get a lot of good service.

headline:   COLUMN RIGHT;    'HARMONIZING' WILL HANDCUFF FREE MARKETS;    THE BUREAUCRATIC PREROGATIVE HAS SHIFTED TO ECONOMIC INTERVENTION, THE NEW  SOCIALISM.   
text:   My colleague, Edward Luttwak, says that the waning of the Cold War means the  decline of geopolitics and the rise of geo-economics. The vast bureaucracies  that comprise the modern state and the intellectual resources organized in  universities and think tanks will find themselves "impelled by the bureaucratic  urges of role-preservation and role-enhancement to acquire a geo-economic  substitute for their decaying geopolitical role."    If he is right, it means that the West will experience a new onslaught of  economic intervention by the state. It is ironic that the collapse of socialism  has set in motion two opposite forces. On the one hand, socialist economic  failure has spurred privatization and renewed commitment to a market economy.  On the other, the decline of the communist geopolitical threat means that  Western bureaucracies and strategic thinkers will have to find a new  self-justification. Luttwak thinks that the bureaucratic imperative will shift  conflict to the arena of commerce.    The new socialism will hide behind a patriotic nationalism as foreigner-bashing  moves to the fore. Instead of defusing commercial conflicts in the interests of  geopolitical alliances, politicians and bureaucrats will be quick to politicize  them. The causes and instruments of conflict will become economic. Disguised  import restrictions, concealed subsidies, public funding of commercial  technologies and the manipulation of fiscal and regulatory measures to  disadvantage foreign competitors are among geo-economic weapons.    Much of this has been going on for years, but the decline of the Soviet threat  will unleash geo-economic rivalries within the Western alliance that were  formerly subdued by a common purpose. Industrial policy could come into its own  as bureaucracies, politicians and commercial interests engage in symbiotic  manipulation. As the state manages its geo-economic interests, profitability  will be less determined by market forces. If we are indeed entering an era of  geo-economics, economies will be increasingly characterized by rent-seeking  activities in which people use government to create protected profits that are  not subject to competition. Consumers everywhere will be the loser as  governments manipulate economies in the name of survival in a competitive  world.    The conventional wisdom today is that the Japanese have a head start in  geo-economic strategy and that we must rush to catch up. On the whole, the  policies that are adopted will work to stifle competition and increase the role  of privilege in our economic system. The world economies will suffer, just as  the punitive measures we imposed on foreign purchasers of U.S. real estate have  worsened the savings and loan problem.    Already we can see within the European Community a shift away from reliance on  market forces to harmonize national economic differences. Under the leadership  of the French socialist Jacques Delors, the new emphasis is on social  harmonization achieved through regulatory means. Social regulations designed to  equalize labor costs across national boundaries are a subtle form of  protectionism for the trade unions in the welfare democracies and French and  German business cartels.    Luttwak is right that a diminishing Soviet threat will give wider scope to  rent-seekers. But the battle between privilege and competition is as old as  economics itself, and each generation has to fight it. The other side of  communism's decline -- the failure of state interventionism -- together with  the dismal failure of development planning in the Third World, greatly  strengthens the case for free markets. All over the world people have lost  confidence in government and no longer associate more government with the  public interest.    Geo-economic rivalries could even work to free international businesses from  government controls. Just as international capital markets have made it harder  more difficult for national central banks to control domestic interest rates,  multinational companies are unlikely to come under the sway of national  governments. The free market itself is a powerful force, as the rise of  extensive informal economies in Latin America and the Soviet Union demonstrate.  As a result of 20th-Century experience, no honest intellectual can make a case  for more state interventionism.    As Mikhail Gorbachev recently said, the market economy "has existed for  centuries. It is an invention of civilization."

headline:   PADRES LOSE A WILD ONE;    BASEBALL: THOMAS' 12TH-INNING HOME RUN GIVES BRAVES 11-10 VICTORY, LEAVES  PADRES SHAKING THEIR HEADS.   
text:   Someone should have called in Rod Serling. He could have come out of nowhere  Sunday afternoon, materialized onto the baseball diamond at Atlanta-Fulton  County Stadium, looked at the crowd of 16,298 and provided relief.    "The scene you are witnessing is not a baseball game," he might have said.  "But, of course, you probably already have figured that out. Nothing like this  happens in real baseball games. Even you, watching the most dreadful team in  all of the National League, realize that.    "Come on, how can real major league players forget how many outs there are in  an inning? How can three-run leads vanish as if they're playing tee-ball? How  can a Padre pitcher, who never pinch-hit before in his career, hit a three-run  double, and be replaced by another pitcher as a pinch-runner? How a guy boot  two balls, go hitless in his first five at-bats, then become the hero?    "You see, there's only one explanation.    "You have entered the Twilight Zone."    The fans would have cheered. The Padres and Atlanta Braves could have stood  there, breaking into laughter. And Padre Manager Jack McKeon and Brave Manager  Russ Nixon would have felt a whole lot better.    But as it was, everyone had to sit there and endure 4 hours and 15 minutes of  what amounted to a simulated baseball game, before the Braves finally  persevered, winning 11-10 in 12 innings on Andres Thomas' leadoff home run.    "I've seen some crazy games in my life," said Padre pitcher Ed Whitson, "but  this takes the cake."    Yes, when you get 17 hits, hit two home runs, steal seven bases, and have a  pitcher come off the bench to deliver a three-run double in the 10th inning,  and still lose, there's little wonder no one in the Padre clubhouse felt like  touching a bite of dinner.    The Padres used 23 players, including 20 in the first nine innings, leaving out  only starter Andy Benes and reliever Eric Show.    The Braves used 20 pitchers, including their entire bullpen.    Bruce Hurst, the Padres' starting pitcher, lasted just 1 1/3 innings, the  shortest outing of his Padre career. Hurst (4-6), who yielded four hits and  five earned runs, has won just one game since May 18.    Pete Smith, the Braves' starting pitcher, hardly was better, yielding seven  hits and lasting four innings.    The Braves were within one strike of winning the game in the ninth inning. But  Jack Clark drew a walk and Padre third baseman Mike Pagliarulo followed with a  run-scoring double.    The Padres were within two outs of winning in the 10th, owning a three-run lead  with their best reliever on the mound, and still managed to blow the lead when  Jeff Blauser hit a three-run homer.    So, it was only fitting, right, that the hero of this game is the same man the  Braves crowd spent booing the entire afternoon -- shortstop Andres Thomas.    After publicly requesting a trade earlier in the week, Thomas was booed the  moment he stepped on the field. So you can just imagine what they thought of  him the previous 11 innings when he booted the first ball of the game, dropped  a throw by his catcher on a steal attempt, kicked another ball in the seventh,  and was hitless in his first five at-bats?    Funny, what a little home run can do to change someone's opinion.    The homer was hit off Craig Lefferts, the same man who gave up Blauser's  three-run homer in the 10th inning, erasing the heroics of Dennis Rasmussen,  who hit a pinch-hit, three-run double in the top of the 10th.    But, of course, Lefferts has pitched in four consecutive games -- 8 2/3  innings. Incredibly, he has pitched more innings the past two weeks than  starters Dennis Rasmussen and Hurst combined.    "I just didn't have anything today," Lefferts said. "Usually I pitch good when  I'm tired, but not today. It's time, I think, for a day off."    But instead of laying the blame of this defeat in the left arm of Lefferts, or  in the bats of Joe Carter or Garry Templeton, McKeon credited this baby to the  carelessness of Roberto Alomar.    It was Alomar who perhaps cost the Padres the game with his baserunning blunder  in the 12th. He was standing on second base with one out when Joe Carter hit a  fly ball to center field. Alomar took off running toward third, and upon seeing  that center fielder Ron Gant would catch the ball, he eased up and casually  rounded third.    He became startled when he heard the screaming by his father, third base coach  Sandy Alomar, and half of the bench. "There's only one out, Robbie, get back."  Oh-oh.    Alomar reversed course, ran on the inside part of third base bag, and headed  back to the second. Whew, everything would be OK, he thought. Sorry, Brave  third baseman Jim Presley saw everything, called for an appeal play because  Alomar never touched the third-base bag when returning to second.    Ed Rapuano, the third-base umpire, still called him safe. But he was overruled  by home-plate umpire Charlie Williams, who called him out.    McKeon bolted out of the dugout, arguing the call, while Sandy Alomar joined  in. McKeon confessed that he never knew if Roberto Alomar had touched the  third-base bag or not, but since he was out there, he might as well let out  some frustration.    Any frustration that remained inside McKeon, seeped out quite loudly after the  game inside his office while talking about Alomar's gaffe.    "He's got to get his head out . . .," McKeon said. "You've got to know how many  . . . outs there are. Maybe he needs to sit down for a few days to see what the  hell's going on.    "Hell, you should be able to count in this game, shouldn't you. I mean, it's  not that damn tough. He wants to be in the All-Star Game, maybe he should learn  to count.    "Maybe what we need is to get some cards made up, so Sandy can just flash them  up, showing one or two outs. Yeah, that's what I'll do, get some cards made  up."    Alomar, irritated by the perception that he was the goat, said: "I'm not going  to give any excuses, but it's the only mistake I made. Why should I feel  embarrassed? How can they blame the loss on me? I'm not thinking about the damn  All-Star Game, I just want to go out and play. It's bull . . . that they blame  this game on me.    "If he (McKeon) wants to put up cards for the outs, let him. I don't care. It's  fine with me."    Yet, it's not like this is the first time the Padres have lost track of the  outs or count in an inning. Four times in the past week the Padres have been  confused counting to three.     -- Alomar turned what he thought was a double play Wednesday against the  Giants, not realizing there were already two outs.     -- Padre outfielder Shawn Abner walked off the field with a two-count strike  on Joe Carter, thinking he had struck out.     -- Padre starter Andy Benes forgot the count while pitching June 15 against  the Dodgers.     -- And third baseman Mike Pagliarulo thought there were three outs May 9 in  St. Louis, allowing a run to score.    "I don't know what the hell to do," McKeon said. "Maybe next year we'll see if  we can have a change in the rules, and have four outs an inning.    "You assume people can count in this game.    "Apparently not."    Padre Notes    Eric Show on being one of only two Padres not to play Sunday: "I'm no longer  surprised when I don't pitch, I'm surprised when I do. If I got upset over  this, I'd be upset almost every day of this year.". . . Dennis Rasmussen raised  his batting average to .360 after his pinch-hit double. . . . The Padres have  hired two security guards for the players' wives for their current family trip,  paying them $900 apiece for their seven days of service.

headline:   CRIMINAL TYPE BAGS THE GOLD CUP;    HORSE RACING: THE 5-YEAR-OLD SON OF ALYDAR BEATS SUNDAY SILENCE BY A HEAD FOR  HIS THIRD CONSECUTIVE VICTORY.   
text:   Criminal Type has gone from being a horse who doesn't want the lead to a horse  who won't give it up. On Sunday, continuing his role as a transcontinental  giant- killer, Criminal Type held off Sunday Silence at the wire in one of the  most stirring Hollywood Gold Cups ever run.    The margin in the $1-million race was a head, and Wayne Lukas, who trains  Criminal Type, liked the outcome so much that he shot his right fist to the sky  as he walked across the track to greet his horse and his jockey, Jose Santos,  after they had pulled up.    Races with purses of $1-million or more ought to be routine for Lukas, who now  has won 15 of them, but Criminal Type's victory Sunday was special because it  came over last year's horse of the year and vaulted Criminal Type into the  early No. 1 position for this year's national honors.    "This is the year of Dick Tracy, so why not Criminal Type?" Lukas said. "This  victory took every bit we had, and maybe that includes the three or four  pounds, too."    Sunday Silence, who won the Californian at Hollywood Park on June 3, in his  first race in seven months after arthroscopic knee surgery, carried high weight  of 126 pounds under the handicap conditions, five pounds more than Criminal  Type.    The stretch-long duel between the two horses was reminiscent of Sunday  Silence's victory by a nose over Easy Goer in last year's Preakness. This time,  though, Sunday Silence and jockey Pat Valenzuela were on the receiving end of  the performance that got them to the wire on time in Baltimore.    "Maybe it was the five pounds that got us beat," Valenzeula said Sunday.  "That's a big difference between two horses when the race is a mile and a  quarter. My horse ran super, and the wire just came up too soon. My horse  finished well, but Criminal Type had a lot left."    Sunday Silence, who has lost five times in 14 starts, three of the defeats  coming at Hollywood Park, finished 3 1/2 lengths ahead of Opening Verse, and it  was another 2 3/4 lengths back to Santangelo, who at 49-1 was the biggest price  in the seven-horse field.    Ruhlmann, Sunday Silence's entrymate, ran fifth, and Mi Selecto and Stylish  Winner completed the order of finish.    Ruhlmann, who beat Criminal Type two out of three times at Santa Anita this  winter, including a 1 3/4-length victory over Lukas' 5-year-old in the Santa  Anita Handicap, lost by a neck to Criminal Type in another $1-million race, the  Pimlico Special, six weeks ago.    Santos, a 29-year-old Chilean-born jockey, has ridden Lukas horses for several  years, but still sometimes misinterprets the trainer's pre-race instructions.    "I didn't want to take any chances on him misunderstanding, so I just told him  to run the Pimlico race all over," Lukas said.    At Pimlico, the headstrong Ruhlmann went to the lead as he usually does, with  Criminal Type and Santos shadowing him, and that's the way the Gold Cup was  run.    Ruhlmann gave up the lead sooner on Sunday, though. After an opening quarter in  :23 1/5, a half-mile in :46 4/5 and three-quarters in 1:10 1/5, Ruhlmann found  Criminal Type and Sunday Silence both outside him and in full gear at the  quarter pole.    Criminal Type had the lead heading into the stretch, and Sunday Silence was on  the outside, right next to him. The two horses battled to the wire, with Santos  whipping furiously at Criminal Type's flanks.    "At the half-mile pole, I thought we were going to win," Santos said. "My horse  has got a big heart."    Asked if Sunday Silence might have passed Criminal Type in a couple more jumps,  Santos said: "If we had gone around (the track) another time, the result would  have been the same. My horse would have never given up."    As usual, Criminal Type sneaked up on the bettors, paying $6.80 to win as the  second choice behind the Sunday Silence-Ruhlmann entry. The son of Alydar and  Klepto, a No Robbery mare, has won nine of 22 races and he's been favored in  only one of the victories.    Only 30,010 attended Sunday, the second smallest crowd in the history of the  Gold Cup, which was first run in 1938.    "What makes this win more noteworthy is the fact that we did it after Criminal  Type's been on the road," Lukas said.    After winning the Pimlico Special, Criminal Type shipped from Baltimore to  Belmont Park, where he beat Housebuster and Easy Goer, Sunday Silence's  mainstay adversary from last year, in the Metropolitan Handicap on May 28.    "There was a difference in the weights, but the result still might have been  the same, knowing my horse," Lukas said Sunday. "He gets there (to the lead),  and then he stays there and fights."    It used to be that Criminal Type wouldn't pass horses. He's had eight second-  and third-place finishes, and three times he's been beaten by a nose or a head.    Chris McCarron rode Criminal Type during his sluggish days. McCarron, who  normally would have ridden Sunday Silence, is sidelined until the end of the  year with broken legs and a broken arm and was a spectator Sunday.    "Criminal Type was a sour horse and didn't do things right," McCarron said.  "Wayne got him convinced that racing was fun."    Criminal Type, timed in 1:59 4/5, earned $550,000, lifting his total over the  $2-million mark.    "It took two years for me to show him how to get his nose in front," Lukas  said. "He wasn't too social. He didn't like to run around other horses."    J.T. Lundy, president of Calumet Farm, followed Lukas across the track to greet  his horse and jockey. "He's a real game horse and he ran good," Lundy said. "I  got a little nervous when we were on the inside (of Sunday Silence)."    The race of the summer, the $1-million Arlington Challenge Cup, is supposed to  be between Sunday Silence and Easy Goer Aug. 4 at Arlington International. But  now they've both been beaten by Criminal Type.    "We're not supposed to be crashing that party, but maybe we'll crash it if  they'll let us," Lukas said. "Maybe they'll find room for us on the  also-eligible list. I'll buy J.T. a tie and we'll go."    The Arlington race would be the third straight $1-million stake for Criminal  Type. The horse is getting as accustomed as Lukas is to those kind of affairs.    Horse Racing Notes    Jose Santos, four-time national leader in purses, said after the Gold Cup that  there's a good chance he will leave New York after the Breeders' Cup in late  October and move to California. . . . The Gold Cup was the eighth win for  Santos in a race worth $1-million or more. . . . Chris McCarron and Laffit  Pincay have won 10 apiece, and Santos caught up with Pat Day, who was third on  that list. . . . Among trainers, Charlie Whittingham has eight $1-million wins,  seven less than Wayne Lukas.    Whittingham, who has won eight Gold Cups, has now finished second in the race  10 times. . . . Sunday Silence earned $200,000, leaving him about $31,000 short  of the $5-million mark. . . . Sunday Silence was upset by Prized at Hollywood  Park in last year's Swaps and he lost an allowance race, to the Lukas-trained  Houston, as a 2-year-old in 1988. . . . The Gold Cup was Sunday Silence's first  defeat since the Swaps and ended a three-race winning streak.    Criminal Type, whose first two racing years were spent in France, has won six  of his last 10 starts after his career started with nine losses in 12 races. .  . . Calumet Farm's other Gold Cup winners were Citation in 1951 and Two Lea in  1952.    Bold Forbes, who won the 1976 Kentucky Derby, apparently is sterile and will be  retired as a stallion, says Aaron Jones, one of the major shareholders in the  horse. Bold Forbes, who has been standing at Stone Farm in Paris, Ky., had a  poor record of getting mares in foal last year and this past breeding season he  was able to get only two mares pregnant. He is likely to be sent to the  Kentucky Horse Park, a Lexington, Ky., tourist attraction where several horses,  including John Henry and Forego, are spending their retirements.    Morry's Lad, a 4-year-old gelding who won the second race in 1:57 3/5, tying  the Hollywood Park record for 1 3/16 miles, was making his first start for  Claude Feillatre, who bought him from the Sully Stable for $1. The victory  Sunday was Morry's Lad's second in 13 starts.

headline:   DODGERS SEE RED IN LOSS;    BASEBALL: THEY LOSE AGAIN TO CINCINNATI, 10-6, AND LEARN THAT BELCHER HAS AN  INFLAMED PITCHING SHOULDER.   
text:   About the time Norm Charlton was rocking Riverfront Stadium in a  fourth-and-goal collision with catcher Mike Scioscia Sunday, it became  official.    The Dodger season has become one big pain.    In the first Sunday night home game in their history, the Reds beat the  Dodgers, 10-6, giving them two consecutive victories in the weekend series by a  total score of 21-12.    And that wasn't all. Before the game, pitcher Tim Belcher acknowledged what  teammates had suspected: He is suffering from an inflamed right shoulder.    Belcher, a projected top Dodger starting pitcher who has struggled with a 4.32  earned-run average, emphasized that he will not stop pitching.    But he has been treating the shoulder with ultrasound and stimulation therapy  and, if it doesn't improve, he will agree to take a cortisone shot.    "It's nothing that I can't pitch with, there's no real pain when I pitch, just  discomfort," said Belcher, who has been examined by Dr. Frank Jobe. "But it has  not felt right all year. Right now, overall, I feel like a train wreck."    Belcher gave up seven runs in four innings Saturday in an 11-6 loss, dropping  his record to 5-5. It was the fifth time in his last six starts that the  Dodgers have lost.    "I just have not felt right all year," Belcher said. "It's hard to put a finger  on it . . . but it's like I haven't been able to get loose. Not once have I  have felt like I've had my great stuff. If it doesn't get any better, a shot is  the next step."    Belcher said that he might have suffered from throwing too many pitches in his  first game of the season, a three-hit shutout in San Diego after only three  weeks of spring training.    "I would do the same thing again because I was trying to win a game . . . but I  believe that game was the problem," Belcher said. "I should not have done that  on just three weeks of spring training.    "You know, the owners can take that lockout and shove it. It was the worst  mistake the owners have ever made in their lives."    By winning two of three here, the National League West leaders have defeated  the Dodgers five times in seven games this season. The Dodgers blew a chance to  move within a half game of second place and instead remain in fourth, 10 1/2  games out of first.    But the Dodgers can take comfort in the knowledge that their next series is  against the National League's worst team. The team traveled late Sunday to  Atlanta, where they will begin a three-game series today with Ramon Martinez  attempting to duplicate his 18-strikeout feat against the Braves the last time  they met.    The Dodgers happily left Cincinnati, where they weren't merely beaten, they  were stunned. The Dodgers led six times during the weekend. The Reds came back  and regained the lead five times.    "It seemed like leads don't matter to them," said Chris Gwynn, who had his  second home run and three runs batted in while starting in place of Kal  Daniels. "It was like, we get a lead and -- boom -- they are right back at us.  Like they never even worried."    A sixth-inning homer by Gwynn scored Stan Javier, who had doubled, and gave the  Dodgers a 4-2 lead. It was one of Javier's three hits.    But with one out and a runner on first in the sixth, the Reds' Mariano Duncan  lofted a single to center against starter Fernando Valenzuela. Luis Quinones  blooped a run-scoring double to left and Joe Oliver blooped a run-scoring  single to center. Barry Larkin blooped a run-scoring single that landed in  shallow right field.    "Larkin couldn't have thrown that ball any better," Gwynn said.    Chris Sabo then made Valenzuela pay for giving up the bloop hits by hitting a  hanging curveball for a three-run home run. Valenzuela, 5-6 with a 4.09 ERA,  has won once in his last six starts.    But when the Reds finished with him, they still weren't finished. They had one  final point to make.    In the seventh inning, on a double by Oliver, reliever Charlton ran through a  signal to stop from third base coach Sam Perlozzo and headed toward Scioscia at  the plate. The relay from Alfredo Griffin arrived a split second late, and  Charlton bowled over Scioscia to score the final run.    "Just an aggressive play," Charlton said, smiling.    Teammate Todd Benzinger elaborated.    "Scioscia did a great job of blocking the plate in that deciding play on  Friday, and it cost us a game, so we decided it would not happen again,"  Benzinger said. "We were lucky we could get payback so soon."    Said Scioscia: "They didn't make any point with me. I've been hit before."    For the Dodgers, the hits just keep coming.    Dodger Notes    A highly placed source in the Detroit Tiger organization confirmed reports that  the Dodgers' Kirk Gibson has requested a trade. "He wants them to move him, and  they've offered him to us," said the source, who declined to be identified. In  interviews Sunday, neither Gibson nor Dodger Vice President Fred Claire would  deny the report about Gibson's request. "What I choose to say behind closed  doors is my business, and when I choose to share it, I will share it," an angry  Gibson said. "I don't have to respond to idiotic reports. I'm not going to be  forced to make a statement just because somebody writes an article. If somebody  alleges something about you, do you have to respond?"    Said Claire: "I am not going to address this situation. On any club you have  players who have feelings about situations, and they have to talk their way  through them. But I am not going to discuss this one." Claire acknowledged that  reports of Gibson's trade request could lower his value, because teams know the  Dodgers want to move him. "That could have an impact, yes," Claire said.    Gibson took batting practice with the active roster Sunday for the first time  since suffering a strained right groin a week ago. He is improving daily. . . .  Kal Daniels, suffering from back spasms, was examined by a local doctor  Saturday night and ordered to rest for a couple of days. He missed his second  consecutive start Sunday, his 13th missed start in 69 games this season.    Stan Javier extended his hitting streak to 13 games Sunday, during which he has  21 hits in 44 at-bats for a .477 average (.360 overall). Javier has hits in 14  of 17 starts, but acknowledged that he is helped by the fact that most National  League pitchers have not seen him. "It is harder to be a new pitcher in a  league, because you have to learn the hitters," Javier said. "For me, I figure,  they have to throw me strikes, no matter who it is. And I can hit strikes."  Javier is already one of the most disciplined hitters on the team, with 12  walks and only 13 strikeouts.

text:   Top-seeded Ivan Lendl, still looking for his first Wimbledon championship,  figures to have an easy time today with his first opponent, Argentina's  Christian Miniussi. But the ATP's official players guide shows a statistic that  makes Lendl a cinch to beat tennis' latest wonder child. The guide lists  Miniussi's birth date as July 5, 1987.    ATP officials said this was a typographical error and that Miniussi is 22, not  2.    Name game: The following is either a public service or a public nuisance,  depending on your opinion of Chris Berman, ESPN's nickname-happy commentator  and play-by-play man.    No longer restrained by network management, which muzzled his nicknaming a few  seasons ago but relented when his fans protested en masse, here is Berman's  1990 lineup:    Sil (When The Swallows Return To) Campusano, Philadelphia Phillies; Roberto  (Remember The) Alomar, San Diego Padres; Mark Carreon (My Wayward Son), New  York Mets; Eric (Little) Anthony, Houston Astros; Gary Sheffield (Of Dreams),  Milwaukee Brewers; Robin Ventura (Highway), Chicago White Sox; Todd (Good  Housekeeping) Zeile, St. Louis Cardinals; Jeff Ballard (Of A Thin Man),  Baltimore Orioles.    Trivia time: Who was the originator of Berman's "back-back-back-back-back"  call?    Spitting it out: Philadelphia Phillie outfielder Lenny Dykstra, when asked by  Richard Justice of the Washington Post whether the world is ready for him:  "Wake up, Dude, it's the 90s."    Where's Lou Holtz?: No. 1 in the architecture poll: Sally Jenkins of the  Washington Post recently noted Jennifer Capriati's "youthful frame of  reference."    In Paris for the French Open, Capriati was awed by the Cathedral of Notre Dame.  Said the 14-year-old: "I thought we were going to a football field."    His kind of town: Steve Jacobson of Newsday, on John Thompson's decision to  stay at Georgetown rather than become the Denver Nuggets' general manager: "He  would have been a strong black man working for the only black ownership in  sports. But then he has his penchant for control, which is his at Georgetown .  . .    "He'd have been as big as his players, but they wouldn't be his students. And  the job calls for some public relations skills. One of Thompson's favorite  tricks is to return calls to media people at dawn's early light after a night  game.    "It sounds as if he has worked out who is in charge with the new university  president."    Can't take the heat: In the old-timers game played Saturday at Arlington  Stadium, eight players were younger than Nolan Ryan, who pitched the day before  for the Texas Rangers.    One of them, 40-year-old Cecil Cooper, says that's OK. "When he starts playing  in them, I won't anymore," Cooper said. "You think I want to face that  90-mile-an-hour fastball?"    Toiling in obscurity: While most of Italy braced itself for Sunday's round of  World Cup soccer games, Richard Olsen concentrated on other things.    The 33-year old Hawaiian-born right-hander, a former minor leaguer with the  Milwaukee Brewers' triple-A Vancouver franchise from 1979-82, pitched a partita  perfetta (perfect game) for Grosseto of the Italian league, striking out 18 in  a 7-0 victory over Turin.    "No matter where it happens, it's a great feeling," Olsen told the Associated  Press. "I've never seen a perfect game . . . it's hard to even imagine throwing  one."    In a game last season, Olsen retired the first 24 batters, but his teammates  let him down. Italian rules state that if a team has a 10-run lead after seven  innings, the game is over. Grosseto led, 10-0, at the time.    Trivia answer: Red Barber.    Quotebook: Charles Barkley, on receiving the most votes for the NBA  all-interview team: "I say what I think.

headline:   L.A. GAMES;    NO. 1 LONG BEACH POLY SUBDUES VENICE, 64-52   
text:   The field of high school basketball teams narrowed considerably in the third  round of the 23rd L.A. Games Sunday at El Camino College.    In pairings that resemble an NCAA tournament, the competition began Saturday  with 128 boys' teams and 64 girls' teams, making this the largest event of its  kind in the nation.    By Sunday's end there were only 16 boys' teams and eight girls' teams to  advance to the fourth round next Saturday.    Long Beach Poly, the No. 1-seeded team in the tournament and this year's  Southern Section 5-AA champion, held on to beat Venice, 64-52. In the first  half, Poly dominated the court with its fast-break play and rebounding ability.    At one point, Venice made a 12-3 run on Poly in the second half. That brought  the Gondoliers to within eight points, but it was as close as they would get.    Poly's starters returned with two minutes to play, putting an end to the Venice  offensive.    "I thought they'd be better, that it would be a harder game for us," senior  Yakim Craddock said.    The 6-3 guard scored 29 points. Tyus Edney added 22 points and 10 assists.    Craddock will be leading the team next season as some of Poly's best players  have graduated, including Willie McGinest, who accepted a scholarship to play  football at USC.    "If I had the (ball) handling down, I think (recruiters) would be starting to  look at me a little more," Craddock said.    Said Coach Ron Palmer: "(Craddock) dominated the game for us.    "Most of the bench will be freshman and sophomores," the coach added. "I have  17 kids out here and some of them will play junior varsity, but I want to give  them as much playing experience as I can."    Palmer coached his team to victory in the 1979 games.    "I always come into these games with a little bit of guarded optimism because  the city teams play in a (20-game) spring league, giving them an advantage."    Meanwhile, eighth-seeded Reseda Cleveland advanced to the fourth round by  routing Hamilton, 62-40.    Cleveland's participation in the games came as a surprise after the resignation  of coach Marc Paez in early June.    Varsity assistant Bart Ostoco took over as interim coach for the games. Because  he has been the school's junior varsity coach, he knows the kids moving up to  the varsity level.    "Our strongest points are our intensity and concentration," Ostoco said.    Brandon Martin, a 6-3 1/2 shooting guard, scored 16 points, and 6-5 forward  Kayed Murray added 10 while playing an excellent defensive game.    "The inexperienced guys came in when the seniors weren't playing well and did  their job," Ostoco said.    Cleveland has been a city playoff contender in recent years, but will have only  four returning starters.    La Canada has been the surprise thus far in the tournament, upsetting  seventh-seeded Dorsey in the first round. The Spartans went on to defeat Bell  Gardens and Taft to advance into a match against 10th-seeded Morningside in the  fourth round.    In the girls' division, Washington edged Torrance, 24-22. Charisse Sampson had  16 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and four blocked shots for Washington.    Powerful Lynwood has outscored opponents by 70 points in breezing to three  victories.

headline:   WINNING MAKES A BELIEVER OF BROWN IN PRO SURF FINAL   
text:   People were telling Santa Barbara's Chris Brown he had won the $50,000 Killer  Loop surfing tournament Sunday at the Oceanside Pier long before the judges  made it official.    Brown refused to believe.    He chose to assume he had lost, just in case.    But Oceanside's Mike Lambresi, the three-time champion of the Professional  Surfing Assn. of America, predicted Brown would win.    "He's on for the tournament, not to mention, he's the most naturally gifted  surfer on the (U.S.) tour," said Lambresi, who was eliminated in the semifinals  earlier Sunday.    Still, Brown wasn't taking anything for granted. At least until the winner was  announced after Sunday's finals.    Today, Brown can deposit a check for $7,300 -- his earnings for winning the  fifth stop on the Bud Pro Surfing Tour. He also earned 1,000 points and moved  into first place on the tour with 3,148, four more than Charlie Kuhn of Indian  Harbor Beach, Fla., who was third.    Fan favorite Rob Machado, a 16-year-old senior at San Dieguito High, was second  in the 40-minute final.    Brown, 19, won his second tour event in his first final of the season. His  first victory was in 1988 in an Irvine man-made wave pool.    "This is far more pleasing," he said.    A controversial interference call on Newport Beach's Richie Collins in one  semifinal cost him a chance to advance. Without the major penalty, Collins  probably would have won the heat. Still, he nearly won despite only getting  points for his best three waves instead of the normal four.    In the Body Glove Bodyboarding division, three-time U.S. champion Mike Stewart  of Anaheim won a close final over Hawaii's Harry Antipala (second place), Ben  Severson (third) and Kyle Maligro (fourth). Stewart, who earned $2,075, won for  the 27th time in 52 contests.

headline:   WELCH'S SPEEDY RECOVERY LEADS TO TRIATHLON VICTORY   
text:   Three weeks ago Greg Welch was in Phoenix with fellow Australian Simon  Skillicorn. The two were preparing for a triathlon, eyeing the course a day  before the race when the car they were parked in was broadsided by another car  being driven at 50 m.p.h.    Skillicorn suffered a broken neck. Welch came away with two cracked ribs and  two more separated from the spine.    No, they didn't run the next day. Skillicorn won't be running for quite some  time and on Friday when doctors looked at Welch's X-rays, they advised him not  to even train.    But there was Welch, all smiles, no indication of fatigue and giving the  thumbs-up sign in the middle of the 10-kilometer run along Harbor Drive, the  last event in Sunday's Mountain Dew Sport San Diego International Triathlon.    Sure, doctors said don't train, but they didn't bar him from competing. So  Welch competed.    At that midway point in the 10K, Welch had a 30-second lead over Miles Stewart,  also from Australia, and Scott Molina of Boulder, Colo. It was more than  apparent he was going to win the race, which also consisted of a one-kilometer  swim and 30 kilometers on bike. Welch, 25, did so in a course record of  1:27:27.    Scott Tinley's old record was 1:27:42.    "That was for Simon," Welch said after the victory. "I did it all for him."    Welch was not the only one to set a course record and then proceed to tell a  story about how quickly the human body can mend itself. Paula Newby-Fraser's  story is not so dramatic.    By finishing in 1:34:56, Newby-Fraser, a Zimbabwe transplant who now lives in  Encinitas, eclipsed her own course record of 1:37:16.    As it was for Welch, this was a surprise considering Newby-Fraser spent the  previous six days recovering from the Nice Triathlon, which she won just a week  ago.    And recover is the applicable word. It took Newby-Fraser 6 1/2 hours to finish  the Nice event, which consisted of four kilometers in water, 75 miles on bike  and 20 miles on foot.    By winning in France, Newby-Fraser cashed a $12,000 check. For winning in San  Diego, she earned $1,500, as did Welch. The second-place finishers, Stewart  (1:27:55) and Erin Baker (1:37:53), got $1,000 and the third-place finishers,  Scott Molina (1:28:04) and Joan Alley (1:41:15), picked up $750.

headline:   TEXAS SWIMMERS TOO MUCH FOR EAST GERMAN SQUAD   
text:   Longhorn Aquatics of Austin, Tex., pulled away from the field on the final day  of the Charlotte UltraSwim competition as it won the men's, women's and  combined titles.    The nearest team in each category was East Germany's squad for the Goodwill  Games.    Longhorn won the men's competition, 960-558, over East Germany, 960-558; the  women's, 1,181-731; and the combined, 2,141-1,289.    The meet featured the full 22-member East German team and 15 members of the  U.S. team which will compete in the Goodwill Games next month in Seattle.    East German swimmers broke 17 meet records during the four-day competition, and  earned more than $3,000 in prize money.    The Mecklenburg Aquatic Club in Charlotte establishes a $100 prize for each  meet record and adds another $100 for each year the meet record stands. Most of  the records broken by the East Germans were two years old.    The East Germans set meet records Sunday night in the men's and women's  1500-meter freestyles. Grit Muller touched first in the women's race in 16  minutes, 36.91 seconds, and Joerg Hoffman won his third event in 15:41.56. East  German men won every individual event Sunday as Christian Gessner won the men's  200 individual medley in 2:05.48 and Tino Weber took the 200 backstroke in  2:03.31, both meet record times. Ingolf Rasch spoiled the return of U.S.  Olympic silver medalist Chris Jacobs in the 100 freestyle as he touched in  52.72, .29 seconds ahead of Jacobs.    Another Olympian, Erika Hansen, kept the East Germans from a Sunday sweep,  winning the 200 individual medley in 2:19.37 with Nicole Haislett, of St.  Petersburg, Fla., second in 2:21.35.    U.S. Olympian Doug Gjertsen and Hansen were the high point winners of the meet,  Gjertsen earning 107 points and Hansen 143.

headline:   NATIONAL ROUNDUP;    MISTAURIAN EASILY WINS VAGRANCY   
text:   Mistaurian joined the leaders entering the stretch, then drew away to a 7  1/4-length victory over Feel The Beat in the $83,400 Vagrancy Handicap Sunday  at Belmont Park.    Ridden by Herb McCauley and carrying 113 pounds, Mistaurian had to go wide at  the turn but easily won the race for older fillies and mares, returning $9.40,  $3.80 and $2.10.    Feel The Beat, ridden by Chris Antley, led until Mistaurian's move and was  three-quarters of a length ahead of favorite Fantastic Find under Craig Perret  in the field of five. Spotty Hot and Wonchindordor were the trailers.    Mistaurian, owned by Bernard Chaus, covered seven furlongs on a fast track in  1:25 1/5. Her third victory in six starts this year was worth $50,040.    Jockey Rick Moss suffered an ankle injury when his mount, Phoenix Sunshine,  stumbled and fell, causing two other horses to go down during the $109,900  Locust Grove at Churchill Downs.    Dibs, with Aaron Gryder aboard, was well outside the pileup and drew off for a  two-length victory over City Crowds.    Dibs covered the 1 1/8 miles over the turf in 1:50 3/5 and paid $15.80, $5.60  and $2.80.    Clever Trevor, ridden by Don Pettinger, made his turf debut a successful one at  Arlington International Racecourse, winning a $28,000 allowance race over one  mile in 1:36.1.    The victory was the second in a row this year for Clever Trevor and increased  his lifetime record to 12 victories in 19 starts. He has earned $1.05 million.

headline:   FROST FREE HEATS UP, ENDS SKID;    OTHER RACES: AFTER THREE DISAPPOINTING EFFORTS, GELDING GOES WIRE-TO-WIRE IN  $156,000 HOLLYWOOD PARK RACE.   
text:   Trainer John Sadler didn't need his ace to win the $156,600 Hollywood Park  Budweiser Breeders' Cup Sunday.    With Olympic Prospect, who won the first running of the event two years  earlier, sitting this one out, Frost Free went wire-to-wire, holding off  Coastal Voyage and favored Sam Who.    After disappointing in his previous three races, the 5-year-old It's Freezing  gelding broke on top under Gary Stevens, relaxed well on the lead and had  enough left to win in 1:08 1/5 for the six furlongs on turf.    After capturing his first two starts of 1990, Frost Free had finished fifth as  the 8-5 favorite in his initial try on the turf, the Sierra Madre Handicap  March 21 at Santa Anita, then was fourth in both the Triple Bend Handicap and  Golden Gate's Oakland Handicap.    Sadler felt he had excuses for those three races and he was encouraged by Frost  Free's recent works. He worked five furlongs on the grass in :59 3/5 June 14,  then blew out a half-mile in 46 flat last Wednesday.    "The reason I thought he could handle this turf course is that it's so much  different than Santa Anita's," said Sadler after Frost Free's $17.80 upset.  "This is a very firm course. Santa Anita's is a lot looser, especially coming  down the hill.    "Speed also had been looking very good on it this week and the main thing is I  wanted a track he could get a hold of.    "He couldn't handle the track at all at Golden Gate (May 28). It was really  slow. He's perfect in the slop, but that was a heavy, drying out track. It was  very, very deep and he couldn't handle it."    Maybe, the return to Stevens was also a factor. The rider is now unbeaten in  five collaborations with Frost Free.    "He's one of the quickest gate horses I've ridden, so I felt pretty confident  I'd be on the lead," he said. "It was just a super race. He did everything  right. I still think he's a little better on the dirt than he is on the turf.  He handled it well today, but he bobbled a few times on the turn. He's all  fight."    Coastal Voyage, the 5-2 second choice, was a nose better than Sam Who, the  beaten favorite in his first two starts of the year. He lacked room briefly on  the turn, but Laffit Pincay had no excuses for the Lypheor gelding.    Round Sovereign was fourth, then came Major Current, Pentelicus, Ofanto,  Weldnaas, Colway Rally, Wonder Dancer and Somormujo.    The Gold Cup wasn't the only stakes success for Wayne Lukas Sunday at Hollywood  Park.    Two races before, he was in the winner's circle after the $106,500 Princess  Stakes, which was hardly a shock. After all, he saddled three of the five  entrants.    What was surprising was which 3-year-old filly was standing there with him. A  Wild Ride, a 9-1 shot, rallied from last to beat Golden Reef and her two more  highly-regarded stablemates, Patches and Hail Atlantis.    Winless since beating Dominant Dancer in the Junior Miss Stakes last August at  Del Mar, A Wild Ride was last for the first six furlongs under Jose Santos,  rallied along the rail, collared pacesetter Golden Reef with less than a  sixteenth of a mile and was drawing away at the finish. The official margin was  two lengths and she completed the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 4/5.    Fourth, third and second in three sprint starts this year, A Wild Ride made it  a double for Calumet Farm, which also owns Criminal Type.    "I thought it might get a little hot up front, so I told Jose to be patient,"  said Lukas, who seemed genuinely startled at the outcome. "I thought he rode a  real heady race because they were smokin' pretty good.    "I had a sneaking hunch that (Golden Reef) might go and that left Jose as the  only late-runner and that's the way it came out."    In her first try around two turns, Golden Reef, the 3-1 third choice, looked  like a winner most of the way, but she weakened in the final furlong.    "She was very relaxed, but she was trying to get out with me all the way," said  Eddie Delahoussaye. "He (trainer Chris Speckert) might try her in blinkers next  time."

headline:   JAPANESE CRITIC SAYS U.S. HOLDS TRADE-GAP KEY   
text:   Shintaro Ishihara, author of the controversial book "The Japan That Can Say  No," has presented his own 109 demands for American economic reform and warned  that opening the Japanese market, by itself, would not eliminate the trade  imbalance between the two nations.    Ishihara told foreign correspondents Friday that he agrees with U.S.  negotiators who are demanding that Japan dramatically increase spending on  public works to improve living standards and pull in imports. Japan's closed  markets should also be opened to give Japanese consumers a better life, he  added.    But he said that whatever reforms Japan promises to undertake in the yearlong  Structural Impediments Initiative talks won't be enough, by themselves, to  reduce the United States's $49-billion trade imbalance with Japan. The  negotiations are designed to remove trade barriers.    "The United States must regain its competitiveness and make products in America  that will sell. . . . The United States conducts 10 times the basic research,  which is the foundation of technology, that Japan does but cannot turn that  research into products. That is the fault of management," Ishihara said.    "It's also a fault of the U.S. political system. . . . The U.S. government must  get more involved.'    Ishihara, known as a gadfly within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party,  said the LDP, preferring to "leave everything to the bureaucrats," had snubbed  his list of proposed American reforms.    The novelist-turned-politician attracted wide attention last summer when "The  Japan That Can Say No," a book he co-authored with Sony Chairman Akio Morita,  was translated into English without his permission. In the book, which stirred  widespread resentment in Congress, he advocated that Japan use its  technological prowess as a diplomatic weapon.    A sequel, written without Morita, called "Nevertheless, Japan Can Still Say  No," is No. 1 on the Asahi newspaper's list of best-selling business books.    American and Japanese negotiators will meet here today and Tuesday to work on a  final report on the Structural Impediments Initiative talks, which President  Bush has made the focus of his economic policy toward Japan.    Ishihara pointed out Friday that American proposals for rejuvenating U.S.  industry -- the latest is "Made in America," by the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology -- have been coming out one after another for more than five years.  "But the U.S. Administration and Congress have done nothing to implement them,"  he said.    Japanese proposals in the SII talks for American reforms, he complained, have  been too moderate and lacked specifics.    Ishihara suggested that the United States spend 5% of its gross national  product on education, carry out an "action program" to reduce consumption,  enact a national sales tax and offer broad tax exemptions on personal savings  -- similar to those that Japan abandoned in April, 1988, to promote  consumption.    Noting that the United States is demanding that Japanese banks operate their  automated teller machines 24 hours a day to promote consumption, Ishihara said  ATM operations in the United States should be curtailed to 12 hours a day to  restrain consumption.    He also called for "dramatic" cuts in American nuclear weaponry and overseas  bases.

headline:   DEALS: MARKET WATCH;    THE FISCHBACH CURSE CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM   
text:   If there ever was a company with a curse on it, it has to be Fischbach Corp.,  the New York-based electrical contracting company. Not only has Fischbach  itself been devastated by the takeover shenanigans of the 1980s, but so have  the key players involved in the 1985 takeover of the company by Victor Posner,  corporate carnivore and convicted felon.    And now, yet another victim seems to be spattered by the mud that seems to  besmirch everyone who comes near Fischbach: American International Group, and  its chairman, Maurice (Hank) Greenberg. AIG, a huge, successful insurance  holding company, is buying Fischbach for $11 a share. Greenberg is one of the  most respected and astute executives in the insurance industry.    The AIG takeover of Fischbach is a very unusual transaction, to say the least.  AIG is buying Fischbach for $44 million, stuffing some of Fischbach's  operations and Fischbach's new business into a company to be managed and 51%  owned by Peter Kiewit Sons Inc. of Omaha and keeping some existing Fischbach  business and other assets. If you have trouble grasping this, join the club.  You don't see $44-million deals this complicated every day. Thank God.    Let me stress that Greenberg's Fischbach problem isn't remotely comparable to  those of the other people who have been tarred by Fischbach: Ivan F. Boesky,  Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Posner.    These players have big, big legal problems; all but Posner copped guilty pleas  to securities fraud involving Fischbach. Posner, who pleaded guilty to criminal  tax fraud in an unrelated case, faces possible indictment. Plus, as you may  recall, all these players lost money in the Fischbach follies.    AIG and Greenberg don't have any legal problem that I can see. But I think that  a company with AIG's reputation ought to disclose certain facts, unpleasant as  they may be, and ought to engage in open dealing with Fischbach's shareholders.  Not to mention AIG's.    I couldn't get Greenberg to talk to me. AIG -- in the form of John Wooster Jr.,  vice president of communications -- says it doesn't see any problem.    Let me tell you what's going on, and you can draw your own conclusion.    AIG says it's buying Fischbach to protect itself against losses in the $500  million of construction surety bonding that it has outstanding to Fischbach.  This bonding guarantees Fischbach's customers that money will be available to  finish a job if Fischbach can't or doesn't complete it. No bonding, no new  business.    After Posner took over Fischbach in 1985, its bonding company, a subsidiary of  Chubb, resigned the account. It didn't want to do business with a company  controlled by Posner, who has a well-deserved reputation for taking excessive  salaries and for putting his personal interests ahead of the interest of his  companies' employees, customers, vendors and stockholders.    Many, if not most, of the major bonding companies also refused to do business  with Posner-controlled Fischbach.    AIG took over the business in 1986. Guess what. It's having so much trouble  getting paid that it had to take out second mortgages on Fischbach properties  to ensure payment of more than $20 million of past-due premiums, ad to lend  Fischbach money to keep it afloat -- and now has to go through a complicated  and expensive takeover of its client to protect itself against losses on the  policies that the client took out.    And Fischbach, it turns out, isn't just any piece of insurance business. It was  business brought to AIG by Mel Harris, an insurance broker at Alexander &amp;  Alexander in Miami.    Harris, a big producer at A&amp;A, is related to Greenberg's wife -- they're  cousins -- and socializes with Greenberg.    Harris says that, despite his relationship with the Greenbergs, none of his  business -- including the Fischbach business -- got any special treatment from  AIG's underwriters. "Being a cousin of Mrs. Greenberg is not of any value when  you are dealing with the surety department of AIG," Harris said wryly.    Harris' statement notwithstanding, the Harris-Greenberg relationship strikes me  as a piece of information that I would like to have if I owned stock in either  Fischbach or AIG. To me, it looks bad not to have disclosed this relationship,  because it looks like AIG is hiding something. I also would be curious whether  AIG has gotten Alexander &amp; Alexander to bear part of AIG's effort and  expense in tending to the Fischbach account.    AIG's answer: There is no legal requirement to disclose any of this. And AIG PR  man Wooster asserts that the Fischbach business was treated by AIG the way  similar business is treated.    I'm sure.    When I asked Wooster how many other times AIG has had to spend more than $40  million to buy a customer to protect itself against insurance losses, he said  that question was outside the Fischbach transaction, and he wouldn't answer it.    Once upon a time, Fischbach was a proud, productive and profitable company that  helped build electric generating plants, trash-to-energy plants and other  facilities that society needs. Thanks to the fancy and illegal dancing that  went on, the company and the people who helped Posner buy it were destroyed.    After this deal goes through, there probably will be plenty of Fischbach  employees' blood on the streets as Kiewit slashes the work force. When that's  over, though, there is a reasonable chance that Fischbach, in its Kiewit-AIG  incarnation, will be proud, productive and profitable again.    It's a pity, though, that a once-fine company that has been under a cloud for  so many years is losing its independence under a cloud. But, given the  Fischbach Curse, it was probably to be expected.

headline:   MARKET WATCH;    REGULATORS' PLAN TO MAKE BANK TRUSTS MORE ACCESSIBLE SPARKS BATTLE;    SECURITIES: INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO ADVERTISE THE ACCOUNTS AND CHARGE  WHATEVER FEES STATES PERMIT. MUTUAL FUND OPERATORS ARE IRATE.   
text:   The trust departments of banks, traditionally the venue of the rich if not the  famous, may be about to become accessible to the merely prosperous -- a  prospect that has the mutual fund industry crying foul.    Under regulations proposed by federal bank regulators, national banks would be  able to start advertising trust accounts and charging fees in whatever way  state laws permit. By setting up trusts in a way that will appeal to small  investors and promoting them to the public, banks would be able to market them  to people looking for an investment vehicle, according to opponents.    The effect, according to these critics, would be to subordinate the traditional  trust aspects of these accounts and put banks into the mutual fund business.    "The proposed rule represents a frontal assault" on congressional restrictions  on banks' activities in the area of stocks, bonds and other securities, said a  letter from the Investment Company Institute, a mutual-fund trade group,  commenting on the regulations.    The rules offer the potential for a new competitor in the money-management  field, one that could offer convenience, efficiency and, based on past  performance, outstanding investment value.    At the same time, however, the rules raise the possibility that confused  investors, as happened with the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., will  think that they are putting their money into a federally insured deposit when  they are not.    The rules have been proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,  an agency of the Treasury Department that regulates national banks. The OCC is  accepting public comments on the issue until July 7 and will then consider  whether to make the regulations final.    The proposal has stirred widespread concern on Capitol Hill. Members ranging  from House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) to House  Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) have written  to the regulators expressing concern.    Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and several other members criticized the  "granting of Lincoln-type securities powers, with no corresponding safeguards."    Since the 1930s, the Glass-Steagall Act and other laws have sharply restricted  bank activities outside their traditional businesses of taking deposits and  making loans. But banks argue that these restrictions are obsolete and hamper  their efforts to compete effectively with giant foreign banks. Many bankers  would like to get into not only the mutual fund business but also insurance and  securities generally.    The OCC's proposal does not sit well with members of Congress, who view it as  an end run.    With questions about the solvency of bank deposit insurance funds and the  experience with savings and loans, "Why would you do anything that would add  risk?" asked one congressional staff member familiar with the issue. "It just  makes no sense."    Another staffer noted that although trust accounts are not insured, "if these  things run amok, are we exposing the deposit insurance fund to a huge  liability?"    A spokeswoman for the OCC said, however, that the rules changes are not that  dramatic and do no more than put national banks "on a par with state banks,"  many of which already have these powers.    At issue in the rules are so-called common trusts, which are investment pools  operated by banks so that they can manage relatively small trust accounts  efficiently. If a trust account is large enough, it can be managed as a  separate entity, but smaller sums would be eaten up by fees if handled  separately.    Thus, regulators have for many years allowed banks to pool smaller trust  accounts and manage them together.    But trust accounts are more than simple investment vehicles. They involve a  fiduciary relationship that requires the bank to manage the money prudently and  with only the interests of the beneficiary in mind, much as the trustees of a  pension fund must watch over investments on behalf of current and future  pensioners.    The new rules would leave most regulation of these funds to the states, which  opponents see as tantamount to no regulation at all.    "The proposed rule is intended to convert bank common trust funds from  administrative devices into mutual fund vehicles used to sell collective  money-management services to the public for a profit," the Investment Company  Institute letter charges.    Some small banks oppose the rules, but other small banks and most big banks  want the change. And they dispute the ICI's charges.    "I only wish (the proposed rules) would let us into the mutual fund business  because we want to be in the mutual fund business, but this isn't the vehicle  for it," said James D. McLaughlin of the American Bankers Assn.    Marketing common trust services "to the masses" would bring banks afoul of the  Securities and Exchange Commission, he said.

headline:   MARKET BEAT: MARKET WATCH;    GERMAN ISSUES: EXPECT PAYOFF MUCH LATER   
text:   The West German stock market has suddenly come back to life after a dismal  spring. That's stirring new interest in the market on the part of U.S.  investors, who are remembering all those post-Berlin Wall stories about the  united Germany's dynamic future as the economic leader of the "new Europe."    Should you have money invested in German stocks? Yes, most global market  strategists will tell you. Will you have to wait awhile for your payoff? Most  likely, yes. But to try and time the turn of events in Germany would probably  be futile. When that market moves, it moves very quickly.    In the first quarter of this year, the West German market was the world's  hottest. From January 1 to April 2, the Frankfurt exchange's 30-share DAX index  rose 10%, to 1,976.43. In the same period, the U.S. market fell 3.4% and  Japan's plunged 26%.    But just as the U.S. and Japanese markets rebounded in the spring, Germany's  stagnated. Steve Keddell, who handles big U.S. investors' trades of German  stocks for Deutsche Bank in New York, notes that the German market was hit by a  number of problems at once: concerns about the cost of unification; rising  interest rates; a strong Deutschemark, which hurt export profits, and turmoil  in Brazil, a big market for German firms.    Those problems sent the DAX down to 1,787.39 by June 13. Then, last week,  buyers returned, boosting the DAX 80.66 points for the week to 1,872.92 on  Friday.    Is this the start of a new surge? That's probably up to American and Japanese  investors. Because the German stock market is relatively small, "in the short  term, what drives German stocks is the action of outsiders" who suddenly throw  large sums at the stocks, says George Murnaghan. He runs two international  stock mutual funds for T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.    Some American investors believe that relief over the economic cementing of East  Germany with the West on July 2 -- via East Germany's conversion to West  Germany's currency -- could precipitate a flood of money into German stocks.  "The market could rebound violently," says Frank Jennings, who runs American  International Group's $500-million international investment portfolio.    On the surface, German stocks don't appear overpriced. Keddell says the average  stock on the Frankfurt exchange sells for 14 times estimated 1990 earnings per  share, about on par with U.S. stocks and well below Japan's still-lofty  price/earnings ratios.    The big question now is whether West German companies will be able to show  decent profit growth this year and next. Keddell admits that his expectations  are coming down. "We originally expected 12% (average) earnings growth this  year, but we now see 9%," he says. And for 1991, he sees just 7%.    The problem is that no one knows what West German companies will have to invest  to revitalize their East German counterparts, as unification proceeds. There is  a growing realization, however, that "these companies will have to spend a lot  of money before they can earn anything," Keddell says.    George Noble, one of Fidelity Group's key international stock managers, toured  the two Germanys earlier this month. He returned to the United States sobered  about chances of a fast payoff from unification. In fact, Noble cut back a bit  on his Overseas Fund's position in German stocks.    The East German economy is a shambles, he says. Its plants are grossly  inefficient. Officials at a West German auto parts plant told Noble about an  Eastern counterpart that employs 800 people. The Western plant produces as much  with 150.    Everyone knows there's a huge bill that the West Germans will have to pay to  rebuild the East. The German stock market may even be prepared for little or no  earnings growth by German firms this year and next, as capital spending soars.  The big unknown, says Noble, is whether social upheaval in the East will lead  to rioting. That could panic foreign investors.    "I think you're going to see unemployment be a real problem," he says. Add the  potential for interest rates to remain high -- as the two Germanys borrow  massively to fund unification -- and Noble believes German stocks could slide  further this year.    But beyond the short-term gloom, he says he is convinced that the German market  could one day be the world's best -- because German economic power is certain  to be pre-eminent in Europe. If you think you can time the market, good luck.  The smartest investors will probably put money into German stocks this year,  and vow not to touch them for three years minimum.

headline:   DR. NEIL SOLOMON: LISTING OILS IN FOODS   
text:   Question: I sometimes see labels on food packages that list a number of  different kinds of oil that may be present in the product, but it doesn't say  which particular one is used. Are food manufacturers permitted to do this?  Reading the label doesn't do much good if I still don't know what the food  contains.    Answer: Food and Drug Administration regulations permit manufacturers to list a  number of oils that may be contained in a food when the oil is not the major  ingredient. The manufacturer thus has the freedom to use a different oil at  different times. However, for foods in which oil is the major ingredient, the  manufacturer must list it by its common name, such as lard or coconut oil.

headline:   MANY SEPTIC TANK USERS STILL PAYING SEWER FEES;    UTILITY: SEVERAL PACOIMA FAMILIES FILE CLAIMS WITH THE CITY. BUT OFFICIALS SAY  THAT EVEN IF REFUNDS ARE GRANTED, THEY WILL BE FOR 12 MONTHS ONLY.   
text:   Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of mostly low-income Los Angeles residents  whose homes are connected to septic tanks have been paying more than $100  annually in sewer fees for as long as 12 years because they are unaware that  they must ask the city to stop billing them.    The residents, many of them immigrants who speak little or no English,  apparently have not noticed or do not understand annual English-only water bill  inserts explaining how to be exempted from sewer fees, city officials  acknowledge. Otherwise, the fees -- averaging $10.43 per month for a  single-family dwelling -- are billed to water customers automatically.    Even if an exemption is granted, the city will refund charges only for the 12  months preceding the date it was requested, officials said. Thus, a septic tank  user who unwittingly has been paying the fees since Los Angeles began assessing  them to residential customers in 1978 could have forfeited hundreds of dollars.    "It's like the city is robbing me -- just like in Mexico," said Pedro  Velasquez, a Pacoima gardener who estimates he has paid about $600 in sewer  fees since buying his home in 1985. He learned in January that he was entitled  to an exemption.    On Friday, lawyers with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services filed a  claim with the city on behalf of Velasquez and seven other Pacoima residents  seeking reimbursement for unwarranted sewer fees. The claimant who has paid the  fees the longest, Robert Alvarez, bought his home on Brownell Street in 1981  and has never been hooked up to the sewer.    The problem arises because the city charges sewer fees to water customers based  on the amount of water consumed, on the theory that a portion of the water ends  up in the sewage system.    But the city does not know which water customers are connected to sewers  because parcel maps showing sewer connections are often outdated or inaccurate,  said Fred Hoeptner, a senior civil engineer with the Los Angeles Department of  Public Works waste water management division.    The city would have to send inspectors to each of the 733,380 parcels in Los  Angeles to determine which are on the sewer system, he said. Until such a count  is made, the city will continue to bill septic tank users for sewer service  unless they seek an exemption, he said.    Department of Public Works officials estimate that there are 590,000 sewer  hookups and that 3% of the city's residents live in dwellings served by septic  tanks.    Fred Nakamura, the attorney who filed the claim with the city, said many  low-income renters who pay their own water bills might not know whether the  property has a septic tank or sewer service and are continuing to pay the fees.    Neither Nakamura nor city officials could estimate how many people qualify for  the exemptions but have not asked for them.    The claim submitted on behalf of the eight Pacoima residents, who live along a  stretch of Brownell Street that has no sewer access, says the current billing  system violates state unfair business-practice and other laws.    Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the northeast  Valley, said he agrees that the billing system should be changed. "I think  administratively it's easier, but whether it's fair or not is another  question," he said.    The residents intend to sue the city if the claim is denied, a result that  Nakamura said is likely. Nakamura said the lawsuit would contend that the city  intentionally misled customers and that the plaintiffs were falsely led to  believe the fee was appropriate because public agencies are expected to obey  the law.    The claim filed Friday grew out of an unsuccessful effort by Brownell Street  resident Esteban Gallardo, 46, to obtain a sewer-fee exemption. According to  Gallardo, the Department of Water and Power threatened to cut off water to his  house, which he has rented since 1986, if he refused to pay the fee.    Last December, Gallardo mentioned the problem to neighbor Graciela Lopez, who  advised him to contact the legal-aid organization.    After Nakamura and other legal-aid attorneys heard Gallardo's story, they  knocked on doors in the man's neighborhood to see if others had the same  problem.    Like Gallardo, who is unemployed and on welfare, many of the claimants are poor  and speak little or no English. Many of them rent the small, ranch-style houses  whose loosely tended front yards are marked by square, wood septic tank lids.    Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. John Haggerty, who represents the Department of  Public Works, denied that the city has violated any laws. He said the city code  clearly states that residents may seek only a year's worth of damages when  making claims.    But for the residents of Brownell Street who are seeking refunds, there was  nothing proper about the way their money ended up in city coffers.    "We didn't know until January" that the sewer fees were not required, said  Margarita Velasquez, 17, Pedro Velasquez's daughter. "We were very upset. They  were charging us for something we didn't have."

headline:   SCIENCE / MEDICINE;    STOCKPILE OF ONE'S OWN BLOOD IS THE SAFEST OPTION WHEN FACING SURGERY   
text:   Anyone preparing for elective surgery who may need a blood transfusion should  look into stockpiling his own blood. The case for self-donated, or autologous,  blood is simple: Because it carries no risk of infection, your own blood is the  safest blood you can get.    However, while the American Medical Assn., the American Red Cross, and the Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) all recommend the use of autologous blood, only a  minority of the 18 million transfusions performed annually are self-donated --  largely because too few patients are informed of this valuable alternative.    Autologous blood donation started to gain popularity several years back,  primarily because of the risk of being infected with the AIDS-causing HIV virus  during transfusion.    This risk has faded since a screening test for HIV, introduced in 1985, greatly  reduced the possibility of receiving AIDS-contaminated blood. Your chances of  contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion fall somewhere between 1 in 75,000 to  1 in 500,000 per unit of blood, depending on whether blood comes from an area  with high or low incidence of AIDS.    More effective screening methods continue to lessen the risk of acquiring  illness from a transfusion using donor (homologous) blood. Just this past May,  the FDA approved a test to screen donor blood for hepatitis C, also called non  A/non B hepatitis. (Since earlier screens had reduced contamination from  hepatitis B, hepatitis C has been responsible for 90% transfusion-acquired  hepatitis.)    However, recent research suggests that donor transfusions may suppress the  immune system, increasing the risk of postsurgical infection. One study,  presented at a recent meeting of the American Assn. of Blood Banks, followed  the postsurgical infection rates of 105 hip replacement patients.    None of those in either the transfusion-free or autologously transfused groups  acquired any infection, while 23% of the homologously transfused patients did.  It seems that autologous blood -- which naturally poses no threat to your  immune system -- allows the immune system to place its energies into getting  you well rather than fighting suspicious foreign blood particles.    One deterrent of autologous donation is that, despite iron supplementation,  many donors become anemic before an adequate amount of blood is stored because  their body does not replace the depleted red blood cell (RBC) supply fast  enough. On average, an "adequate supply" usually requires that three to four  pints of "units" be donated in the month before surgery. (Fully stocked, the  body's blood supply is about 9.5 pints.)    Fortunately, new genetic technology may make it easier to store that much  blood. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found  that the anemia was the result of insufficient levels of the hormone  erythropoietin, or EPO. Produced by the kidneys in response to a decrease in  RBCs, EPC acts as a red flag and alerts bone marrow to produce more RBCs.    This multicenter study showed that administering genetically manufactured EPO  intravenously allowed 96% of patients treated to store enough blood without  becoming anemic.    The down side: At the moment, treatment costs are high -- about $2,500 a  patient -- and, because the procedure is still investigational, insurance  companies have not yet established a policy on reimbursement. Other ongoing  studies are examining the effects of lower-dose therapy, which should bring  costs down.    When autologous donations are not an option, as in an emergency or in  operations such as open-heart surgery that involve massive blood loss, another  option for utilizing your own blood is a technique known as intraoperative  autologous transfusion (IAT). In this procedure, blood lost during the surgery  is collected and recycled through a machine that filters and cleans it, and  then feeds it back into your circulatory system. However, because of the  possibility of contamination, intraoperative transfusions are not used for  open-bowel surgeries, cancer operations, or cases where there is an infection  at the site of the surgery.    A well-marketed option -- donating your blood now, and then freezing and  storing it for possible later use -- is definitely not good transfusion  insurance. One obstacle is the cost: Red Cross and hospital blood banks do not  have enough storage space to hold frozen blood indefinitely, and commercial  blood banks charge up to $275 a unit.    Transport is another problem: If you need blood in an emergency and are not  near your stored supply, considerable expense is incurred in shipment, and the  blood, which will take 90 minutes to thaw once your surgeon has it, might very  well not get to you in time anyway.    Once thawed, blood must be discarded after 24 hours -- and after three years of  storage in the freezer, it must be discarded whether it is used or not.    In some cases, a homologous transfusion is unavoidable. "While autologous  transfusions are the only way to guarantee 100% transfusion safety, and should  always be encouraged," said Dr. Paul Ness, director of the Johns Hopkins Blood  Bank, "if you do need blood, the homologous blood supply has never been safer."    If you are scheduled for elective surgery that might require a blood  transfusion, make every effort to donate autologously. Even if you are able to  make only a partial donation, that will minimize the amount of blood needed  from the donor pool and so may cut your transfusion risk.    Donating autologously might mean extra footwork -- not all hospitals collect  autologously, but most area blood centers will -- and extra cost (more tracking  and paper work add an average of $40 a unit to the bill, which not all  insurance companies will cover). However, improved safety may far outweigh  these considerations.    DONATING BLOOD TO YOURSELF    * Different surgeries require different amounts: When discussing elective  surgery with your doctor, ask if you are likely to need a transfusion, and how  much blood your surgery typically requires.    Some surgeries that commonly require transfusions: open heart surgery (up to 6  units); orthopedic surgery (2 to 4 units); gynecological surgery (around 2  units).    * Schedule far in advance: Try to schedule your surgery far enough in advance  -- usually a month to six weeks -- so that you will have time to stockpile  enough blood. Usually, you can donate one to two units of blood per week for up  to four to five weeks before surgery. (Blood can be stored for 42 days.)    To allow your body time to replenish its own blood volume for the surgery, you  should not donate blood during the three days prior to the surgery.    * Find out the location for donations: Ask your doctor where to make the  donations -- usually a donor room at your hospital, or a local blood donor  center -- and call and schedule your appointments. Ask the doctor if you should  take iron supplements to help you avoid anemia.

headline:   SCIENCE / MEDICINE;    GETTING A GRIP ON SCHIZOPHRENIA;    PSYCHOLOGY: EACH YEAR ABOUT 100,000 AMERICANS ARE DIAGNOSED AS SCHIZOPHRENIC.  DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD USE OF THE TERM, PSYCHIATRISTS ARE STILL DEBATING ITS  DEFINITION AND WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY A DISEASE OR HAS A BIOLOGICAL BASIS.   
text:   At a conference titled "What Is Schizophrenia?" held here earlier this month,  the first speaker paused at the podium to ask for the next slide, which he said  would show a list of "established facts" about the disorder. Instead, the  screen suddenly went blank, prompting wry laughter to ripple through the  auditorium.    Just what has been "established" about schizophrenia was the subject of serious  and sometimes sharp-edged discussions during this two-day gathering, which took  place nearly 80 years after the term was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen  Bleuler.    Each year about 100,000 Americans are newly diagnosed as schizophrenic, which  means that they are said to believe things that aren't true, to see or hear  things that aren't there, to have disorganized thoughts and speech, to exhibit  various disturbances of emotion and to withdraw from others. Most people we  think of as "crazy" or "demented" are likely to be diagnosed as schizophrenic.    But here at Clark University, where Freud gave a famous lecture in 1909, 16  psychiatrists, psychologists, philosophers and social scientists gathered to  debate whether schizophrenia is actually a disease and whether it has a  biological basis.    Challenging the conventional wisdom in the field, some participants proposed  that the disorder actually does not meet the criteria for a disease. They also  charged their colleagues with giving short shrift to environmental factors that  lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The mavericks in the field of mental  health even questioned whether the word "schizophrenia" is meaningful or  useful.    "What is the 'it' we talk about as schizophrenia?" psychologist Morton Wiener,  a co-host of the conference, asked his colleagues. "We talk about outcome and  we talk about effects, but what's the animal itself?"    The animal may be a unicorn, argued Theodore Sarbin, professor emeritus of  psychology at UC Santa Cruz. "Schizophrenia is a social construction to deal  with people whose conduct is unacceptable to" those in positions of power, he  said. "My recommendation is that we banish the term to the musty historical  archives."    "In the 1930s, I might have believed you," retorted psychiatrist Joseph Zubin,  an influential researcher in the field. "In 1990, what you say is complete  nonsense."    Part of the controversy results from the slipperiness of the diagnosis. In a  paper presented at the start of the conference, Manfred Bleuler, Eugen's son,  observed that two people who are both classified as schizophrenic may have very  different sets of symptoms -- and many of these features may be shared by  people regarded as normal. These are facts, he noted, "which it would be  pleasant to forget."    Psychiatrists who define and refine the diagnostic category of schizophrenia  often have trouble agreeing among themselves about such things as whether a  given delusion (a false belief) qualifies as "bizarre." This was conceded by  Thomas McGlashan, who sits on the committee now preparing the fourth version of  the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual, the practitioner's handbook.    Later, in an interview, he acknowledged that the list of diagnostic criteria  for schizophrenia resembles "a Chinese menu and you see that there's something  arbitrary about it."    Still, Zubin and others insisted that psychiatrists are making progress in  establishing a systematic procedure for understanding and diagnosing the  disorder, which they refer to as a disease. "It's a line of reasoning that will  eventually lead to something, even if the word schizophrenia doesn't last  forever," said Paul McHugh, who heads the department of psychiatry at Johns  Hopkins medical school.    Yet McHugh admitted that "schizophrenia is difficult to describe and define  even as a clinical concept" -- partly because no one knows why people act in  ways that lead to that diagnosis.    Most psychiatrists now believe that some neuro-biological problem is  responsible, but several conference participants warned about relying too  heavily on such theories. "Scientists have been too facile in invoking biology  to explain schizophrenia," argued Robert Carson, a Duke University psychologist  who has written widely on the subject.    The reason, he said, has a lot to do with what kind of research gets funded.  The National Institute of Mental Health, which hands out about 85% of all money  used to study mental disorders, tends to pay for people to look at brains  rather than at families, to emphasize genetic rather than cultural factors.    "Biological psychiatry is very much in the saddle, particularly with respect to  funding," Carson said. "The best way to get money from a politician is to say,  'Give me five more years and we'll lick schizophrenia because it's a genetic  disease.' But we'll never have a miracle cure because schizophrenia is too  involved with the whole life of the person."    Watching schizophrenics whose symptoms come and go, largely in response to what  is happening around them, has led Yale psychiatrist John Strauss to repudiate  "metaphors like 'the broken brain.' " Strauss described how a raving paranoid  schizophrenic used to beat him at chess, proving that he could calm down and  think clearly when the situation called for it.    The story is also told of a psychiatrist who had to examine a catatonic  schizophrenic in order to pass an examination. The patient sat frozen, ignoring  all questions, until the psychiatrist finally got down on the floor with him  and shouted, "Look, I'm going to flunk this exam unless you say something" --  whereupon the patient began to speak.    In short, therapists need to see "the patient as a goal-directed being who's  trying to solve problems" rather than as someone simply "suffering from  happenings in the brain," Sarbin said.    Even critics of mainstream psychiatry tend to agree that genetic predisposition  plays some role in determining who becomes schizophrenic. But the studies of  twins that led to this conclusion have been severely criticized. "They're so  full of errors as to be almost worthless," said Carson, who, along with other  dissident researchers, has identified numerous problems with the best-known  studies.    Carson also pointed out that even genetic researchers concede that nearly 90%  of schizophrenic patients have no close relatives with the disorder.    Most researchers believe that some genetically vulnerable individuals react  badly to stress, which means that both biology and environment contribute to  the appearance of schizophrenia. But some specialists emphasize the role of the  latter, rejecting the view that schizophrenia is simply a brain disease that  "happens" to people -- a view that has found favor among organizations made up  of the families of schizophrenics.    A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last March, for  example, used a new scanning technique to compare the brains of 15 sets of  identical twins, one of whom in each case was schizophrenic. Differences in the  brains were noted in almost every case -- even though identical twins have  identical genes. Clearly, something other than genetic factors must have  produced those differences.    When researchers discover a neurological abnormality in people with behavioral  disorders, it is usually assumed that this feature of the brain is responsible  for the behavior. In fact, though, it may work the other way around. In the  schizophrenia study, it might even be that the anatomical difference resulted  from drugs given to the schizophrenics, Zubin conceded.    Also cited at the conference was a recent Finnish study that followed 271  children of schizophrenic mothers, all of whom were put up for adoption. Of the  children who were placed in families judged as psychologically healthy, not one  became schizophrenic.    Contrary to the impression given in many popular articles on the subject, UCLA  psychologist Michael J. Goldstein concluded in a 1988 review of three major  studies that "variations in the rates of schizophrenia are predictable" not  only from genetics but "in part from prior estimates of disturbances in the  'family' environment."    Moreover, said McGlashan, director of the Chestnut Lodge Research Institute,  "the schizophrenia-as-brain-disease theory is taken to mean that all you have  to do is give them a drug -- you don't have to worry about the patient as a  person."    University of Chicago psychiatrist Laura Miller, who was not at the conference,  agrees that psychotherapy, and not merely medication, "makes sense for some  schizophrenics even when there does appear to be a biological basis." Therapy  can address the psychological purposes that some symptoms serve and can help  patients cope with the day-to-day effects of delusions, impaired communication  and loneliness.    Miller has also uncovered other evidence that suggests the schizophrenic is an  active subject rather than the helpless object of an illness. In an unpublished  study, Miller found that many schizophrenics value their hallucinations, and  that as a result these people "find some way to continue hallucinating" despite  their treatment.    While Carson and others dismissed the idea that a "cure" will ever be found for  schizophrenia -- largely because this reflects a misconceived notion of the  nature of the disorder -- Zubin emphatically rejected the pessimistic idea that  schizophrenics rarely get better.    "It is not a permanently chronic condition leading to deterioration," he said.  In fact, "from 23% to 50% of schizophrenics never relapse after their first  episode."    But some of the sterner critics at the conference pointed out that even to talk  about a "first episode" or about "symptoms" is to assume the existence of an  ongoing disease -- an assumption not proved to everyone's satisfaction.    A clever researcher who chose to attribute madness to supernatural causes could  "prove" that demonic possession runs in families and that its effects were  mitigated by taking certain medications, according to Carson. This no more  demonstrates the value of invoking the devil than similar findings justify  invoking neurobiology.    According to Daniel Miller of Wesleyan University, some theorists see  schizophrenia as a "clear-cut, static entity" with a cause that can be pinned  down -- which reflects 19th-Century scientific thinking. Others see it in terms  of evolving social arrangements and interactions. Which of these two basic  models is preferred ultimately comes down to "a matter of faith," he  maintained.

headline:   IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;    CONTAMINANT BLAMED FOR AILMENT   
text:   A contaminant found in mussels apparently caused an unusual and irreversible  long-term memory loss in 14 people in Canada in late 1987, scientists reported  last week. A toxin called domoic acid produced by a common seaweed appears to  have destroyed brain cells, leaving 13 of the victims permanently disabled.    While no other cases are believed to have occurred, the incident led to changes  in the way mussels are labeled and tested in Canada and prompted an extensive  testing program for domoic acid in Maine, which produces 85% of mussels in the  United States.    Domoic acid apparently creates hyperactivity in brain cells and "makes the  cells almost commit suicide," said Dr. Neil Cashman, a neurologist and  co-author of one of two studies on the mussel contamination published in the  New England Journal of Medicine.    In one study, the toxin caused a variety of symptoms, including vomiting,  abdominal cramps, diarrhea and severe headaches; 25% of those affected suffered  short-term memory losses.    The research could have implications for understanding such devastating brain  disorders as Alzheimer's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease, which some  scientists suspect may involve a toxin, Cashman said.

headline:   AIDS CONFERENCE ENDS ON NOTE OF CONFIDENCE;    HEALTH: BUT PARTICIPANTS ARE REMINDED THAT THE WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC REMAINS OUT  OF CONTROL.   
text:   After five hectic days of activism and science, the Sixth International  Conference on AIDS concluded Sunday with optimism over the prospects for better  treatments and a vaccine but sobering reminders that the worldwide AIDS  epidemic remains out of control.    While promising, preliminary studies of new antiviral drugs and prototype  vaccines grabbed the headlines, many researchers stressed that educating people  to avoid infection with the human immunodeficiency virus still remains the only  way to significantly affect the course of the disease both in the United States  and abroad.    "The epidemics in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia are  not coming under control -- they are expanding," said Dr. Jonathan Mann, the  American physician who many view as the conscience of the global AIDS battle.  "The hard-learned lessons from San Francisco, Amsterdam, Sydney and Nairobi  (where AIDS prevention efforts have been most intensive) are not being  systematically applied."    Dr. James W. Curran of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said the estimated  40,000 to 80,000 new infections a year in the United States indicate that the  epidemic is still growing. "We are nowhere near level yet."    Frustration over the U.S. government's response to the epidemic erupted at the  conference's closing ceremonies. Several hundred AIDS activists drowned out  remarks by Dr. Louis Sullivan, the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services.  Sullivan emphasized the need for tolerance and unity in the fight against AIDS.    But despite the grim global statistics -- an estimated 6 to 8 million people  worldwide already infected with HIV and a cumulative total of 15 to 20 million  infections predicted by the end of the decade -- this was the first  international AIDS conference where the promise of eventual success loomed  large, if only the political, economic and social will can be found to  implement the key research advances.    "The goal for the 1990s should be a lofty one, namely the ability to completely  and indefinitely suppress HIV in infected individuals," said Dr. Anthony S.  Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases. Fauci spoke at Sunday's closing session, during which activists  heckled Sullivan.    "The pandemic's short history also means that the potential to influence its  future course remains high," said Mann, the former director of the World Health  Organization's AIDS program. "There is no country and no population in which  AIDS is a 'lost cause' -- unless it is abandoned."    This new optimism is based not on dramatic breakthroughs -- of which there were  none reported this week -- but on the cumulative effect of reports of promising  experimental drugs and successful AIDS vaccine tests in animals.    Many leading vaccine researchers predicted that large-scale tests of  experimental AIDS vaccines could begin in humans within two to four years and  that tests to determine if vaccines can protect the fetuses of infected  pregnant women could begin next year.    Researchers at UC Davis reported preliminary success in protecting cats against  an immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV. Scientists at the Medical Biology  Institute in La Jolla also described advances in a mouse model for HIV  infection that may prove useful in testing prototype vaccines.    There was general agreement that combinations of anti-HIV drugs now under  development will yield superior results to single drugs. Scientists here also  concurred that, as Dr. Margaret Fischl of the University of Miami said,  "Intervention should occur as early as possible. . . . This will be associated  with the best benefit and delay in progression to AIDS."    HIV gradually destroys the body's immune system, leaving infected individuals  vulnerable to many life-threatening infections and tumors. AIDS, however, can  sometimes be postponed with the antiviral drug AZT or antibiotics to prevent  AIDS-related Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.    Yet years of profound suppression of the immune system seem to take an  inevitable toll. Dr. Robert Yarchoan, a senior investigator at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute, reported that a group of severely immuno-suppressed  AIDS patients on long-term AZT therapy had a 46% risk after three years of  developing "high-grade" non-Hodgkins lymphoma.    This cancer of the lymph node is notoriously difficult to treat in HIV-infected  individuals. Although many AIDS-related pneumonias are being prevented, cases  of non-Hodgkins lymphomas are rapidly increasing across the country.    According to updated results from the San Francisco Department of Public  Health, about half of HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS within 10 years of  becoming infected. About 15%, however, not only have not developed AIDS but  continue to have normal or near-normal immune systems. It is unclear whether  these individuals will eventually develop AIDS.    These findings offer hope that all infected individuals can someday be  maintained with functioning immune systems.    "I don't think anyone is talking about a cure in the sense of getting rid of  every last piece of virus," Yarchoan said. "But there are many viruses that we  have in our body and that we live with and they really don't bother us."    Yarchoan added: "Most adults in this country are infected with Epstein-Barr  virus (which causes mononucleosis) and yet it doesn't do them any harm. The  goal is to convert HIV into a virus like that."    Dozens of new AIDS drugs are in various stages of development, ranging from  compounds similar to AZT, such as DDI, DDC, AzDU and d4T, to various therapies  to boost the immune system, such as Dr. Jonas Salk's HIV-immunogen, to novel  substances that may block the growth of the virus, such as protease inhibitors  and so-called "TIBO derivatives."    If a sufficient number of these drugs maintain their early promise, AIDS  researchers and government officials may need to reset priorities for large  clinical trials so that the combinations of agents most likely to be safe and  effective are tested first. As a result, many highly touted drugs are likely to  fall by the wayside as the more active and less toxic agents are identified.    Fauci cautioned, however, that researchers were "far from reaching our goal  regarding therapy." Drugs such as AZT, DDI and DDC "have considerable toxicity  and are generally only temporarily effective," he said.    But while "early intervention" against AIDS emerged as a new buzz phrase among  American researchers and their Western European counterparts, the high cost of  such therapy illustrated the increasing gap between rich and poor -- both  within nations and between nations -- when it comes to AIDS treatments.    "Early intervention is still a meaningless concept in developing countries; AZT  remains too expensive for most of the people who need it," Mann said. (The  wholesale price for the 500 mg daily dosage regimen recommended for adults with  asymptomatic HIV infections is about $2,200 a year.)    As examples, Mann pointed out that the total budget of the average national  AIDS program in the developing world "is less than the cost of caring for only  15 people with AIDS in the United States." And the industrialized world's total  contribution to AIDS in the developing world is about $200 million a year, or  one-fifth the total annual expenditure on AIDS prevention and care in New York  state alone.    Through intravenous drug use and prostitution, the number of HIV-infected  individuals in Thailand has increased from less than 1,000 in late 1987 to more  than 100,000. In India, heterosexual transmission in cities such as Bombay has  spawned a rapidly growing HIV epidemic that is already larger than the Thai  epidemic.    The profound effect of inadequate resources to fight AIDS is most evident in  sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1987 and 1989, the number of infected individuals  increased from 2.5 million to more than 4 million as the virus spread from  cities to rural areas, according to Dr. James Chin of the World Health  Organization's AIDS program. Hundreds of thousands of children are either  infected or orphaned.    The number of HIV infections in these areas represents at least half of the  global total. In Uganda alone -- a nation of 16.8 million -- an estimated 1  million people are infected, which is about the same number of HIV infections  as in the entire United States .    At the same time, the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa has sparked an equally  alarming epidemic of tuberculosis. One and a half million people there are  estimated to be dually infected with HIV and tuberculosis.    Unlike AIDS, tuberculosis is relatively easy to treat and prevent. HIV  infection is "the most potent activator of dormant tuberculosis ever detected,"  according to Dr. Peter Eriki of the WHO.    "They were unable to contain a relatively small tuberculosis problem before the  arrival of HIV and they are singularly ill prepared for coping with a very  large problem ahead," Eriki said.    It is for such reasons that Mann and current WHO officials urged a global  vision to confront a global problem.    "AIDS has become the crucible in which the future of health is being forged,"  Mann said. "Either we build upon and strengthen and expand what has already  been accomplished, or in the years to come we will fall further and further  behind the pace of the worldwide epidemic."

headline:   COLUMN ONE;    U.S. LOOKS ABROAD FOR ITS HEROES;    AMERICANS OFFER ADULATION TO FOREIGNERS SUCH AS MANDELA, WHO SEEM TO EMBODY THE  HEROIC QUALITIES LACKING IN THE INSTANT CELEBRITIES AT HOME.   
text:   The faces in the crowd are the same: eager and expectant -- that mixture of awe  and hope in the gaze of people who have waited hours for a chance to touch the  hand or hear the words of a hero.    Only the heroes have changed. The objects of Americans' adulation have  developed a distinctly foreign cast.    Over the last few months, Lech Walesa and Mikhail S. Gorbachev have made  triumphal tours across America that no domestic figure seems able to equal.    Now it is Nelson Mandela -- cheered by a million New Yorkers this week,  showered by confetti in a ticker-tape parade on Broadway and saluted at rallies  as he began a tour of America.    Is the American hero now an import?    For most of this century, American heroes have been just that -- American.  Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., John  Glenn -- each excelled in a different sphere. But all were seen as embodying  central aspects of the American character and were placed on the exalted  platform that the nation reserves for its most admired figures.    In recent years, by contrast, America has been marked by a deep cynicism about  its domestic political figures and institutions, said David Riesman, a retired  Harvard social historian. In arenas as varied as sports, politics and  entertainment, idols have turned out to have feet of clay.    At the same time, Americans in the final decade of the 20th Century are  bombarded with celebrity, as Daniel J. Boorstin, formerly the librarian of  Congress, noted in his book, "The Image."    "Celebrity-worship and hero-worship should not be confused," Boorstin wrote.  "Yet we confuse them every day," and "by doing so we come dangerously close to  depriving ourselves of all real models."    Because they are unable to identify real domestic heroes among the mass of  instant celebrities, Americans naturally gravitate to foreigners who seem to  display heroic characteristics such as courage, decisiveness and mastery of  fate.    "There's almost gratefulness to these people for existing," Riesman said. "We  still want to look up to people. We're not as cynical as we sometimes like to  make out we are."    There are no exact measures of the breadth of these new heroes' appeal. Each  has tailored his U.S. visit to cities where his appeal would likely be  greatest, as UC Berkeley political scientist Raymond E. Wolfinger noted.    Thus Polish labor leader Walesa visited Chicago, with its huge Polish-American  community. Soviet President Gorbachev visited Minneapolis and San Francisco,  two of the most liberal cities in the nation. South Africa's Mandela is  visiting a series of cities with large black populations.    The eagerness of national politicians to get close to the visitors, the  attentiveness of the news media, the vast enthusiasm of the crowds and the  results of public opinion polls all indicate that the impact has been real and  considerable.    That impact has been possible because of both a dearth of home-grown heroes and  a shift in how Americans view the nation's position in the world.    The decline of home-grown heroes has many possible causes.    Boorstin argues that the cult of celebrity has drowned out the possibility of  authentic heroes. The whirl of stars, each rising fast and most falling just as  fast, along with the widespread commercialization of popular entertainment,  have changed the way Americans view many aspects of mass culture.    Consider sports, to take one example. Basketball player Michael Jordan is  probably the best-known sports star in the nation. Americans know him both as a  player and as a commercial symbol for such products as Wheaties and Nike. He  earns a huge income, far more than ever dreamed of by Babe Ruth or Joe  DiMaggio. But neither Jordan nor any other athlete of today seems able to  command the broad public affection that was lavished on Ruth and DiMaggio.    Few Frontiers    Those who conquered new frontiers traditionally became American heroes. Daniel  Boone, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson and "Buffalo Bill" Cody went west. Later  heroes crossed the frontiers of air and space: Charles A. Lindbergh with his  solo flight across the Atlantic, Glenn with the first American orbit of the  Earth.    Today, those frontiers seem constrained, said Michael Lofaro of the University  of Kentucky, who has studied heroes in American literature. Heroes are far  harder to develop, he said, in an age when "the great man has been replaced by  the machine."    Political figures have provided another source of heroes in eras past. But,  today, said historian William C. Leuchtenberg of the University of North  Carolina, politics is dominated by "men in gray flannel suits" who simply fail  to excite.    The only recent political figure who approached hero status is former President  Ronald Reagan. In the latter part of his term, however, Reagan lost  considerable standing because of the Iran-Contra scandal.    After leaving office, Reagan appears to have fallen victim to the defect that  has plagued many other would-be American heroes -- commercialization. The  multimillion-dollar fee he received last year for a brief speaking tour in  Japan detracted from his image as a man who transcended the worldly concerns of  ordinary Americans.    The news media's intense concentration on the private lives and scandals of  popular figures may also play a role in knocking down American heroes as fast  as they can rise.    Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado might never have become a heroic figure even  if the press had not reported on his interest in women other than his wife  during his 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. But, as  biographers have since disclosed, earlier political figures, such as President  John F. Kennedy, had similar sexual peccadilloes that were not reported at the  time.    The absence of domestic heroes leaves a void. As Riesman said, heroes are an  essential part of every culture, reassuring the public that something exists  that is larger than life.    Boundaries Fall    America's changing role in the world has made that void easier to fill from  abroad.    Foreign heroes are not entirely new. After a wave of mostly unsuccessful  revolutions swept Europe in 1848, some of the leading insurrectionaries -- the  Lech Walesas of their day -- toured America, the land of democracy and  revolution, seeking support. Lajos Kossuth, the leader of Hungary's failed  attempt to free itself from Austria, attracted 100,000 people, who lined the  railroad tracks from Columbus to Cleveland to cheer him as he toured Ohio,  still a frontier state, in 1852.    A century later, Sir Winston Churchill became one of the most widely admired  men in America for his brave leadership of Britain in the fight against Nazism.    Those events, however, have been exceptions. More often, Americans have been  notable for a feeling that theirs was a country that would find little to learn  and even less to admire in the "Old World."    Indeed, those who were thought to cleave to non-American role models were often  subjects of suspicion. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy was  forced to defend himself against charges that his Roman Catholic faith would  subject him to dictation from a foreign Pope. Jews were often suspected of  possessing a dual loyalty to the United States and Israel that placed their  patriotism under suspicion. During the height of the Cold War, that wariness of  foreigners became entwined with fear of communism to produce a generalized  suspicion of "outside influences" in much of American society.    That resistance appears to have faded, at least among substantial parts of the  American population. An increased amount of travel abroad, widespread  television pictures from overseas and the increased celebration of ethnic  diversity at home have combined to make Americans more open to foreign  concepts, said Berkeley's Wolfinger.    At the same time, said Stanford sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, Americans  once more see the world as being open to them and their values.    Until very recently, Mandela, for example, might have made many Americans  nervous. Although American opinion generally has opposed apartheid for years,  the African National Congress' ties to the South African Communist Party and  its guerrilla tactics made many Americans uneasy.    But now concerns about communism have sharply diminished. Even the leader of  the Soviet Union, which no longer seems poised to launch its nuclear missiles,  can be praised in the United States for pursuing greater freedom and openness  -- what many Americans see as "their values."    Projection of those values onto a public figure is at the heart of how a hero  is created. Throughout history, heroes have been concocted of fact mixed with  large amounts of fantasy and hope. Indeed, one of the major deterrents to the  development of new American heroes may be the relentlessness of the modern  publicity apparatus, which renders nearly everything accessible and leaves  almost nothing mysterious.    By contrast, although satellite television pictures and overseas newspaper  correspondents bring foreign figures unprecedented amounts of public  recognition within the United States, foreign leaders still remain sufficiently  veiled behind a curtain of distance and unfamiliarity that they leave something  to Americans' imagination.    Skepticism Fades    When Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Americans initially viewed him as being  cut from the same cloth as his predecessors, said Jeffrey C. Alexander,  chairman of UCLA's sociology department, who has studied the development of  Gorbachev's public image. Within the first year, however, Americans, and  particularly their news organizations, began to describe Gorbachev as  pragmatic, dynamic, informal, spontaneous and self-confident.    That in turn appears to have influenced American policy. Public confidence in  Gorbachev has tempered domestic pressure on the Bush Administration to take a  tough line with the Soviets over the Lithuanian crisis, for example. White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attracted criticism when he referred to the  Soviet leader last spring as a "drugstore cowboy," and Bush now routinely  praises Gorbachev.    The process has been even more striking in Mandela's case.    "For the broad American public, we didn't know who this man was," said pollster  and political consultant Paul Maslin. In the last few years, Mandela's name  became known to some Americans, particularly blacks, but little was known of  his history. For nearly 28 years, his words and ideas had reached the outside  world only sporadically and through the intermediaries who were allowed rare  visits with him in prison.    Strangest of all in this video age, no one outside of a small circle of  intimates had seen his face.    And then, in pictures watched by hundreds of millions of people around the  globe, Mandela walked out of prison in a scene that almost perfectly  recapitulated essential elements of ancient myths about heroes who dramatically  return from long exile to save their people.    For most Americans, the specifics of Mandela's ideas and the details of his  policies remain obscure and, perhaps, not even relevant. When asked by  reporters why they turned out to see him, people in the crowds commonly used a  phrase that applies more to the United States than to Africa: civil rights.    For many Americans, black and white, Mandela has become "a 1990 version of  Martin Luther King," Maslin said.    That connection could become the key to how the country greets the African  National Congress leader as his tour of the nation continues. Mandela began  entering the American consciousness primarily as a hero for black Americans. He  was part of a long tradition of ethnic heroes -- nationalist leader Eamon de  Valera for Irish-Americans earlier in this century, for example, and the late  Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir for Jews.    More recently, however, Mandela has emerged as a hero with a broader reach. As  an apostle of a future cleansed of racism, Mandela fills a void for many white  Americans who, since King's assassination in 1968, haven't had "a black leader  they can unambivalently admire," said Anne Fabian, who teaches American studies  at Yale University.    "Mandela makes us feel good about ourselves," said UCLA's Alexander. "He's  raising a dream of a multiracial society; that's what we're celebrating.    "We don't know what the person is like, so we're really thinking about our own  society," he said. "These heroes are projections of what we think they are or  what we'd like to become. That's why we create them."

headline:   JUDGE LAUDED FOR POLICY OF LETTING INS SCREEN COURT;    IMMIGRATION: HE ASSISTS IN EVENTUAL DEPORTATION OF DEFENDANTS WHO ARE ILLEGAL  ALIENS. A BILL IN SACRAMENTO WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHER JURISTS TO DO THE SAME.   
text:   Eighteen months after Judge David O. Carter invited federal immigration agents  into his Orange County courtroom to identify illegal aliens convicted of  serious crimes, the experiment is being eyed as a model for California and  other border states.    A proposed law that would encourage all Superior Court judges in California to  follow Carter's lead easily cleared the state Assembly recently. And in  Washington, the leader of a U.S. Justice Department-backed study said he, too,  is optimistic about duplicating the Orange County project in other courts.    "We're very impressed with the program in Orange County," said Joseph A.  Trotter Jr., a lawyer at American University who is conducting the study with a  Justice Department grant. "It has a lot of potential benefit for alleviating  caseload pressures."    Carter is believed to be the only county or state judge in the country who has  invited INS agents to screen people coming through his court -- and his  approach is criticized by some who see it as abusive of detainees or a misuse  of time.    "He's the only judge who feels it's necessary to use state resources for a  federal agency," said Ramon Ortiz, the assistant public defender in charge of  Orange County Superior Court cases. "I find it wrong."    Most of those coming to Carter's court and screened by the INS are felons who  have violated the terms of their probation. A smaller percentage have pleaded  guilty to a new felony offense and are awaiting sentencing before Carter,  although he said he does not know in advance what any offender's residency  status is.    In addition to allowing access to the offenders, Carter's court staff also  promptly provides the INS agents with certified criminal-conviction documents  that are crucial to the deportation process, according to immigration  officials.    Carter's statistics show that illegal aliens make up more than one-third of the  criminal offenders appearing in his court. According to the records, 35% -- 834  of the 2,366 offenders screened in 1989 -- were identified as illegal aliens.  If those violators are not deported upon completing their sentences, local  probation officers already working at full capacity must supervise them.    For Carter, a remedy is at hand: Those illegal-alien offenders -- many of whom  have committed drug offenses, burglary or violent crimes -- should not continue  to burden the probation system.    "I'll be damned if I'm not going to have the resources to turn around a  16-year-old, or an 18-year-old kid" who otherwise might lose the chance to be  rehabilitated while on probation, Carter, 46, said in an interview.    Because of legal restraints and limited federal funds, Carter conceded that it  may be impossible to quickly clear caseloads by deporting criminal aliens  before they are sentenced to already-clogged jails and prisons.    But Carter and INS officials said they are hopeful that, after the illegal  aliens have served their sentences and are formally deported as felons, they  will be less eager to re-enter the United States and risk prosecution that  could result in maximum terms of two to 15 years in federal prison.    John Brechtel, INS assistant district director for investigations, did not have  statistics to document his view, but he said he is convinced "the rate of  recidivism is less" among those deported with a formal, criminal-alien status.    An observation by The Times of Carter's court last week found that INS agents  questioned female and male offenders who would appear later in the morning  before the judge. The questioning occurred through the metal bars of a holding  cell two floors beneath the courtroom in Santa Ana.    Once the agents located an offender they believed was an illegal alien, they  asked questions aimed at providing the best long-term identification aids. One  man, for instance, displayed a hand with a severed middle finger. Another  showed a huge tattoo on his shoulder.    The aliens set to appear before Carter, said one of the INS agents, "are very  cooperative. It's very rare that someone will claim that he's an American  citizen when he's an undocumented alien."    The agents said that the most basic tip-off of whether an individual is in the  United States illegally is whether that person can speak English. After the  questioning is completed and those interviewed appear before Carter, the  judge's staff provides the necessary paper work, usually within 24 hours.    A bill inspired by Carter's project cleared the state Assembly on June 15 by a  61-4 vote. It would specify that judges could, under state law, similarly  cooperate with the INS.    "A lot of (judges) are hesitant to implement it because it is not specifically  allowed for in law," said Lynn Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the bill's author,  Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles).    The measure, AB 3819, is awaiting a hearing in the state Senate and Roos said  he expects it to pass.    The Orange County project also is getting national scrutiny. Trotter, the  lawyer at American University, has enlisted court officials from Texas and Cook  County, Ill., to help examine the project. He said the group will report its  findings to the Justice Department later this summer.    Still, some look skeptically at the project.    Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Horowitz, supervisor of the court's  criminal division, said he thinks it is better for INS agents to confine their  screening to jail facilities. The INS has been granted access to Los Angeles  County jails for about a year, Horowitz said, but not to courtroom holding  cells, as allowed by Carter.    Horowitz said that granting INS agents access to the holding cells "really  interferes" with the confidentiality of conversations between defense lawyers  and detainees in what are already cramped quarters.    Nativo Lopez, spokesman for Hermandad Mexicana Nacional of Santa Ana, an  advocacy group for undocumented workers, said he is "concerned from the  standpoint that individuals are not informed that they have a right to counsel  before they're interrogated by these people."    "It's a specious argument," Carter countered, noting that INS agents routinely  question suspected illegal aliens on the street and elsewhere without attorneys  present. Carter said his project requires the questioning of detainees of all  racial backgrounds and is fair because those being targeted have committed  "aggravated" felonies and may be dangerous.

headline:   CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS;    BACKING OF ABORTION RIGHTS NO GUARANTEE OF VICTORY AT POLLS   
text:   After taking credit for two highly visible electoral wins last fall,  abortion-rights advocates have suffered a string of defeats in legislative  races that appear to show that favoring legal abortion does not automatically  enhance a candidate's chances for success in California.    Anti-abortion activists, in fact, contend that recent election results  demonstrate that candidates who clearly communicate their opposition to  abortion can pick up votes in Republican races and in some sectors of the  Democratic Party.    Supporters of abortion rights acknowledge that the issue is not a "magic  bullet" that by itself can defeat a candidate who has other advantages or elect  a person burdened with other political baggage.    "It's not a miracle issue," said Robin Schneider, director of the Abortion  Rights Action League's Southern California office. "It is very important with a  large number of voters. But it can't just pull a candidate from the loser's  column into the winner's column."    The recent results have done nothing yet to alter the makeup of the  Legislature, where abortion-rights advocates enjoy more clout than they have  for years. State lawmakers are expected to approve a budget for the fiscal year  beginning July 1 that for the first time in a decade will have no restrictions  on the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions for poor women.    But this year's returns have shown that abortion-rights supporters may find it  difficult to routinely duplicate the strength they demonstrated in special  elections last year, when they were able to concentrate their firepower on one  race at a time and focus the voters' attention on abortion. In regular  elections and with politicians running for statewide office, other issues,  including the candidates' gender, have proven to be just as important to voters  as their stand on abortion.    In the June 5 California primary, abortion was a prominent issue in eight  Assembly races. Anti-abortion candidates won seven of those races.    In the Republican race for lieutenant governor, abortion was the only major  issue separating state Sens. Marian Bergeson and John Seymour, two little-known  lawmakers from Orange County.    Bergeson stood firm on her long-held position opposing abortion. Seymour,  however, abandoned his anti-abortion stand and decided to back a woman's right  to abortion and the concept of government funding for the procedure. Bergeson  won with 55.2% of the vote.    This undercurrent was not visible, however, in the Democratic race for  governor, where former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein was perceived as  the stronger defender of abortion rights and easily defeated Atty. Gen. John K.  Van de Kamp, who pledged to support legal abortions even though he personally  opposes the practice.    These skirmishes have set the stage for the November elections, when abortion  rights will be highlighted in the races for lieutenant governor and attorney  general, and a freshman Orange County assemblyman will try to keep his seat  after being targeted for defeat by a national abortion-rights organization.    It has been nearly a year since the U.S. Supreme Court's Webster decision  opened the door for states to regulate abortion. That shift intensified  interest in legislative elections and awakened activists on both sides of the  issue who had seen little need for political activity since the court in 1973  stopped states from regulating abortions.    In California's first special election after the July 3 Webster decision,  Republican Tricia Hunter, a nurse from Bonita and an abortion-rights supporter,  swept past several anti-abortion foes to win the 76th District Assembly seat.  In December, Democrat Lucy Killea of San Diego won a special election in a  Republican-dominated state Senate district after the Catholic bishop of San  Diego banned her from receiving Communion because of her advocacy of abortion  rights.    Nationwide, supporters of legalized abortion heralded the two contests as  evidence that even conservative voters would elect candidates who back abortion  when given a clear choice on the ballot.    But since Killea's victory, the trend has turned.    In a special election to fill the 31st Senate District seat earlier this year,  anti-abortion Republican Frank Hill won that party's nomination over a  well-financed abortion-rights advocate. Hill triumphed even though he was  campaigning under the cloud of an FBI corruption investigation. He later won  the runoff easily to capture the seat.    On June 5, abortion-rights groups targeted two incumbent assemblymen for  defeat: Republican Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach and Democrat Pete Chacon of  San Diego.    Ferguson's opponent was Phyllis Badham, the daughter of a well-known former  congressman. Chacon ran against Celia Ballesteros, a lawyer and former city  councilwoman. Both challengers were able to raise and spend about as much money  as the incumbents.    Although incumbent legislators generally are difficult to defeat, the results  in these two races were just as lopsided as would have been expected had the  abortion issue never been raised. Ferguson and Chacon both won by margins of  more than 20%.    Elsewhere, anti-abortion Assembly members Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and  Dominic Cortese (D-San Jose) won easily against candidates who supported  abortion rights.    Republican Paula Boland, who began the 38th District race in the San Fernando  Valley as the least-known of three major candidates, and the only one to oppose  abortion, was nominated. In the 58th District, Long Beach physician Seymour  Alban ran a well-financed campaign that stressed his support for abortion  rights. But he lost the GOP nomination to Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays, who  opposes abortion.    In the 30th District in the San Joaquin Valley, anti-abortion Republican Gerald  G. Hurt defeated Bob Whalen after a campaign in which the Fresno Bee said the  "only public difference between the two was over the abortion issue."    The only victory for abortion-rights supporters was the renomination of  Assemblywoman Hunter. But Hunter just barely defeated under-financed challenger  Connie Youngkin, a nurse who has spent time in jail for helping the  anti-abortion group Operation Rescue blockade abortion clinics.    Brian Johnston, director of the National Right to Life Committee's Western  region, said the results are evidence that the anti-abortion side has  recaptured the political momentum.    "When a pro-life candidate goes against a pro-abortion candidate and stands  squarely on the issue, the pro-life candidate wins," Johnston said.    Abortion rights advocates, however, point out that other factors played a role  -- the "gender vote," for example. The Los Angeles Times Poll showed, for  instance, that three out of every five Republican women who said they support  keeping abortion legal voted for Bergeson, even though she opposes that  position. The implication is that many women were motivated to vote for  Bergeson simply because she is a woman.    Now both sides are looking toward the fall. Both candidates for governor,  Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and Democrat Feinstein, support abortion  rights. But Feinstein maintains that abortion rights can best be protected by a  woman governor.    There are very distinct differences, however, in the abortion views of the  lieutenant governor and attorney general candidates. Republican Bergeson will  face Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who supports abortion rights. For  attorney general, voters will choose between Republican Dan Lungren, a former  congressman who opposes abortion, and Democrat Arlo Smith, the San Francisco  district attorney who supports abortion rights.    At the legislative level, the race likely to attract the most interest will be  Garden Grove Republican Curt Pringle's attempt to hold his Assembly seat  against Democrat Tom Umberg. The National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL)  has named Pringle one of its "NARAL Nine" -- a group of politicians across the  country targeted for defeat.    "Pringle is critical in our scheme," said Schneider of the California Abortion  Rights Action League. "We know it is important to threaten incumbents. But it's  also important to win against incumbents. If we can do that on the strength of  the (abortion) issue, that ratchets up our political power."

headline:   BRADY BACKS NEIL BUSH: 'CAN'T IMAGINE HE BROKE LAW';    THRIFTS: THE TREASURY SECRETARY NOTES THAT THE PRESIDENT'S SON WAS A DIRECTOR,  BUT NOT AN OFFICER, OF A FAILED SAVINGS AND LOAN IN COLORADO.   
text:   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady Sunday defended Neil Bush, the President's  son who is under fire for his actions as a savings and loan director. "I can't  imagine that he broke the law," Brady said.    Brady, in a television interview, noted that Bush was only a director of the  failed Silverado Banking Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Colorado and that "there  are thousands of directors all over this world who sit on boards and (their)  management go ahead and do things."    It was disclosed last Tuesday that the enforcement staff of the federal Office  of Thrift Supervision had charged that Neil Bush had engaged in "personal  dishonesty" while on the board of Silverado, one of the biggest failures among  hundreds of S&amp;L insolvencies.    An OTS staff memo said that Bush had "willfully breached" his duty as a  director by failing to inform his fellow board members that a major borrower at  the S&amp;L, Kenneth M. Good, was going to pay $3 million for an 80% interest  in Bush's oil exploration company.    Appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley," Brady, a close friend of  the President, said he knew the younger Bush and could not believe the  allegations. "I cannot imagine that he willfully did anything wrong," he said.  ". . . I just don't see this as anything more than an issue that's aimed at the  President's son."    Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, meanwhile, declined to disclose whether Bush is  under investigation by his department, saying: "I can't discuss any pending  investigations."    But Thornburgh, appearing on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," brushed aside the  question of whether the Justice Department should stand aside to permit an  independent counsel to look at the matter. "We go where the evidence leads,"  Thornburgh said. "And I don't mean to suggest that any particular individual is  the subject of investigation, but wherever there's evidence of wrongdoing,  we'll pursue it."    Brady, asked whether Neil Bush would be investigated as strongly as anyone else  against whom allegations had been leveled, said: "I would think so. When they  fault him, one individual, up before the House Banking Committee -- there are a  lot of people who were directors. This man wasn't even in the savings and loan  business.    "He was a director. If every director of a savings and loan and bank was  brought before Congress for something that bank did, we wouldn't have time to  do anything else," Brady said.    Bush has strongly denied any wrongdoing in connection with his 1985-1988 tenure  as a Silverado director. He is challenging in an administrative proceeding the  government's allegations that he violated thrift rules.    The OTS staff found that at about the same time that Good was buying control of  Bush's firm, JNB, the board of Silverado agreed to forgive $11 million in loans  and obligations to the institution that Good said he could not repay.    Bush abstained from voting on Silverado's loans to Good, but the OTS document  said he did not disclose his business relations with Good as required by  federal regulations affecting thrift directors.    Good and another investor in Bush's firm, William L. Walters, ultimately  defaulted on more than $130 million in loans at Denver-based Silverado. The  cleanup of the institution, which was seized by federal regulators last  December, could cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion.    In May, Bush told the House Banking Committee that Good had loaned him $100,000  "that was never meant to be repaid" if a speculative commodities scheme in  which it was invested failed to show profits. Good invested the money for Bush  in 1984, a year before Bush joined the Silverado board.    The investment later went sour, and Good formally canceled the loan in January.    "It sounds a little fishy," Bush told the House panel in attempting to explain  why he never mentioned the loan on a conflict-of-interest form required of  directors.    Bush told the House committee that he never had any conflicts of interest while  serving on Silverado's board, as regulators have charged in an administrative  complaint.    He described the complaints as "frivolous. The fact they're being pursued is  baffling to me."

headline:   ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS   
text:   It's beginning to look a lot like . . . Westwood.    Twinkle lights will henceforth glow year-round in Westwood Village, and the old  lamplighter is Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky himself.    The lights, until now entwined seasonally throughout the village's trees and  bushes, will be permanently on display -- except for June, when they get  disentangled to accommodate tree trimming.    Yaroslavsky promises the illuminations will "add a special touch," and enhance  what he, with rather foot-in-mouth word choice, termed Westwood Village's  "pedestrian ambiance."    He wuz robbed, he sez.    A second helping of Zev:    A few days after less-than-celebrity candidate Joe Shea filed papers to run for  mayor of Los Angeles, and let the press know that his platform calls for 4,000  new police officers. Councilman Yaroslavsky, who is no longer running for  mayor, has proposed adding 2,100 officers to the force, with the money coming  from the same source -- the Community Redevelopment Agency -- that Shay  declares that he proposed.    It's no coincidence, says the disgruntled Shay.    "I think a lot of candidates treat ideas like water -- it's everybody's  property. That's not the case . . . it was my idea . . . we need thousands of  new policemen. It's simply unfair of (Yaroslavsky) to appropriate this idea and  make political hay out of it when just weeks ago his own platform never  mentioned it."    As George Bush never said: "Read . . . my . . . mind."    Alan B. Ungar will swap you, even-steven, 30-30.    On the third Thursday of every month, the Woodland Hills certified financial  planner offers 30 minutes of financial advice to people facing layoff, divorce,  illness or just rotten luck -- in exchange for a fee of "thirtysomething,"  meaning thirty-anything.    So far, Ungar has collected donations of 30 apples, 30 rolls of toilet paper  and 30 minutes of free hypnotherapy -- but not 30 pieces of silver.    Any cash Ungar collects during the sessions is handed over to the anti-war  group Beyond War, and the in-kind 30s, from fruit to lav paper, is sent to a  shelter for battered women and abused children.    And that, as we say in the newspaper biz, is 30 for that story.    Go figure it.    Wednesday was the 66th annual meeting of the Hospital Council of Southern  California, a group of good-health professionals getting together in the land  of the fit.

headline:   AL MARTINEZ: TAKING CARE OF CRIME   
text:   The Long Beach Police Department is under fire these days as the result of a  videotaped incident in which an officer cursed at and appeared to shove a man's  face through a plate glass window for being black, wearing dirty clothes and  occupying a 12-year-old car. The matter is under investigation by everyone but  the Presbyterian Church and I'm certain that eventually we will learn that the  officer violated basic police procedure. You never curse a suspect while  shoving his face into a plate glass window.    We all know by now that the victim of the face-shoving incident was Don  Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from another police department who  was trying to show that police abuse of minorities is rampant in Long Beach, a  premise he managed to illustrate with some degree of personal sacrifice. I  mean, plate glass windows aren't exactly plastic wrap. You've got to use a  little muscle to shove a head through one.    With Jackson that night was Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer,  who was driving the car. Both men wore dirty clothes, which in itself is  considered a misdemeanor in Long Beach. They were tooling along Pacific Coast  Highway at a moderate rate of speed when they were pulled over by a patrol car  containing Officers Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey.    The entire incident was secretly videotaped by an NBC television crew as part  of an activist group's sting operation looking for examples of police  brutality. The officers insisted later that they had stopped the car not  because the men were black and wore dirty clothes but because the car was  straddling lanes, a claim the television camera proved to be questionable, at  best. What happened thereafter was the cursing and the face-shoving by Officer  Dickey, which was subsequentely aired nationwide by NBC.    This has created an outcry by bleeding hearts who feel the incident  demonstrates the basest kind of police racism, but I buy the theory promulgated  by Dickey's attorney, Michael Hannon, that at worst his client is guilty of  discourtesy for cursing Jackson, an offense that deserves nothing more serious  than a good finger-shaking and a stern naughty.    The attorney and others argue that Jackson set the whole thing up, deliberately  goading Dickey into taking the action he took. In the first place, they say,  Jackson suspiciously got out of his car when it was stopped (in cop idiom he  exited the vehicle), then demanded to know why the officer had stopped him in  the first place.    I hadn't realized until now that either getting out of a car or asking why you  were stopped constituted acts of aggression requiring a response just short of  deadly force. I was pulled over recently by a California Highway Patrol officer  who claimed I was straddling lanes on the Santa Monica Freeway. When he stopped  me, I exited my vehicle instantly because I've been told you have to move fast  in order to talk a cop out of a ticket. Once he begins writing the citation  it's too late.    Fortunately for me, I'm not black, I don't drive an old car and I dress in a  manner which, while not fashionable, isn't considered shabby. I even made the  mistake of asking the patrolman why he had stopped me which, in Long Beach,  gets your face shoved into a plate glass window. Fortunately, this was on a  freeway and he would have had to drive me to the Santa Monica Mall in order to  reach the nearest plate glass window. As it turned out, he let me go with a  warning not to straddle lanes and never again to wear a polka-dot tie with a  plaid jacket.    Officer Dickey should, of course, be reprimanded for his abusive language and  the Long Beach police manual ought to be revised to disallow shoving anyone's  face into a plate glass window for simple traffic violations, except in cases  where the suspect exits the vehicle and asks why he is being stopped, searched  and cursed.    The rest of us can do our part when in Long Beach by not being black if  possible and, if not possible, by being neat and not sassing the officers and,  above all, not exiting your vehicle unless dragged out by the throat. A lot of  plate glass windows will be saved that way.    If nothing else, I hope the incident points up the tensions that exist between  minority groups and police and in the end creates a means by which the tensions  can be eased. Then we can get on to the serious business of a television series  based on a white cop from one department who abuses a black cop from another  department and in the end they turn out to be best friends who spend their  lives fighting crimes committed by Mexicans, ole.

headline:   MY BEAT : COLOR HIS SUPER BOWL EMPTY, HIS FACE BLUSH-RED   
text:   The vacant parking place should have tipped me off.    After all, I'd always heard there were was no such thing in San Francisco. But  my flight had been delayed and I was late for my assignment, so I gratefully  pulled into the spot in my rental car.    It was seven years ago this week, and I was in the Bay City to write a colorful  piece on the wacky inhabitants of a typical sports bar glorying in the 49ers'  first Super Bowl. Then, as this Sunday, Cincinnati was the opponent.    Knowing nothing of the city, I had phoned the San Francisco Examiner beforehand  and the sports department had cheerfully recommended the name of a "great  joint."    Despite the available parking, I walked in expecting to see Super Bowl banners  and noise-makers, giant television screens and wall-to-wall enthusiasts  uttering quotable things and performing crazy stunts.    Instead, as I stumbled into the darkened interior, I was able to make out the  shapes of six motionless, somewhat disheveled figures huddled over the bar,  including one man who was crying as the National Anthem played on an aged  television set. His friend assured the bartender, "Oh, don't mind him. He cried  all the way through the Jerry Lewis telethon."    I was taken aback but, with my uncanny affinity for getting people to open up,  I decided to get a quote out of the bartender. "So . . . the Super Bowl," I  said.    He glared at me and my blue sports coat. "You want a drink?" he asked.    I ordered a beer. He brought me a can, sans glass.    The game began and I waited, hoping that for some unaccountable reason a horde  of Super Bowl enthusiasts would suddenly storm through the door. Instead,  another of my seatmates fell asleep.    I was 35 years old, a veteran of 14 years in the business and I'd been  hoodwinked by a rival newspaper, tricked into watching the Super Bowl at a Skid  Row bar. That no one would care if I also began weeping was of small  consolation.    I was unwittingly continuing a mostly vanished tradition dating back to the  days when every big city was inhabited by several newspapers, which put out new  editions every few hours and employed reporters under orders to use any trick  to one-up a competitor.    I'd heard of some of the ploys myself.    There was the young newsman on the old Los Angeles Herald in the 1930s who had  arranged with a supposed friend at the rival Express to see the Express' paper  as it came off the press. The Herald man planned to phone the headlines back to  his boss. Only an Express photographer suddenly appeared. A photo of the Herald  reporter ran on the front page of the Express the next day alongside the  headline: "How the Herald Gets Its News."    There was the Examiner reporter in the 1950s who outraced The Times'  representative to a farmhouse -- and the only telephone for miles -- with a  story on a widely publicized murder case. The Examiner man called in his piece,  then paid $50 to the owner of the farmhouse for the privilege of ripping the  phone out of the wall. Stepping outside, where The Times man was politely  waiting, the Examiner man smiled and said, "Here's the phone," and handed it  over.    And in the 1960s, there was the reporter on a small daily who made a habit of  perusing the unoccupied desks of his rivals in a downtown bureau, occasionally  copying down stories they had written -- until the day he stole one about a new  meat plant in his hometown. Unknown to him, his colleagues had concocted the  story and christened the fictitious plant, as well as the plant's officials,  with names that translated as "horse" in various foreign languages.    Now, I could add myself to the list -- the Skid Row humor man, victimized by my  own lazy research.    I wasn't sure The Times' sports editor had an appreciation of such journalistic  traditions. So, at the end of the first quarter, I bid adieu to the bartender  (who didn't look up). For the next hour, I slogged through innumerable  construction and cable car zones before spotting a lively fern bar with a Super  Bowl sign in front.    This time, of course, there was no vacant parking place in sight.    My eventual article, such as it was, gave the appearance that the enthusiasts  in the bar had been strangely tight-mouthed until the second half, when they  suddenly burst forth with boisterous comments.    And, now, San Francisco and Cincinnati have a Super Bowl rematch Sunday.    Obviously the possessor of a good memory, the sports editor is giving me the  day off.    Still, I know that when the National Anthem starts, I'll feel a slight chill.

headline:   BRITISH ELECTIONS   
text:   Having fought and won, with ever increasing majorities, 10 parliamentary  elections in Britain, may I intrude into the debate in your letters column  between Matthew Shugart (Jan. 1) and Tony Oakes (Jan. 9)?    Mr. Oakes is evidently a supporter of the fragmented Social Liberal Democrat  alliance that the British electorate has rejected every time it has had the  opportunity to do so. Your readers should not take too seriously his moans  about "pendulum politics" and the "divide between north and south." Britain,  like America, has its problems but the vast majority of British people, in all  parts of the island, today earn more, keep more, and invest more than at any  time in their history; while their government, especially the prime minister,  enjoys more international respect than at any time since the Second World War.    Mr. Shugart makes more sense than Mr. Oakes. He recognizes that under  proportional representation a candidate's chance of getting elected depends  hardly at all on his or her appeal to his constituents but largely on how high  up his name appears on a "list," drawn up by his party, usually behind closed  doors. And the result, as I can testify from having seen proportional  representation at work in parliaments all over Europe, is that minorities all  too often impose their wishes on the majority -- damaging, not strengthening,  democracy.    For years, I served as a member of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.  Weekends, I had to fly back to England to attend to my constituency duties. Not  so the members from proportional representation countries. They took their ease  in Strasbourg because proportional representation made them far less dependent  on keeping the folks back home happy about what they were doing.    The other advantage of "first past the post" voting is that it helps to elect  strong governments. A clear swing among the voters is translated into an even  stronger swing in the legislature, so that the party winning power, more often  than not, can get its legislation passed.    Winston Churchill, as always got it right. "Ours" he said, "is the worst system  of election there is -- except for all the others."    SIR ELDON GRIFFITHS    House of Commons    London

headline:   OIL GLUT AND OIL CRISIS   
text:   Times staff writer Donald Woutat's recent articles on the current world oil  glut and the future oil crisis were excellent (Part I, Dec. 25-27). They  accurately describe the turmoil in the oil and gas industry as well as the  problems that consumers will face in years to come.    The major integrated companies are taking advantage of low crude oil prices to  maximize their downstream refining and marketing profits. Although average oil  prices in 1988 were lower than they were in 1986 following the collapse of  world oil prices, average gasoline prices were higher. This helps explain the  record profits being posted by the larger companies!    In sharp contrast, the thousands of independent producers who produce one-third  of the United State's domestic oil and gas are struggling to survive. This is  especially critical in California where a typical heavy oil crude sells for  only $9 per barrel, below the average $9.50 per barrel it takes to produce it!    The severe depression in oil patch foretells of continued steep declines in  U.S. production, increased imports from unstable areas of the world, and the  future world oil crisis.    The petroleum industry, the state and federal governments, and energy-thirsty  consumers need to take a critical look at where we are headed. Cyclical low and  high energy prices will continue to send shock waves through our economy until  a responsible long-range national energy policy is adopted. From our  perspective, what is needed most are more stabilized oil prices that will  restore the balance of profit centers for the entire oil and gas industry. The  consumer should not be affected since as the end user he determines the true  fair market price.    JAMES C. (CHRIS) HALL    President    Calif. Independent Petroleum Assn.    Fountain Valley

headline:   OUTRAGE IN STOCKTON   
text:   The appalling crime that transformed a Stockton elementary-school playground  into a slaughterhouse on Tuesday evokes horror at its purposelessness, grief  for its young victims, outrage over how easily a killer came by the weapon that  he would use to murder five children and wound 30 others. Last Aug. 3 Patrick  Edward Purdy, who had a criminal record, walked into an Oregon gun shop, signed  a paper saying that he was neither a felon nor "mentally defective," handed  over some money and became the owner of a Chinese-made AK-47 semi-automatic  rifle -- a weapon whose sole purpose is to kill people. Thus armed, Purdy was  ready when prompted by God knows what compulsion to carry out his massacre of  the innocents.    This cannot be said too forcefully or too often, for it is a terrible truth:  The crime that Purdy committed before ending his own life began the day he  legally purchased the AK-47. The unindictable accomplices to that crime are all  those who have resisted and sabotaged every effort to impose even the most  minimum restraints on gun ownership. The National Rifle Assn. is the leading  lobbying force opposing controls over virtually any kind of gun -- even those,  like the AK-47, that no decent sportsman would think of using. The NRA doesn't  write the nation's laws. It does, however, work long and hard and successfully  to intimidate the nation's lawmakers. On no other issue of public concern have  politicians at both the state and the federal levels proved more gutless, more  weaselly, more ready to do the bidding of a coercive pressure group than on gun  control.    Purdy entered the grounds of Cleveland Elementary School armed with 190 rounds  of ammunition for his high-powered rifle. He could just as easily have been  carrying 1,000 rounds, and his victims could just as easily have numbered in  the hundreds. Will this latest tragedy at long last be enough to arouse  Congress from its fearful inertia and, against the earlier expressed opposition  of President-elect George Bush, lead it to ban such high-tech weapons and pass  a law requiring a police check on all would-be gun purchasers so that felons,  drug abusers and the mentally ill can be screened out? In Stockton, five died.  How many more must die before responsibility and sanity finally prevail in  Congress?

headline:   INCIDENT OR PATTERN?   
text:   If the altercation last Saturday night between two black activists and two  white Long Beach police officers had run true to form, it would have attracted  little attention and would have produced what the experts call a "swearing  match." The cops, under oath, would have sworn that they pulled over the  activists' car because it was weaving down Pacific Coast Highway and that one  of the men threatened them and, while they were restraining him, smashed the  plate-glass window of a hardware store with his elbow. The activists would have  sworn that they had broken no traffic law and that, once pulled over, they were  subjected to a torrent of profanity and excessive physical force that ended  with the arresting officer's pushing one of them through the plate-glass  window. More likely than not, a trial court would have accepted the police  version.    What changed this scenario, of course, was the videotape that NBC made of the  whole incident with a hidden camera and a microphone. The edited tape, played  and replayed in the last few days, strongly suggests that the version of events  related by activists Don Jackson and Jeff Hill, both off-duty law-enforcement  officers themselves, is closer to the truth than what the Long Beach policemen  told their superiors in their formal report. The car was not weaving down the  highway; the expletives came not from Jackson, who was booked for -- among  other things -- suspicion of using offensive language, but from Officer Mark  Dickey; it was Dickey who shoved Jackson's head and arm through the window,  then lied about it.    Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from the Hawthorne Police  Department, has been criticized in some quarters for setting up this sting and  for purposefully provoking an overreaction from the arresting officers by  getting out of the car. Perhaps he was sassier than most citizens would  consider prudent. But, whether or not the current investigations find that he  was provocative, Jackson should be credited with turning the spotlight on a  longstanding unresolved dispute that embroils many cities: Do predominantly  white police departments routinely detain blacks without cause, harass them and  use excessive force?    Jackson and Hill, leaders of the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, an  organization dedicated to exposing racial discrimination in law-enforcement  agencies, insist that the videotape proves their point. The roust on Pacific  Coast Highway was "consistent with a pattern of abuse and excessive force" by  the Long Beach force, says Jackson, citing dozens of citizen complaints from  Long Beach blacks.    Maybe he is right; certainly many blacks share his perception, sometimes  reinforced by personal experience, of racism among the police. But the  videotape doesn't tell the whole tale. It doesn't explain why the Long Beach  officers stopped that car last Saturday night, it doesn't prove whether Officer  Dickey genuinely felt menaced by Jackson, it doesn't determine whether there  was "lawful necessity" for the force that Dickey used, and it emphatically does  not establish a pattern of racism in Long Beach or anywhere else.    Those are all issues, particularly the question of whether it was an isolated  incident or part of a pattern, that should be investigated by the Los Angeles  district attorney's office and the FBI. We would urge that all parties  cooperate with these inquiries -- including NBC, which so far has balked at  releasing a full, unedited videotape. That is the only way, as Long Beach Mayor  Ernie Kell said so forcefully Tuesday, "to find out what happened here and make  sure it never happens again."

headline:   PEOPLE: 2 SOUTHMARK EXECUTIVES QUIT IN DISPUTE   
text:   Southmark Corp.'s two top officers have resigned, breaking a weeklong deadlock  on the troubled Dallas real estate concern's four-member board.    Southmark said Gene Phillips, chairman, president and chief executive, and  William Friedman, vice chairman and secretary, had resigned as officers and  directors. Arthur Weiss, former assistant to the chairman, will replace  Phillips.    Southmark said the resignations end a deadlock on the board without protracted  litigation at a time the company needs to resolve a severe cash squeeze.    "Much has been made in the press of transactions among Southmark and its  executives and related companies. I want to assure our investors that the  company's management and its board of directors are dedicated to operating the  company for the primary benefit of its security holders, to respecting the  integrity of Southmark's public subsidiaries, and to scrupulous compliance with  regulatory requirements," Weiss said.    The board hit an impasse last week when two outside directors refused to  automatically renew $10 million in loans that the two officers had borrowed to  cover margin calls after the October, 1987, stock market crash.    Shares in Dallas-based Southmark, which have slumped in the past year, closed  up 12.5 cents at $2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

headline:   COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: COMPUTERS HAVE SPIN DOCTORS, TOO   
text:   Judging by my mail, many people are concerned about the reliability of the hard  disk drives in their IBM and compatible personal computers.    There's a good reason: Hard disks are wonderful when they work and disastrous  when they fail.    A hard disk drive, also known as a fixed disk drive, is a device installed  inside a computer that stores application programs and data files. Using one or  more magnetic-coated platters spinning at high speed, it stores information the  same way removable floppy disks do.    But hard disks have much greater storage capacity than floppy disks. The  computer can also get at programs and data stored on a hard disk much faster  than if they are on a floppy disk, which boosts overall computer performance.    Over time, portions of a hard disk can go bad, causing data to be lost. If  there is a failure in the critical area known as the file allocation table,  which maps where all your data is stored, you can lose everything on the disk.  In other words, you have what's called a hard disk crash. If you don't have  backup copies of your programs and files on floppies or tape, they are gone.    Fortunately, an arsenal of software is now available that should help ease  computer users' concerns. The three programs described here help prevent  calamities by testing hard disks for signs of weakness and making repairs.      Maintains History of Problems    A process called "low-level reformatting" is used to strengthen the disk  magnetism to make storage more reliable. Portions that can't be fixed are  marked so that nothing will be stored there and existing data at such locations  is moved elsewhere. All three programs also can change the "interleave factor,"  which controls the order in which data is stored on the disk. That maneuver can  make the computer faster if the old interleave factor was not proper.    Disk Technician Advanced ($190) from Prime Solutions Inc. of San Diego  maintains a history of problems it finds each time it tests the hard disk. It  uses that information to predict impending failures before they happen. Weak  areas are reformatted. The program also blocks off bad areas and moves the data  stored there to better locations on the hard disk.    Optune from Gazelle Systems of Provo, Utah, ($100) combines programs that test  disk integrity and reformat and change disk interleaving. It also has a feature  that pulls together disk files when they become fragmented, which improves  computer performance.    The least expensive of the three programs is SpinRite, to which I devoted a  full review last July. At $59 from Gibson Research Corp. of Laguna Niguel, it  offers disk testing and disk reformatting to improve performance.    Disk Technician Advanced is meant to be run every day so that it can keep track  of how well your hard disk is behaving. It detects various degrees of problems  and when they threaten to become serious; it moves data safely out of harm's  way and prevents the computer from using the problem section.    The program runs three types of tests, automatically determining which is  appropriate. On a 20-megabyte hard disk, the daily test takes about three  minutes, the weekly test ranges from about 30 minutes to an hour and the  monthly test can go up to about three hours. The program's speed will vary with  the speed of your computer and hard disk. You'll probably want to do the weekly  test while you're at lunch and let the monthly test run overnight.    Depending on the seriousness of the problems, the program would do one of two  things: It could reformat the problem portion of the disk and then monitor the  area in subsequent tests, or the program could move the data elsewhere and mark  the sector as a bad one so that no more data is placed there. For instance, on  my 70-megabyte hard disk, the program currently is monitoring about 70,000  bytes of data that it suspects are stored on weak sections of the drive.    Disk Technician Advanced has the ability to reformat the entire disk and also  change the interleave factor. But it is more reluctant to reformat than the  other two. The instruction manual, in fact, recommends that such reformatting  be done only on PC/AT and 386 class computers, not on the less powerful PC/XT  or compatibles.    SpinRite and Optune recommend low-level reformatting periodically to strengthen  the magnetic signals of the disk. (SpinRite recommends reformat ting every  three months, and Optune recommends yearly intervals.)    I cannot say that Disk Technician Advanced has saved a disk drive that could  not be saved by Optune or SpinRite. I can say that I used all three programs to  attempt to recover data from a crashed hard disk in a PC/XT on which none of  the programs previously had been used. Neither SpinRite nor Optune could even  detect the drive's presence in the computer. Disk Technician Advanced at least  found the drive and spent about half an hour grinding through it trying to find  usable data before it gave up and reported the crash to be fatal.    Disk Technician Advanced runs more automatically than the other two programs.  For instance, the user does not have to tell it how many hard disk drives are  installed in the computer.    Another nice feature is a small accessory program you can install that moves  the recording heads of the drive to a safe location whenever the drive hasn't  been used for about seven seconds. (Word processing and spreadsheet programs  leave the drive idle for long periods while you type words and numbers.) The  benefit is that if you have a sudden power failure, the recording head won't  fall onto data stored on the disk and ruin it.    Optune focuses on keeping files intact to improve computer performance. The  more files are used, the more fragmented they become when stored on the disk  because there may not be room to store them contiguously.    Optune rewrites the files so that all are stored contiguously. Even if you use  Disk Technician or SpinRite, your machine will benefit from using Optune's  "optimization" routine. It takes only a minute or two for a 20-megabyte drive  if done frequently.    The program also can test disk drive integrity with any one of four methods.  The least rigorous takes two to four minutes, and the most thorough lasts three  to six hours. The manual recommends some level of testing at least once a  month. If weak areas are found, they are marked so that data will not be placed  there.    Optune has the most attractive screen appearance and the best instruction  manual of the three.    SpinRite's manual is the most technical and has the most cumbersome setup  procedure. Casual computer users are likely to be intimidated.    It claims to have the most rigorous disk-testing procedures and it certainly  hurls a lot of technical data at the user as testing progresses. It does not  have file optimization or a database to track the history of disk performance.    I know of several instances when SpinRite has restored failure-prone hard  drives to proper operation. I also believe that Disk Technician Advanced or  Optune would have done the same.    All three programs are based on the likelihood that sooner or later your hard  disk will fail without the preventive maintenance these products provide. You  could gamble that the premise is wrong. But keep your backups current just in  case.    Computer File welcomes readers' comments but regrets that the author cannot  respond individually to letters.

headline:   JACK SMITH: PART TRANS AND ANOTHER PART HUMAN   
text:   I stand uneasily astride the past and the Brave New World envisioned by the  futurist who has changed his name from F. M. Esfandiary to FM-2030.    Evidently FM-2030 adopted his new name to be more in keeping with the digital  society we live in.    (Our recent story about FM-2030, by Connie Koenenn, didn't say whether he is  married or not, but if he is, I wonder how his wife likes being known as Mrs.  F.M-2030. I suppose it's not much worse than being known as Mrs. Smith.)    It is Mrs. Smith who has been trying to drag me or push me into the the Age of  Transhumans, which FM-2030 describes as "a 21st Century era of new evolutionary  being."    Transhumans, Koenenn suggests, are those who take readily to such technological  innovations as personal computers, mobile cellular telephones, electronic mail  and telebanking.    "We live in an electronic environment," FM-2030 says, "a fast-response  environment. If you don't avail yourself of the technology, you will find you  are outdated."    Obviously my wife is worried that I will become outdated. First she urged me to  buy a computer, then she bought a modem for it, then she bought me a compact  disc player, and now she has bought me a fax machine.    I resisted all the way. Now, several years into its use, I admit that the  computer was a good idea. It is so much easier to write on than a typewriter.  The modem was a blessing, though I didn't even hook it up until six months  after she gave it to me. The modem makes it possible for me to send my copy  directly into The Times computer over my telephone, thus making it unnecessary  for me (or my wife) to drive it into The Times every day.    To that degree, I am a Transhuman.    At this point, though, I consider the fax machine an extravagance and a  disaster. She gave it to me for Christmas. I was dumbfounded. "What will I ever  use it for?" I protested.    She said I could have The Times library send clippings to me. I pointed out  that my own library, plus the daily newspaper, and all the other publications  we receive, give me more information than I need. And anything else I can get  over the telephone.    I saw a fax ad in the paper and was dismayed at the price. She said, "You paid  that much for a dress for me."    "Yes," I admitted, "but you've already worn that dress more times than I'm ever  going to use a fax machine. I don't need a fax machine."    She said I was being ungracious.    I don't like being ungracious, so I asked our older son, who was an Air Force  radio technician during the Vietnam War, to install it for me. He came over the  other night and worked for about two hours on it. He said he had connected it  to our second telephone line, which is used mainly by people calling the wrong  number.    The next morning he phoned to say he was going to send me something over his  fax machine, to see if mine worked. While we were talking a female voice cut  in, saying the phone company was unable to complete my call. I found out that  we were talking over both lines at once. I hung up and tried to call him back.  I couldn't get a dial tone. He called back. The red light by the hold button  went on. I found that I could talk to him only on the hold line. Both the other  lines were inoperative.    "I must have done something to the phone," he admitted.    As I write this the phone is still inoperative and I have yet to send or  receive anything on the fax machine.    I have also never used an automatic teller or a telephone credit card. I used  to use the CD with earphones when I was working out on the rowing machine, but  I've dropped both.    So here I stand, with one foot in the Age of Transhumans and one foot out.    I just pray that my wife doesn't buy me a cellular telephone. l don't need a  cellular telephone that doesn't work. I've already got a telephone that doesn't  work.

headline:   ERMA BOMBECK: SHE'S PERFECTLY SUITED TO THIS SPORT   
text:   Erma Bombeck is taking a one-week vacation. This Best of Bombeck was originally  published in 1984.      All my life I have been looking for a sport that features a cute outfit that I  can wear to do my grocery shopping, requires no more effort than putting one  foot in front of the other, allows me to keep my next meal strapped to my back,  and offers the cheap thrill of having someone breathe heavily behind me.    I've found it! Cross-country skiing.    Imagine. No ambulance parked at the bottom of the hill. No tents at the finish  line offering blankets and intravenous feeding. No standing around trying to  find your pulse to see if it is accelerated.    I know there is a lot of curiosity about cross-country skiing, so I will try  not to get technical.    As with any sport, basically what we are talking about is coordination. I  cannot tell you how important it is to coordinate your entire outfit at one  time. The knickers should fit well and be something eye-catching, preferably  matching one's lightweight jacket. A cotton turtleneck or scarf tucked smartly  under a blouse is a nice touch. Socks should be dark to help keep the calves  from looking like piano legs. A lot of people wear thermal underwear, but  personally I find it too warm for the supermarket.    What I really love about the sport is that you don't have to wear those awful  caps that flatten your hair and make it look like an unmade bed. I prefer  earmuffs.    Another tip is to avoid needless exertion. That is why I fry my chicken the  night before and pack the knapsack with small bread-and-butter sandwiches,  thermoses of hot soup and hot chocolate, candy bars and, of course, a  corkscrew.    Setting your pace as you go is very important in cross-country skiing. If you  tear off in a kick-glide movement the way you are supposed to, you will never  meet anybody.    As with most sports, cross-country skiing improves with time and practice.  After a while, you learn that if you look too frightened to move, someone will  clamp your skis on for you, pull your gloved hands through your poles and never  leave your side.    As for the promise of great personal satisfaction, I wouldn't know. Maybe I  will discover that next week when I venture out of the parking lot.

The studio head slapped himself on the thigh with a riding crop.    "Ron has come to Washington to root out waste and corruption in government,  something the people there don't understand. But his strong leadership prevails  and before he is finished, half of his own staff has either been fired or  indicted."    "That is a good start."    "In the meantime, I'm going to have Nancy turning up at all of Ronnie's  meetings, in different outfits, yelling at everyone she meets, 'Just say no.' "    "But where does that lead?" I asked.    "As the story unfolds, the plot poses the question, 'Can a nice guy spend eight  years in the White House without becoming disenchanted with the government?' "    "Does Ron have a crisis of confidence?"    "Yes, he does. When underlings, led by a Marine lieutenant colonel try to  end-run the Oval Office and set up their own clandestine operation with the  Iranians, Ronnie deals with it as a President should."    "How's that?"    "He says he doesn't know anything about it."    "Is that the major plot of the film?"    "No. The real story is that Ron makes up with the Russians."    "Nobody is going to believe that. Reagan hates the Commies."    "That's the beauty of the plot. Ronnie, a man who detests Communists, finds  good in all of them. We have a big scene on top of the Kremlin wall when Ron  and Nancy embrace Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, as the Soviet troops  march by in the May Day parade."    "I thought Brezhnev was in charge of the U.S.S.R."    "In the picture we're changing his name to Gorbachev, and making the Russian  leader much younger for dramatic effect."    "It's a good script, but there doesn't appear to be any conflict in it. When  does Ron stand up and fight?"    "He doesn't -- but Nancy does. This movie portrays the struggle between two  strong-willed women trying to protect their men. I want to have a hair-pulling  fight between Nancy and Raisa in front of Lenin's Tomb."    "It sounds fine to me. How much will this production cost?"    He replied, "Would you believe a trillion dollars?"

Jane and Jerry  Weintraub also have a summer house near the Bushes' family place at  Kennebunkport, Me.    With such close presidential ties, Jane will be in the spotlight today at the  luncheon Robin Parsky of Pasadena and Grega Daly co-host in the Potomac Room of  the Ritz Carlton to introduce Jane to Washingtonians. The affair is timed so  that Almost-First Lady Barbara Bush can stop in after the Salute to the First  Lady at Kennedy Center.    Robin is the wife of Gerry Parsky, former U.S. assistant secretary of the  Treasury, a senior partner in Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher and a business  partner with former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury William Simon. Grega is the  wife of Leo A. Daly, whose large architectural firm designed the United  Airlines terminal at LAX; they live on Embassy Row on Massachusetts Avenue in  Washington.    The guest list is indicative of ascending social prowess: Acceptances are in  from Georgette Mosbacher, wife of the Secretary-designate of Commerce Robert  Mosbacher; Gayle Wilson, wife of California Sen. Pete Wilson, Penny Korth,  co-chairman of the Inaugural, and Joan Holt, wife of Bobby Holt, the other  co-chairman.

headline:   THE KITCHEN CABINET: HIGHER TECH IN IMPROVED COOKTOPS   
text:   Slowly, yet surely, the old electric range surface is being replaced in  kitchens all over the world by a sleek-looking cooktop. It's attractively  smooth. No more ugly burners sticking out. No nooks and crannies to clean.  (Remember how much extra time and effort you had to spend scrubbing those  grease-laden coil systems and rusted drip bowls, lest they become an eyesore in  the kitchen?)    The revolutionary, high-tech, smooth top is made of a heat-resistant glass  ceramic surface -- impervious to spills, grease and encrusted deposits. (Don't  mistake this for the old ceramic surfaces that developed instant heat stains  that were difficult to remove.) Today, this new cooking system accounts for  about 60% of all electric range sales in West Germany, 50% in Switzerland and  Austria and 45% in England. More than a dozen U.S. and Canadian appliance  manufacturers are now incorporating this system into their electric ranges.  Also, based on positive surveys, industry experts project an additional 75  million purchases over the next decade.    By now you've probably seen this new cooktop surface in ranges by companies  such as Amana, Dacor, Gaggenau, Caloric, Miele, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag,  Modern Maid, Roper, Kitchen Aid, Sears, Tappan, Creda and Thermador. Flush to  the countertop and looking extremely simple by way of its subtle smoothness,  there's more to the system than meets the eye. An intricate ingenuity lies in  both the composition of the glass panel as well as in the heating elements  hidden beneath the cooking surface.    Here's an inside story from the primary supplier of this product: Schott  America, a subsidiary of Schott Glaswerke of Mainz, West Germany. Called the  Ceran-Top-System, the unit consists of the following: a black glass-ceramic  panel; the hidden heating elements and their mountings; a steel frame has a  metallic finish or comes in one of several colors, and the burner controls.    The attractive glass-ceramic panels are translucent, nonporous and available in  several decorator designs with a wonderful variety of cooking zone placements.  But beauty is not only skin-deep; these glossy panels are made to withstand  constant temperatures of more than 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Sudden and severe  temperature changes do not affect them and as a result they don't crack or  warp. Another functional consideration is that they are designed to transmit  heat efficiently from the hidden burners directly up to the cookware, with the  rest of the surface remaining cool.    Depending on individual wants and needs, the Ceran systems are available with a  variety of electric heating options. The latest electric cooking systems  include radiant, high-speed, ballast, "quicklight" and halogen, the last of  which is attracting attention as an energy-saving concept. If you like the  instantaneous on-and-off response of gas, the halogen elements uses halogen  light bulbs that glow red when hot.    The beauty of this whole system is that all the heating coils and mountings are  hidden beneath a glass panel and are designed with consideration for safety and  maximum efficiency. The burners range from six to nine inches in diameter, some  designed with dual circuits to accommodate two sizes of cook pots. Temperature  limiters, which prevent the cooktop from overheating and aluminum pots from  melting, are standard equipment.    Speaking of pots, the manufacturer recommends a few simple rules of thumb to  get the best performance:    "Match the cookware and the cooking zone. The base of the pot or pan should be  as wide as the cooking zone on which it's used to get maximum efficiency and  shortest boiling times.    "Use heavy cookware with flat, smooth bottoms. Nothing fancy is required.  Commercially available pots and pans are fine. If made of metal, use thick  gauge. All cookware when hot, should sit flush on the cooking surface. Pots and  pans with flat, stainless-steel sandwich bottoms have produced the shortest  boiling times and maximum efficiency."    Cleaning, of course, is a cinch. Ordinary spills can easily be cleaned with  recommended cleaners applied to a moistened sponge or cloth. Avoid wool and  abrasive cleaners and treat spills that contain sugar immediately. Burnt  deposits can be easily removed with a razor-edged glass scraper.    Many buyers are attracted to this system by the bright red glow of the heating  elements that are visible through the glass-ceramic panel. Combined with this  visible glow, an indicator light that remains on until the surface is cool to  the touch ensures safe operation of the cooktop.

headline:   ABOUT WINE: MOUNTAIN OR COAST, TWO CABERNETS SHOW NAPA HAS NOTHING ON THEM   
text:   In some ways, there couldn't be two more dissimilar wine makers than Patrick  Campbell and Gary Eberle, but after the superficial elements are discarded, the  ways in which these two gentlemen make a similar statement with Cabernet  Sauvignon is striking.    Campbell, owner of Laurel Glen Vineyards in Sonoma County, is slight of build,  clean-shaven and rather reserved; Eberle, who owns Eberle Winery in Paso  Robles, is a big, burly bear of a man with a backwoods beard, a frame roughly  twice the size of Campbell's, and eyes that seem to radiate light of enthusiasm  and warmth.    Eberle was a football lineman at Penn State and had offers to turn pro;  Campbell, who suffered from polio at age 5 and has little use of his legs,  earned a living during and after college by playing the viola with symphony  orchestras.    Both today are wine makers in out-of-the-way regions not heavily traveled by  wine lovers, let alone potential wine lovers.      Two Brilliant Men    And yet in their own way, these two brilliant men are making strides with  Cabernet Sauvignon that rival what's being done in the better known Napa  Valley. Indeed, if either were in the Napa Valley, his fame would certainly be  more pervasive today than it is.    The use of the word brilliant above is not casual, and here the parallels  between them begin: Both earned master's degrees in fields unrelated to wine  making, Eberle in zoology (he came within an eyelash of a doctorate in  cytogenetics) at Louisiana State University, Campbell in philosophy, at  Harvard, no less. And both got into wine making more or less by a side door.  For neither wanted to do this for a living, preferring grape growing to wine  making.    But both had a sense of the artistic, and both also realized that raising the  grape through adolescence and then leaving it to be molded into its final adult  shape by another was not very fatherly.    Drawing comparisons between two such disparate souls and regions may be  stretching a point, but I felt it unavoidable after visiting with both recently  and realizing that often the fame of a wine is in relation to its region, and  that the current fad is to praise Napa Cabernet. It's almost as if that phrase  alone defines high quality.      Many Honors    Eberle, however, pointed out that his Cabernets, starting with the first in  1979, have won as many top honors in wine competitions as any other Cabernet in  California, and he wondered aloud why he must spend fully 181 days a year on  the road, traveling to various American cities to promote his brand.    And Campbell, who makes a Cabernet to rival anything done in California today,  acknowledges that were he in Napa, he'd probably be better recognized.    But both men also point out that if they were in Napa, they could never make  the wines they make, and both are extremely proud of the soils in which they  have chosen to sink their roots.    Eberle began his wine-making career at nearby Estrella River Winery and  actually got his feet wet first in planting various grape varieties in a  one-acre experimental plot. Working with the University of California at Davis,  Estrella's owners wanted to see what grapes grew best in this fertile soil an  hour's drive due west of the central San Joaquin Valley.    Eberle made wine at Estrella from 1977 through 1979. Then he and his wife,  Jeannie, left to open their own winery. At the time he toyed with the notion of  moving to the Napa Valley.    "But I asked myself, where were the best Cabernet grapes I had ever worked  with, and they are right here in Paso Robles," said Eberle, so he stayed. His  new winery, on California 46 just east of California 101, opened in 1984.    Meanwhile, Campbell had earned a degree at Cal Poly Pomona, and after two years  studying philosophy at Harvard with a religious specialty, he moved back to  California and into a Buddhist monastery, Genjo-Ji, on Sonoma Mountain behind  the small town of Glen Ellen.    "I'm pretty Spartan," said Campbell, adding, "when I saw they had a three-acre  vineyard, I jumped into it." He loved tending the vines (they were Palomino  grapes and were sold to Sebastiani for sherry production), and despite his  handicap, he handled most of the chores.    Soon after, he and his wife, Faith, found a 42-acre parcel of land less than a  third of a mile from the monastery; the name was Laurel Glen. Its Cabernet  grapes had long been sold to others, notably Kenwood and Chateau St. Jean, and  Campbell felt he would simply continue to sell grapes.    That was in 1976. Campbell started taking wine-making classes at Santa Rosa  Junior College and by 1979, a homemade wine from his own property turned out so  well he decided to make wine commercially. The first, in 1981, was a hit,  winning all sorts of awards and gaining instant fame for the modest fellow.    The soils that Eberle and Campbell till, and the climates in which they work,  are widely different, leading to different styles of wine.    In Paso Robles, Eberle works calcareous, sandy clay soil on gently sloped  vineyards. And the climate offers very warm summer days and cool nights. Huge  temperature swings are common, giving Eberle very cool nights even when daytime  temperatures soar near 100. This is due to an ocean breeze that wafts over a  low-sitting mountain to the west.    Sonoma Mountain is a small, remote appellation sitting above the lush Sonoma  Valley where Jack London wrote "Call of the Wild" and other novels. Few  wineries make wine from these grapes, and the reason is that production is  fairly limited in these rocky, sloped vineyards.    Rocks of every sort, from volcanic to petrified wood, fill the variegated soil  and make certain areas of the property better than others for wine. And the  climate here can be a little dicey, with temperatures in some years not truly  warm enough to get grapes fully ripe.    The wines of these two wineries are, thus, quite different. The Eberle Cabernet  tends more toward a combination of herbal and chocolate, with hints of pine and  tarragon. They are very consistent from year to year and appear to age best  within 10 years of their production.    The 1981 Eberle Cabernet, one of my favorites, sampled again recently, is  reaching a point of drinkability, though it will surely age well into the  1990s.    Laurel Glen wines have thus far been a little less consistent, and they tend to  be a little more tightly knit and less open when released. However, they are  also a little more approachable when first out because of an intriguing red  currant lilt to the otherwise raspberry-ish fruit. As the wine ages, hints of  mineral and dried basil smells are released.    The 1981 Laurel Glen, the first made by Campbell for commercial release, tasted  for comparison last week, was spectacular. The fruit has not only stayed around  for the ride but has opened further to reveal a slight anise quality to add to  the remaining "curranty" smells. It may be found on some restaurant wine lists  and is a grand experience.    Overall, the Laurel Glen wine is a bit more classic, needing perhaps 10 to 12  years in the bottle before it begins to open up fully. It is also a very  limited production wine (about 4,000 cases in a good year but far less in a  poor one) and now sells for $20 a bottle.    That may be a lot of money, but Cabernet was hard hit by weather problems in  1988 and Campbell has but 1,200 cases of that vintage for a market that is  increasing its demand for his wine as they discover it.    Eberle offers his Cabernets for $12. The wines are more California-like and  have a broader appeal, though they have the tannins needed for the aging, and  the '81 has now smoothed out sufficiently, indicating that seven years from the  harvest is what's needed.      Lots of Tannin    Both Campbell and Eberle admit that their growing regions are not the target of  NASA-type research, so each vintage for them is a new experience and they are  still experimenting. Laurel Glen's 1982 Cabernet, for instance, was not  particularly engaging, and Campbell admits he could have done much better with  it had he known then what he now knows.    To guard against problems like 1982 in the future, Campbell has developed a  second label, Counterpoint, that will be a lower-priced wine comprising some of  the barrels that don't add anything interesting to the Laurel Glen wine.    Both men also make other wines, with Eberle's Chardonnay another medal winner,  and a lovely, balanced effort every year. The 1986 ($12) is an excellent  example of fruit and richness not overdone. Laurel Glen made a small amount of  dessert-style wine similar to a Sauternes in 1985. The wine, called Cochino de  Oro, is superb (it sells for $12.50 a half bottle), but it's available only by  mail from the Winewright's Register. For details, call (800) 321-4300. Only 30  cases remain.      Handsome Tasting Room    Those interested in learning more about Eberle may visit his handsome tasting  room on California 46 four miles east of Highway 101.    As for Campbell, his small operation is located off a remote trail on Sonoma  Mountain and is hard to find. Moreover, Campbell still does most of the  vineyard work and wine-making himself, so he usually has little time for  visitors and consequently has no tasting room. Moreover, he and Faith have  three growing daughters, which makes him as much a family man as anything else.

headline:   LET'S EAT OUT: FETTUCCINE BAR OFFERS CHOICE OF 18 PASTAS   
text:   California Fettuccine Bar in Agoura Hills looked inviting as we pulled into the  parking lot. It was after dark and a soft glow from the pink walls and subtle  lighting inside was coming through the windows.    Three old gas pumps still stand guard over the entrance, but even before  California Fettuccine Bar opened a little more than two years ago, the building  had been occupied by another restaurant for some time. Sometime way back,  around the early '40's, however, it was actually a gas station.    The tiled entry leads to a large room with vaulted ceiling and wooden floor. It  has about 20 tables with pink-and-red linens and chrome and cane chairs. Six  more tables are on an adjacent enclosed front porch. A few plants and  contemporary art on the walls are about the only other additions to the simple  decor.    The rolls that were served soon after we were seated were one of the few  disappointments during our visits. We're guessing from the chewy texture that  they're warmed in an oven, but then microwaved at the last moment.    This shortcoming was quickly forgotten once the involtini di melanzane farcite  e peperoni arrostiti antipasti arrived at our table. The very thinly sliced  eggplant is broiled, then wrapped around goat cheese, marinated and served with  roasted red peppers on a bed of lightly dressed greens. Three of each item  makes it an ideal dish to share.    The main portion of the menu is devoted to 18 types of pasta, all, except the  tortellini and ravioli, prepared on the premises. These may be coupled with any  of the restaurant's 40 or so tomato, cream or specialty sauces. While pondering  our choices, we discovered an important point about this restaurant: Just  because something isn't on the printed menu, doesn't necessarily mean it's  unavailable.    A member of our party was sure she had ordered clam sauce on a previous  occasion, but couldn't find it listed. Questioning the waitress, we found clams  were not only available, but served in three different styles. (We understand  they will be included on the next menu to be printed.) So it pays to ask  questions, because that dozen clams, prepared with white wine, tomatoes and  basil and served on linguini, would have been a shame to miss.    It also pays to do a little eavesdropping. After ordering a glass of the house  Villa Banfi white wine, we overheard our waitress mention to the next table  that a Venegazzu Pinot Grigio was offered by the glass. It turned out to be  drier and more to our liking.    None of this is intended to say that service is lacking. On the contrary, it's  friendly and attentive. With a list of evening specials to present verbally  (also listed on a large blackboard, but not visible from all tables), it's easy  to understand a wine being overlooked or someone not mentioning items such as  the clams.    Besides, staff recommendations proved to be on target. We took the advice of  having the salsa ai carciofi served with fettuccine al basilico, and it was a  winner. The basil-flavored pasta was an excellent foil for the surprisingly  light sauce of cream, baby artichokes, garlic and parsley sauce.    A nightly special 14-ounce veal chop was not as lean as we expected, but had an  intriguing sauce of radicchio, pancetta, tomatoes and wood-ear mushrooms.  Because of the size, two of us had mentioned we would share the entree and,  without our asking, it was sliced horizontally and arranged on two plates in  the kitchen.    Again, when it came to ordering dessert, it paid to ask questions. Although a  chocolate-plum and hazelnut torte were very acceptable, we later learned they  were not made in the restaurant. The Kaluha pecan pie our waitress presented  after we asked her for the best in-house dessert, was by far the best of the  trio. A very foamy cappuccino complemented it well.     California Fettuccine Bar, 29008 Agoura Road, Agoura Hills, (818) 991-3000. A  sister restaurant to La Bruschetta and Westwood Fettuccine Bar.

headline:   FOOD BRIEFS: SHRIMP FARMING BOOMS   
text:   Commercial shrimp farming has increased dramatically in the last seven years,  causing retail prices to drop and threatening the livelihood of fishermen,  according to a San Diego-based trade publication.    Last year, for instance, farms were responsible for producing 22% of the  world's supply of this expensive and popular crustacean, Aquaculture Digest  recently reported.    "The industry has quietly grown into a multibillion-dollar giant, lowering the  prices in some markets and sending tremors through the shrimp-fishing  industry," the article stated.    Just as quietly, farmed shrimp have become the world's largest and most  valuable aquaculture species, easily surpassing similar efforts to cultivate  salmon, catfish and trout.    More than 450,000 metric tons of farm-raised shrimp came to market last year  with a $6 billion retail value. And total tonnage would have been 10% greater  had not Bangladesh and Taiwan both experienced problems with their operations,  the magazine found.    Most shrimp aquaculture ventures are based in Asia, with the People's Republic  of China believed to be the world leader with 22% of the total production.  Other major producers include Ecuador, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand and the  Philippines.    Aquaculture Digest estimates that more than 40 countries farm shrimp to some  degree whether in inland ponds, tanks or along coastal bays. The United States  plays only a minor role in the global industry, and the domestic effort, about  20 facilities, is based in South Carolina, Texas and Hawaii.    The cumulative effect of these ventures has caused the wholesale and retail  prices of medium-sized shrimp to decline. Farmers have yet to successfully  produce the larger varieties; prices for these shrimp species remain unchanged  and, in some cases, have even increased.    There is a centuries-old tradition of fish farming in Southeast Asia. The  modern industry, however, dates back only to the late 1970s.    Despite the successes of the last decade, the process is vulnerable. According  to Aquaculture Digest, Bangladesh lost much of its 1988 crop because of floods.  The reason for a 70% reduction in Taiwan's harvest last year has yet to be  ascertained.    Natural disasters aside, the industry's greatest obstacle continues to be the  difficulties in hatching shrimp larvae. The hatcheries remain the "weakest  link" in the process, according to the report, because larvae are readily  susceptible to bacterial and viral disease there.    Even so, the technology is much more reliable and cost-effective than the  labor-intensive fishing methods in practice today. Furthermore, the wild-shrimp  population has been depleted throughout the world because of overfishing and a  general deterioration in water quality.    "A farmer can produce shrimp cheaper than a fisherman can catch them," said Bob  Rosenberry, publisher of Aquaculture Digest.    Because of this disparity the fisherman will eventually become obsolete, he  said.    Aquaculture Digest estimates that several countries are undergoing a "boom" in  shrimp farming that will far surpass current production levels, notably  Thailand, the Philippines and China.    Of regional importance, Mexico has also made a major financial commitment to  aquaculture despite the presence of a sizable shrimp fleet.    "Shrimp farming is on the verge of taking off in Mexico. Currently it has 70  farms, eight hatcheries, 25,000 acres in production and annual (harvest) of  9,000 metric tons," the article stated.    "Shrimp farming is developing at a very rapid pace throughout the world," said  Rosenberry. "Some countries, such as Mexico and India, are just starting to  jump into the business. When production from those two comes on line it will  lower prices even more."    Mistaken Impressions -- As some ingredient-conscious consumers may have known  all along, many products promoted as health foods are far from being  nutritionally superior to more conventional choices.    The UC Berkeley Wellness Letter recently reviewed the category and found  numerous faults with several of the more popular items.    "Don't be too quick to trust those labels that promise nutritional nirvana,"  the newsletter stated. "A food that has no cholesterol may still have lots of  fat or sodium. The presence of 'natural' ingredients is no guarantee of good  nutrition, nor is the absence of refined sugar, preservatives (and other  additives)."    The newsletter, published by the university's School of Public Health,  encourages consumers to monitor so-called natural foods for potential dietary  pitfalls. The best such method is simple: read the ingredient list printed on  the label. The various components of the food are listed in descending order  based on weight and, thus, provide a profile of a product's nutritional status.    The Wellness Letter skewered some health foods by using just such information,  in addition to basic eating guidelines.      High Fat Content    For instance, most people would be "better off" consuming a sugar-laden apple  pie then some of the commercial carrot cakes on the market, the newsletter  stated. Typically high in fat content, carrot cakes usually weigh in at about  200 calories a slice or more -- and that's without considering the likely  garnishes such as frosting or cream cheese.    "Sure, carrots are healthful, but carrot cakes are surprisingly rich in  drawbacks," according to the report.    The same applies to many of the bran muffins on the market. Much has been made  of the important role that bran, and its attendant fiber, can play in the diet.  Even so, most of the commercial muffins available are loaded with more  hydrogenated oils, sugar and eggs than oat or wheat bran. Determining whether  these muffins are healthful depends, in part, upon whether they contain the  nutritionally superior whole-wheat flour instead of more refined varieties, the  review stated.    "If a muffin weighs heavily in your hand and has a sticky surface, it is likely  to have as many calories and fat as a cupcake," according to the Wellness  Letter.    Certain types of popcorn also warrant scrutiny, the newsletter stated. Plain  popcorn -- if cooked without butter and salt -- is a no-fat and low-calorie  food. But when excess amounts of oil are used in either the at-home or  commercial versions, then the benefits are quickly lost.      Read the Label    "Microwave corn and prepopped corn usually contain twice as many calories as  conventional popcorn, (as well as) a hefty dose of salt and more fat per ounce  than most cookies," the report found.    Those concerned with fat intake should also be cautioned about commercial  "vegetarian pate." In order to compensate for the fatty texture found in  traditional liver pates, the vegetable version often employs tropical oils such  as palm kernel. These oils, which also includes coconut, are more highly  saturated than some animal fats, according to the article. Diets high in  saturated fats have been linked to increased risk of heart disease.    Also worth considering is that the predominant vegetable in many of the  commercial pates is potato starch, the Wellness Letter stated.    Certain frozen foods, particularly those labeled as "vegetarian," pose some  nutritional problems. One popular vegetable lasagna, the report found,  contained only 225 calories, but 50% of those were from fat. A competing meat  lasagna, on the other hand, had only 32% of its calories from saturated fat.    "Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by a healthy-sounding name,"  the Wellness Letter stated. "Always read labels."

headline:   HINTS FROM HELOISE: MAKING AN INSTANT LID FROM HOT PLASTIC WRAP   
text:   DEAR HELOISE: Last week I took some pork and beans in a glass bowl to a potluck  dinner. I didn't have a lid for the bowl and I knew the beans would, no doubt,  spill in my car on the way.    Then I remembered how plastic wrap clings to the sides of any glass bowl when  heated in the microwave oven. I heated the beans on HIGH (100%) for a couple of  minutes and the plastic wrap created a tight seal so the beans didn't make a  mess.    Some of the lids on my casserole dishes aren't very tight, so this tip could  also be used to make sure food doesn't spill while being transported even when  it has a lid. Also, the plastic wrap seal keeps the food hot longer.     -- KELLY, Chandler, Ariz.    DEAR KEITH: There is an easy solution to this. Just mix one cup of rubbing  alcohol to a quart of water and use this solution on the cloth when cleaning  the freezer. Since rubbing alcohol will not freeze, the cloth will not stick.     -- HELOISE    DEAR HELOISE: My mother-in-law told me the best way to make poached eggs. First  of all, spray the pan lightly with a non-stick vegetable spray, fry the eggs  until the whites are barely set, then add about one tablespoon of water. Cover  tightly and turn the heat down very low.    The result is a semi-poached egg that is not greasy and there is no turning  needed.     -- RUTH, Honeoye, N.Y.

DEAR VIRGINIA: This is a perfect example of when less is more. By simply  reducing the problem ingredients in the recipe, you end up with a finished  product that is more enjoyable from both a health and taste standpoint.    The margarine was easily reduced by half and egg substitute worked beautifully  in place of the eggs, so the fat and cholesterol are greatly reduced. I have  found that low-fat Cheddar cheese is always appropriate as a substitute for the  traditional high-fat variety, and I was able to reduce the amount of cheese  called for without missing it.

headline:   THE BUTCHER: SIMPLE WAYS TO SAVE AT THE MARKET   
text:   In my opinion, we can eat a lot better for a lot less if we follow a few simple  common-sense procedures when shopping in the American supermarket. The average  supermarket today has hundreds of thousands of different items lining its  shelves to tempt us into parting with as much of our cash as possible. Most of  those items we don't need. The trick is to shop for and buy what we really want  and need, and not to be tempted by the things we can do without.    The place to begin shopping is at home around the kitchen table on the day the  Food Section comes out in this paper. The advertised specials offer good  opportunity for savings -- particularly on meat. Items like whole body  chickens, turkeys and often various cuts of beef, pork and lamb are often used  as loss-leaders. That means they offer these items for less than they paid for  them in order to get you into the store, where you can be tempted by all those  thousands of other items that are not "on special."    Plan weekly menus around some of the advertised specials and make a list . . .  but don't carve it in stone and carry it to the market like Moses coming down  from the mountain. Be a little flexible. Not all money-saving specials are  advertised. That is particularly true in the meat department where the  department manager often lowers the price of a particular cut in order to move  it.      Shop at Same Market    Unless there is some red-hot special that makes it worth a special trip, you  are best off doing most of your shopping at the same market every week. Pick a  convenient one where the clerks are reasonably friendly and helpful and get to  know it. Learn where things are and who to go to for help if you need any. The  more familiar you are with the layout, the less time you'll need to spend there  and, believe it, time is money -- the more time you spend shopping, the more  money you'll spend.    Try to do the major portion of shopping on one day. More people spend more  money on groceries -- meat in particular -- because they shop for only one meal  at a time. When you go shopping with "What am I going to have for dinner  tonight?" in mind, you are almost certainly looking for something quick. You  know as well as I do that one of the most expensive and often overpriced  supermarket commodities is called convenience. A frozen entree can cost 10  times what the same dish would cost if you planned ahead and made it from  scratch.    A steak or a pork chop may cook quickly, but you'll pay far less per pound for  either if you plan ahead, buy a family pack or a roast and cut your own and  freeze some for later use.    In my opnion, thinking big can save you a fortune, not only on meat but  throughout the store. When chickens are on special, buy several, cut them up  and package the component parts in serving size portions for the freezer. Buy a  couple of first-cut blade chucks when they're on sale. Even if you don't have  the time or inclination for a pot roast, there are all kinds of different meals  to be made from a chuck roast if you'll do a little cutting up in the kitchen.  You can make steaks, stew, stir-fry meat or ground chuck for all kinds of  recipes from a couple of inexpensive chuck roasts.      If the Price Is Right    A leg of lamb on special may be far more than you need for one meal, but if the  price is right, don't pass it by -- buy it. Ring the bell and ask the butcher  to bone it for you, then separate the individual muscles to make smaller  roasts, chops, cutlets or stew meat, all of which will likely cost less than  similar cuts in the same meat case.    The meat counter is not the only place in the store where it pays to think big.  Things like rice, barley, macaroni and spaghetti keep almost forever and they  are always less expensive per pound if you buy the larger package. You can  sometimes get staples at half price if you buy big. The people who pay most for  what they buy are those who shop one meal at a time for only one or two people.  Even if you are cooking for only one or two, you can save money if you plan  ahead and buy for the freezer rather than waiting till the last minute and  buying something "quick" from the frozen food case at the supermarket.    Finally, check out the "outer limits." The outside perimeter of most  supermarkets is where you will find most of the unprocessed foods from the four  basic food groups -- dairy, meat and other protein, breads, and fruits and  vegetables. Try shopping the outer limits and spending as little time as  possible in the "inner zone." In my opinion, not only will you save money but  you will feed your family more wholesome, nutritious meals. The "inner zone" is  where you will find all those high-fat, high-sugar fun foods that your body as  well as your budget can well do without.

headline:   YOU ASKED ABOUT : TOMATOES IN CANS THAT HAVE RUSTED STILL SAFE TO EAT   
text:   Question: We have several cans of tomatoes that have become rusted on both ends  -- not swollen, but rusted. Apparently, my storing them in a bath house was not  a great idea. I was going to toss them out, but my husband insisted that I  write to you because he and a neighbor think the contents are still safe to  use. Would appreciate your help.    Answer: We checked with the Canned Food Information Council in Chicago and  learned they agree with your husband and neighbor. As long as there is no  damage to the seams and no leakage from the cans, the ingredients should still  be safe to consume. In the future, however, it would be best to store canned  goods in a place with less humidity.    Q: Do the new reduced-cholesterol eggs react the same as regular eggs in  baking?    A: Yes, according to Helen Bauch, Food Technologist for the California Egg  Commission in Upland, the reduced-cholesterol eggs are used exactly the same as  regular eggs.    For those unfamiliar with the reduced-cholesterol eggs, Rosemary Farm, a Santa  Maria-based firm has achieved a 50% reduction in the cholesterol content of  eggs by providing hens a specially designed feed. The eggs contain  approximately 125 milligrams per egg and are priced about 60 cents more per  dozen, according to an Oct. 25 article in The Times.    Q: I would like to know how to make candied kumquats like you see at Christmas  in fruit packs. I have a tree that is loaded with the fruit.    A: This recipe is adapted from "Fancy Pantry" (Workman Publishing: 1986) by  Helen Witty.    CANDIED KUMQUATS    2 pounds bright-skinned, firm kumquats    5 cups sugar    3 cups water    Superfine sugar, optional    Rinse kumquats and remove any stems. If skins have any small rusty spots, scrub  with small stiff brush to remove as much of discoloration as possible.    Place kumquats in saucepan and add enough cold water to cover fruit by 1 inch.  Bring to boil, partially cover pan, and simmer fruit 10 minutes. Drain kumquats  in colander.    In same saucepan, combine sugar and water and bring to boil. Boil syrup 5  minutes, then add well-drained kumquats. Bring fruit just to boil over  medium-high heat, then lower heat and simmer kumquats, uncovered, 10 minutes.  Pour fruit and syrup into shallow bowl and let stand overnight, covered with  cloth.    Return kumquats and syrup to saucepan, bring to boil and simmer 20 minutes, or  until fruit is translucent and tender when tested with cake tester or thin  skewer. If syrup should become very thick and may scorch before fruit is done,  add small amount boiling water and continue cooking.    When kumquats are tender, remove pan from heat and cool fruit in syrup. Lift  kumquats from syrup one at a time and arrange on wire rack set over baking  sheet. Let drain and dry at room temperature until kumquats are no longer  sticky to touch, from 1 to 2 hours to overnight, depending on level of  humidity.    If weather is damp and fruit dries slowly, set rack in oven set at lowest or  keep warm temperature and leave, with oven door ajar, until no longer sticky.  Roll kumquats in superfine sugar and store in airtight container at room  temperature. Roll again in superfine sugar just before serving. Makes 2 pounds.

headline:   THE RICH CULINARY TRADITION OF PARMESAN CHEESE SPANS 7 CENTURIES;    'CHEESE DETECTIVE' CONSORTIUM SAFEGUARDS ITS AGES-OLD REPUTATION   
text:   For its makers, Parmesan cheese is not just something to grate and sprinkle  over pasta.    It is rooted in folklore spanning seven centuries and the dairy farmers around  Parma in northern Italy who make it do not take kindly to imitations  masquerading as the real thing.    For several years their consortium has been policing cheese sellers in Italy,  but with the approach of a unified European market in 1992 they are now hoping  to extend their tough rules to the rest of the community.    A small squad of consortium "cheese detectives" stakes out shops, street  markets and restaurants, mostly in Italy but also in France and Switzerland  where the Parmesan name is guaranteed under bilateral agreements.    "The consortium has limited means so we depend mostly on food industry  officials and consumers to tell us about infringements. But we also use four to  six of our employees to make inspections," consortium president Giampaolo Mora  said.    Under an Italian law passed in the 1950s cheese can carry the Parmesan name  only if it is made according to a 700-year-old method in a small area defined  by natural boundaries including the Po River.    Unlike Grana, a similar cheese in taste and texture produced north of the Po,  Parmesan contains no artificial additives and is made entirely by hand. It also  costs up to 25% more.      Definitely Not the Real Thing    Mora, a lawyer and a Christian Democrat senator, said his organization was  fighting several small companies in the courts. "There are many retailers  selling what they call Parmesan which is definitely not the real thing," he  said.    Mora and representatives of five other EC countries thrashed out the text of an  agreement defining the cheese in Paris and he said he was lobbying for its  extension to other member nations.    "Italians know Parmesan when they see it, but foreigners are more easily taken  in," he said.    Just outside Parma at the Baganzolino cooperative, one of 930 farms authorized  to produce Parmesan, you begin to appreciate the cheese's near-mystical  prestige.    Across the flat Po Valley plains, which in winter are almost permanently  shrouded in low mist, cows eat only fresh grass or hay. Other feed lowers the  quality of their milk and affects Parmesan's golden-yellow hue.    Milk is left in metal basins overnight and then skimmed. After being heated in  a copper vat for an hour, a solid mass forms which is drawn out with a  long-handled metal sieve.      Only Natural Ingredients    While Grana manufacturers use an artificial setting agent at this stage,  Parmesan makers just add rennet, a coagulant found in calves' stomachs.    The 260 gallons of milk in each vat reduce to just two big cheeses, which are  pressed out in a circular wooden mold about 18 inches in diameter and left to  solidify.    The cheese is then immersed for a month in salt solution and stencilled with  the Parmesan stamp and a code number to identify the farm which made it.    At Baganzolino cheeses are stored on stacks 21 shelves high like books in a  library. During the two years it takes them to mature they are regularly turned  and brushed to avoid the build-up of mold.      Traditional Methods    The master cheese maker will use a metal hammer to test each cheese for the  right sound and extract samples with a spiral hook for chemical analysis.    "Making Parmesan is a ritual," Mora said. "The only thing which has changed in  700 years is that the milk is heated by gas instead of wood."    It is also big business. The consortium has a turnover of $950 million each  year, producing two and a half million cheeses. It exports only 6% of its  output, but Mora said the European market was expanding fast.    Whether because of the geographical location or the devoted precision with  which the farmers make the cheese, it seems that Parmesan is indeed impossible  to imitate elsewhere.    Mora said a farm in Normandy tried making it with local milk following the  traditional method but failed to reproduce the fragrance and rich crumbly  texture which make Parmesan as delicious eaten as a dessert cheese as when  grated on spaghetti.    "Before being a great cheese it is art, life, an almost sacred symbol of  peasant culture," the consortium's director, Luigi Verrini, has written.    Transferring that culture abroad defeated even Thomas Jefferson, who wanted to  start making the cheese in the newly independent United States 200 years ago.    After he became President in 1801, Jefferson wrote to an Italian friend: "You  were right, it's better to leave Parmesan making to the people who know what  they are doing."

headline:   FPPC INVESTIGATING HAWTHORNE'S VOTES;    CALTRANS CHAIRMAN HAD VOWED TO ABSTAIN ON PROJECTS INVOLVING HIS EQUIPMENT FIRM   
text:   The state Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating whether a  prominent San Diego County businessman has violated state conflict-of-interest  laws by voting to approve millions of dollars of construction projects as a  member of the California Transportation Commission, sources said Wednesday.    J. Thomas Hawthorne of Escondido, the exclusive dealer of Caterpillar heavy  equipment in San Diego, pledged almost three years ago to abstain on  Transportation Commission votes involving San Diego County after it was  reported that the builders of almost every local highway project buy or rent  equipment from his company.    Since then, Hawthorne has voted for 52 area projects worth $164 million,  according to a report prepared for the state Senate Rules Committee.    The FPPC probe could endanger Hawthorne's seat on the commission, to which he  has been renominated for a second four-year term by Gov. George Deukmejian. He  is now chairman of the commission.    Sen. President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said Wednesday that he  will delay a scheduled Senate floor vote on Hawthorne's appointment while the  FPPC reviews the matter. If the Senate does not act by Feb. 1, Hawthorne will  lose his seat on the commission.      Checking With Contractors    A Senate source said the FPPC has asked the Transportation Commission for a  list of construction contracts awarded on the 52 San Diego projects for which  Hawthorne voted. FPPC investigators will then check with the contractors to  determine how much of that business went to Hawthorne's firm, the source said.    Neither Hawthorne nor the FPPC's spokeswoman could be reached for comment  Wednesday.    In a Jan. 4 appearance before the Senate Rules Committee, Hawthorne said his  votes were not a conflict of interest because San Diego County has received  less highway money than legally allowed under the Legislature's formula for the  allocation of state funds. He said his votes did not bring the county any more  money than it was already entitled to.    After The Times disclosed Hawthorne's possible conflict in 1985, the FPPC  reviewed his votes and determined that customers of his business had received  90% of the $55.6 million worth of projects approved for San Diego County during  Hawthorne's first 18 months on the commission.    The watchdog agency refrained from fining Hawthorne for a conflict of interest  but warned him not to vote on projects that could benefit his business. It was  then that Hawthorne pledged to abstain.    "When jobs are let in this area, I'm going to have to abstain from voting on  them," he told The Times.

headline:   NO PLACE LIKE HOME -- ANYPLACE;    MIGRANTS TEAR DOWN HUTS AS EVICTION NEARS   
text:   Rafael Martinez hurried to sell his home of three years Tuesday, quickly  agreeing to the buyer's price -- 20 cents a kilo for the wood and scrap metal  and $3 each for the two mattresses inside.    In all, Martinez earned a tidy $230 from the sale of his home, one of almost a  hundred plywood hooches in this migrant's camp in the coastal town of  Encinitas.    "This is enough to get me back to Tijuana and take care of me for a couple of  weeks," Martinez said. "I've had it. I could deal with the Border Patrol. But  how did the health department do this to us?"    Indeed, the about 125 remaining inhabitants of the Valle Verde squatters' camp  are asking the same question. The camp's residents include migrants from Mexico  and several other Latin American countries, many of whom have qualified for the  Immigration and Naturalization Service's year-old amnesty program.    Valle Verde was founded more than a decade ago, when the first residents  erected plywood shanties and camouflaged them on the chaparral-covered  hillsides across the road from affluent La Costa. The camp sits on El Camino  Real, near Olivenhain Road, sprawled across a couple of hundred acres of prime  coastal property, less than a mile from Carlsbad State Beach and the Pacific.    Before development began to encroach, Valle Verde was one of many migrant  worker camps spread across San Diego County's isolated northern area, close to  the nurseries and agricultural fields where thousands of aliens have been  traditionally employed. Over the years, the workers have lived through frequent  raids by Border Patrol agents, who were seen as more of a nuisance than a  threat.      Complaints by Residents    But the San Diego County Health Services Department has accomplished in the  last six months what the Border Patrol had been unable to do in years. Last  summer, reacting to many complaints from area residents of trash, noise and the  growth of the primitive camp, county health officials declared Valle Verde a  health hazard and ordered the property owners -- the wealthy Texas Hunt  brothers -- to abate the site.    Earlier this month, after the abatement plan was approved by the California  Coastal Commission, the property owners posted notices in Spanish and English  throughout the camp telling the migrants that they had until Feb. 1 to leave.  The cleanup was left to the supervision of the leaseholder of the property,  Frank Wright &amp; Sons, a construction company.    Daryl (Ben) Benstead, who is overseeing the cleanup for the leaseholder, and  Wright came up with a plan to pay the migrants for razing the camp. The men are  paying 20 cents a kilo (equivalent to 2.2 pounds) for wood and scrap metal, $3  per mattress and 50 cents for each plastic bag filled with trash.    Benstead tried to stop the evictions, apologized to the migrants in a letter  and called them "good neighbors." He does not try to hide his bitterness over  the eviction. "I have no faith in human nature anymore. . . . I'm kind of  emotionally spent over this," said Benstead.    By Tuesday afternoon, the second day of the program, migrants had been paid  more than $1,000 for the scrap. The debris brought down from the hills by the  migrants had filled two 40-cubic-yard trash bins. Silvino Ruiz, one of  Benstead's helpers, was towing a portable scale around, weighing and recording  the loads.      'Where Do We Go?'    Although county officials have succeeded in uprooting the migrants, they have  failed in attempts to find them housing. In a much-publicized move, county  officials announced in November that attempts would be made to find subsidized  housing for the about 12 families with children who live at Valle Verde. As of  Wednesday, none of the families had found housing.    Several migrants said that they will simply move to another camp farther north,  near Palomar Airport. A large number said they will wait until Feb. 1, when the  leaseholder will stop paying for scrap and trash and begin tearing down the  camp, and then decide where to go. Others, emboldened by their legal status,  talked about mounting a protest.    But the question heard over and over in the camp was, "Where do we go from  here?"    "Why are the authorities doing this to us? We have no place to go. Most of us  will just find another hillside or canyon to live," said a man called Tiburon.  "I don't understand gringos. In 1985, when I almost drowned at Carlsbad Beach,  they used a helicopter to save me. Now they're telling me to get out of the  only house I have. Why did they save me?"

headline:   VICTIMS OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL SHOOTING ARE FORCED TO COPE AGAIN 10 YEARS LATER   
text:   Christy Buell was "shocked, saddened, horrified" by the headlines.    Tuesday, a killer walked onto a schoolyard in Stockton and opened fire on  children, killing five and wounding 29 with bursts from a semiautomatic rifle.  A teacher was also wounded in the assault, which lasted only three to four  minutes.    For Buell, the news was a grim reminder, an ugly blast of history repeating  itself. She was one of eight children wounded Jan. 29, 1979 -- almost exactly a  decade ago -- when teen-age sniper Brenda Spencer opened fire on schoolchildren  in San Diego.    Part of the creepy flashback for Buell was learning that the school in Stockton  bears the same name as the one in San Diego -- Cleveland Elementary.    "I was scared for those people," Buell said Wednesday, adding that she was  "shaking" just in having to discuss the incident in an interview. "I felt  really sorry for them, because I know exactly what they're feeling . . . . I  went through the same terrible thing."    Buell, 19, was then a 9-year-old fourth-grader still coping with the death of  her mother, who lost the battle to leukemia when her daughter was 2. Buell said  the grief her father felt -- losing a wife, almost losing a daughter -- was  unimaginable.    Buell now works at a day-care center not far from where the shootings occurred.  Her work with children has made her wonder all the more why someone would ever  want to harm them. Buell was shot twice by Spencer -- in the abdomen and in the  lower back. She was hospitalized for a month and spent 18 months recuperating.    "There's no other way to say it," she said with a quivering voice. "I'll just  never get over it."    She suffers no physical repercussions, only the psychological fallout, which  she compared to a kind of post-traumatic stress syndrome, not unlike that  experienced by some veterans of the Vietnam War. The same can be said not only  by victims but also their parents.    Lee Selvig is an attorney, a family law specialist in San Diego. His daughter,  Monica, now 18, was shot in the stomach, the bullet exiting her back close to  the spine. She suffers no lasting physical effects, although Selvig asked that  Monica not be interviewed; he would speak for her.    "I'm not going to deny the trauma," he said. "Even before yesterday (Tuesday),  the incident was constantly on the minds of the family. We haven't been able to  shake it. I heard Michael Mantell (a San Diego psychologist) interviewed on  radio this morning, and he pointed out something really beneficial. He said  families must emphasize the positive at a time like this. I have to say it  improved our family's relationships, drew us closer together. It had to. It  also impressed upon us how fragile our    lives really are. It woke us up to our own mortality."    Selvig said the school's bearing the same name carried an eerie afterglow that  was almost indescribable.      'Happening All Over'    "It's strange, but that alone made it seem the nightmare was happening all over  again," he said. "It made our incident close and all too frightening."    Selvig sees as one of the saddest tragedies Monica's losing of an illusion.  Much like children in Belfast or Beirut, he said, those wounded at Cleveland  Elementary in San Diego 10 years ago were shocked into the world of adult  reality without being allowed to make the transition gradually.    "A child has the right to grow up feeling that they're out of harm's way,"  Selvig said. "They have a right to a childlike aura of invincibility. Brenda  Spencer took that away from Monica forever."    Julie Robles, 20, suffered a gunshot wound to the side that day in San Diego.  Doctors marveled that the bullet that struck Robles passed right through her --  almost hitting her kidneys but striking no major organs and leaving her with  only a minor injury.    The psychological wound was greater.      'Terribly Upsetting'    "The Stockton thing was terribly upsetting and disturbing," she said. "I was  very upset by the date being so close to the 10th anniversary of our shooting  and the name of the school being the same."    For a decade, Robles has been traumatized by news accounts of snipers or  gun-wielding psychopaths walking into a public place and opening fire. She  wrestles with the feelings for days, and, just when it seems she's over it, she  hears about a Stockton.    Thoughts seem to leap out of nowhere that tear at her spirit and toy with her  equilibrium. She actually thinks about Brenda Spencer from time to time,  wondering if the woman is safely locked up -- she is, in the California  Institution for Women in Frontera -- and whether she will ever return to do  Robles harm.      Informing Friends    From time to time, she has the strange task of informing a new friend that  once, on a school ground in San Diego, she was shot in an incident that made  the national news.    "I tell them, and they just look at me stunned," Robles said. "Their reaction  is one of total disbelief. They say, 'No way, Julie.' They just can't believe  it."    For Christy Buell, the saddest memory is that two men she knew -- good men --  were slain that day. Spencer murdered Principal Burton Wragg and custodian  Michael Suchar.    "The loss of two men that put their lives in danger to save children . . .  that's the hardest part for me," Buell said, "the part no one will ever undo."

headline:   'QUAINT, MARKET-LIKE ATMOSPHERE';    CARLSBAD STREET PLAN HAS COMPETITIVE EDGE   
text:   Carlsbad business and civic leaders, hoping that a revitalized downtown will  spur new business ventures and attract consumers, have pledged their support  for a project that is expected to give the city's prominent thoroughfares a new  look.    The City Council on Tuesday authorized local redevelopment officials to solicit  bids from contractors who will give a face lift to the downtown's two major  streets, Carlsbad Boulevard and Elm Avenue, said John Cahill, the city's  municipal projects manager.    The Carlsbad Redevelopment Agency is spearheading the $8-million "streetscape  project," which includes plans to widen and rebuild streets, construct a  sculpture park, build a pedestrian mall and install fountains and decorative  paving, Cahill said.      'Destination Spot'    Project advocates say the improvements will not only enhance the coastal city's  appearance but establish the city as a "destination spot" and a retail center  capable of competing with North County's growing number of shopping malls.    Council members unanimously approved the $1.8-million second stage of the  project at Tuesday's meeting. The improvements are to be made in five stages,  with completion scheduled for early 1991, Cahill said.    The decision allows the city to solicit bids from contractors to begin the  second stage, which calls for the rebuilding of Carlsbad Boulevard, from Walnut  Street to Buena Vista Lagoon. The money allocated in the second phase will also  be used to improve Elm Avenue, from Ocean Street to Washington Street.    "When the Redevelopment Agency was established in 1981, one of its long-term  goals was to improve and revitalize the core    area along Carlsbad Boulevard and Elm Avenue," said Cahill, who will be  responsible for overseeing the construction.    "We have been interested in improving the area to promote tourism and the  business area and establish effective traffic and pedestrian circulation," he  said.    The project, which was approved in concept last February by the council, calls  for the rebuilding and expansion of Elm Avenue from two lanes to four from Pio  Pico Drive to the ocean. It also calls for the rebuilding of Carlsbad Boulevard  from its northern end to Ocean Street.    Landscaped medians are planned for both thoroughfares.      Architectural Award    The project, which will also adorn streets with several art projects, received  a landscaping award in December from the American Society of Landscape  Architects, said Chris Salomone, the city's redevelopment director.    Such improvements will result in a dramatic change from the city's appearance  in the late 1960s and early '70s, when it was tarnished with many run-down  areas, according to Mayor Bud Lewis.    When the redevelopment agency was established in 1981, it was charged with  removing those decaying structures by coordinating the efforts of city  officials, merchants and residents, Lewis said.    Meanwhile, the streetscape project developed from simultaneous efforts to  enhance the city's image by creating a village environment and bolstering its  economic position, Salomone said.    "The downtown area was incredibly impacted by the regional mall," he said. "We  knew we couldn't compete head-to-head against the malls that have these big  anchor stores. So we decided to persuade people to spend money here by creating  a quaint, market-like atmosphere with specialty-type retail stores."    The first phase of the project was, in essence, approved when the City Council  blessed plans by developers to construct Village Faire, a 3.7-acre retail  center at the intersection of Carlsbad Boulevard and Elm Avenue.      Agreed to Incorporate Ideas    Salomone said the developers have agreed to incorporate the city's streetscape  plans into their plans for the retail center. The city will contribute about  $400,000 to the first stage of the project, which is expected to begin in  mid-March.    The other stages of the project include:    * A $500,000 outdoor sculpture park, scheduled for construction this fall at  Ocean Street and Carlsbad Boulevard.    * Improvements along Elm Avenue, from Washington Street to Pio Pico Drive,  during the summer of 1990. This fourth stage is expected to cost at least $3  million.    * Three downtown parking lots to be built this summer at a cost of $1.5  million.    "Personally, I think it's a great idea to spruce up the village area," said  Scott Little, president of the Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce. "We're always  concerned about the tourism factor, and this will make Carlsbad a destination  spot. But I think this will do a lot to attract local residents to the area,  too."    To bring even more dollars to Carlsbad, redevelopment officials have decided to  rename Elm Avenue, calling it Carlsbad Village Drive.    "The name change was a blatant economic move," Salomone said. "That sign will  be out on Interstate 5, and we're hoping that people will say, 'Hey, there's a  village here, let's go check it out.' "    "Elm Avenue is a generic name," Salomone said. "But Carlsbad Village Drive . .  . that will attract people off I-5 and bring them into Carlsbad."

text:   A report to the Los Angeles County Small Craft Harbor Commission recommends  elimination of a makeshift sanctuary for abandoned bunnies, baby chicks and  ducklings in a Marina del Rey flood control basin.    Commissioner Mark Nathanson, who conducted a public hearing on the matter in  October, said in the report that the commission should remove the animals from  the 10.5-acre Oxford Flood Control Basin.    County officials said that people tired of bunnies, baby chicks and ducklings  that were given as gifts on Christmas and Easter began dumping the creatures in  the basin about 10 years ago. In 1982, volunteers began feeding and caring for  the abandoned birds and animals.    Some nearby residents, complaining of noise and odors, have asked county  officials to remove the animals.    The commission will consider the matter on Monday.

headline:   HOSPITAL IN CHULA VISTA TO BECOME PART OF SHARP NETWORK   
text:   Community Hospital of Chula Vista announced Wednesday that it will become a  part of the Sharp HealthCare network -- an affiliation that hospital  administrators say will allow them to expand in anticipation of a future  population boom in the South Bay.    "There is no outright purchase of the hospital by Sharp," said Community  Hospital spokeswoman Imozelle McVeigh. "We are becoming a member of the Sharp  health care system."    But, according to a Community Hospital source who declined to be named, the  agreement calls for Sharp HealthCare -- also known as the San Diego Hospital  Assn. -- to ultimately take ownership of the hospital.      Hospital Debt Targeted    On Wednesday, hospital administrators would say only that Sharp HealthCare and  the hospital will work together to restructure the facility's existing bond  indebtedness. The outstanding indebtedness remaining from the construction of  the main hospital in 1975 and the more recent construction of a convalescent  center is between $10 million and $15 million, McVeigh said.    "Our board has been looking at the whole idea of a corporate affiliation for  about a year," she said. "We could have done some expansion on our own, but  nothing of this magnitude. We're a small community hospital and simply don't  have those financial resources."    An 85-bed expansion is already in the planning stage for the 45-year-old  hospital, which has been in its present location on Medical Center Court in  Chula Vista since 1975. There are 131 beds in the main hospital, plus 98 beds  in the adjacent Birch Patrick Convalescent Center, which opened in 1985.    The planned 90,000-square-foot expansion will include a 23-bed maternity unit,  which is seen as a key move to providing adequate service to the growing number  of young families in the eastern Chula Vista and Otay Mesa areas, McVeigh said.  In addition, an 8-bed surgical intensive care unit, a 54-bed medical-surgical  floor and expanded space for radiology, lab and emergency departments are  planned.    McVeigh said the hospital will retain its "local identity" despite the  acquisition by Sharp. According to the terms of the agreement, Community  Hospital will keep its existing management staff and board of directors.    Community Hospital officials said the decision to join Sharp was not prompted  by financial troubles, and they cited higher-than-average occupancy rates in  the last year.      'Strong Financial Position'    "We are in a strong financial position today, and we expect to be in a strong  financial position in the future," Community Hospital executive director Robert  D. Hansen said in a prepared statement.    "This move is a way for us to join with Sharp to prepare for the future and  expand our services to meet the growing needs of the South Bay community,"  Hansen said.    Peter K. Ellsworth, president and chief executive officer of Sharp HealthCare,  also issued a prepared statement: "In our rapidly changing, competitive health  care environment, the joining of like-minded institutions is important in  allowing them to do the very best for the communities they serve."    Sharp HealthCare's wholly-owned subsidiaries include Sharp Memorial Hospital,  Sharp Cabrillo Hospital, two Sharp Senior HealthCare centers, nine Sharp  Rees-Stealy medical centers, two convalescent hospitals and a preventive  medicine center.    The system boasts San Diego's only state-approved heart transplant center, the  first local open-heart surgery center and the only facility on the West Coast  authorized to give patients artificial hearts.    But the health network -- along with other hospitals in the county -- has  recently run into financial difficulties. Last July, Sharp laid off 44 of its  2,200 employees. The cutback was brought about in part by lower payment rates  from both private insurers and government programs such as Medicare and  Medi-Cal, hospital administrators said.    However, Sharp HealthCare officials say their financial woes are no worse than  other hospitals in the county, most of which have also been stung by lower  insurance payments.

headline:   HUDSON FEARED DISCOVERY BY NANCY REAGAN   
text:   A former bartender who is suing Rock Hudson's estate testified Wednesday that  the actor once refused to take him to a state dinner at the White House because  he was afraid First Lady Nancy Reagan would realize he was homosexual.    "He said that Nancy Reagan would figure out our relationship because she was a  very bright woman and he was embarrassed," Marc Christian said under  cross-examination by Robert Parker Mills, an attorney for Hudson's estate.    Christian, in his third day on the stand in the Los Angeles Superior Court  trial, said he had sex with Hudson about 160 times between June, 1984, when  Hudson learned he had AIDS, and February, 1985, when Christian said he learned  of the actor's illness from a television newscast.      Question Asked    Asked by Mills if he would have stopped having sex with Hudson if he had known  the actor had AIDS, Christian answered, "Yes."    Christian is suing Hudson's estate, two doctors and Mark Miller, the actor's  personal secretary, for $14 million, charging that they conspired to conceal  that Hudson had acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    In a countersuit, estate attorneys claim that Christian was a prostitute who  blackmailed the former leading man by threatening to expose Hudson's  homosexuality.    Hudson died in 1985 of complications from AIDS at the age of 59.    Christian has tested negative for the AIDS virus, but under questioning from  Mills he noted, "There is no test to tell if AIDS is dormant. If there were,  there'd be a lot of relieved people."    The testimony was marked by sharp exchanges between Mills and Christian's  attorney, Harold Rhoden, centering on the admissibility of various depositions  in the case.    At one point, after Mills had taken a document from Rhoden to show Christian,  Rhoden exploded: "Counsel, you grab something from me gently or don't grab it  at all. Don't grab anything from me again."    Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert also admonished Mills and Miller for  "snickering" during Christian's testimony. The admonishment came after  Christian, contradicting testimony he gave last week, said one of his sexual  encounters with Hudson was witnessed by a friend.      Earlier Testimony    Christian said the friend accidentally saw Christian and Hudson having sex and  volunteered the information after his earlier testimony.    "I asked him what he saw, and he said, 'You weren't playing Scrabble,' "  Christian said.    Christian, who met Hudson in 1982 at a fund-raiser for senatorial candidate and  author Gore Vidal, has testified that he had sex with Hudson three to five  times a week.    He contends that because news of Hudson's illness was kept from him, his  chances of being infected by the actor were greatly increased.

headline:   DOTTED LINE LEADS D.A.S INTO TROUBLE   
text:   Somewhere in Contract Law 101 -- maybe in the first hour of the first session  -- students are advised: Don't sign a contract unless you've read it -- much  less the signature page of a contract if there's no contract attached to it.    Attorneys, of course, know this.    Well, most attorneys.    The Deputy District Attorney Assn., the employee bargaining group that  represents virtually all of the county's 200 prosecutors, made that very error  when signing, in December, 1986, what it assumed would be the terms of a salary  and benefits contract between its members and San Diego County.    What the deputy district attorneys' negotiators -- attorneys themselves --  signed was the signature page of a contract, even though the contract itself  was not attached.      'We Trusted Them'    "We trusted them," Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Rooten said of the negotiators who,  he said, were to put the verbal terms of the contract into writing and later  attach the document to the pre-signed signature page. "We agreed in principle  on the language. The county (negotiators) were to prepare the final document."    Signing what was essentially a blank page, Rooten said, was done to meet  deadlines so the contract could be approved by the County Board of Supervisors  in time to implement a pay raise. The contract was to cover the period from  June, 1986, to December, 1988.    But, when the final, written contract was returned to the Deputy District  Attorney Assn., the attorneys cried foul, claiming that some of the terms  didn't reflect what they thought were the terms to which they verbally agreed.    Among other issues, the prosecutors thought they and the county had agreed to  return to the bargaining table in 1987 to negotiate salaries for 1988; the  final version, as written by county negotiators, called for the Board of  Supervisors to unilaterally set the salary table, based on a survey of what  other prosecutors are paid in California. Other differences involved health  benefits and the retirement plan.    The prosecutors sued the county for declaratory relief, asking that the written  contract be rewritten to better reflect what were believed to be the verbal  agreements.      Ruled for Prosecutors    The lawsuit finally went to trial last week, and Superior Court Judge James  Milliken ruled for the prosecutors after three days of testimony by ordering  certain parts of the contract rewritten -- allowing, among other things, for  the two sides to negotiate salaries retroactively for 1988.    The county counsel's office, acting as the attorney for the county's  negotiators, sees the overall issue somewhat differently.    Deputy County Counsel Laurel Gallaher-Tobar said a draft of the contract was  available when the deputy district attorneys signed the blank signature page  memorializing the agreement.    "We argued to the judge that the D.A. association should be held to the  contract, since they had an opportunity to see it," she said. "I thought that  was a major issue. The court didn't agree with me."    So it's back to the negotiating table to resolve issues of salary raises and  health benefits that remained unresolved during 1988.    Meanwhile, negotiations on a 1989 contract are already at an impasse, and Judge  Milliken told both sides he will be available for any more problems.    "And you can bet," Rooten said, "we won't be signing any blank signature pages  this time."

headline:   POLICE COMMISSION URGES COUNCIL TO ACCEPT;    L.A. OFFERED FREE EQUIPMENT FOR TRACKING STOLEN CARS   
text:   An innovative stolen car tracking system that state legislators refused to  approve for Los Angeles last year could be in place by the end of the year  under a plan approved by city police commissioners.    The Los Angeles Police Commission recommended Tuesday that the City Council  agree to a proposed contract under which LoJack Corp. would lease patented,  high-tech equipment to the city for five years at no charge and then transfer  ownership to the city, officials said. The agreement would amount to a gift of  the $1.4-million system to the city.    If approved by the council, any Los Angeles driver could buy and install a $600  transmitter that could be tracked by police computers if the vehicle were  stolen. Police helicopters and about 300 patrol cars would be equipped with the  small tracking computers.    The system, which police officials said could be expanded statewide, is modeled  after one begun in Massachusetts in 1986. That system has led to recovery of  98% of LoJack-equipped cars in an average of 90 minutes, Massachusetts state  police said.      Promise to Buyers    LoJack sells transmitters to Massachusetts drivers with a promise that the cost  will be refunded if the car is stolen and not recovered within 24 hours. As of  August, 12,000 cars were participating in that statewide system.    A California bill last year that would have allocated $1 million to establish a  Stolen Car Recovery Network pilot program in Los Angeles County was dropped  amid criticism that it was tailor-made to give LoJack, of Braintree, Mass., a  monopoly.    The proposal, by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), was dropped after an intense  lobbying effort by other car security companies. None of those companies has  similar technology but they say they could develop similar equipment in less  than a year.    The Police Commission's 5-0 vote prompted at least one of those competitors to  cry foul Wednesday.    "It looks like they are trying to go through the back door with what they  couldn't go through the front door with," said Carolyn Drori, an attorney  representing Clifford Electronics, a Chatsworth firm that was one of several  auto security companies that opposed the LoJack proposal.    Drori said the opponents fear that establishing the LoJack system will lock  them out. "We don't want to stop the LAPD if they think this is an important  tool," Drori said. "But let's make sure it is the best system and an open  system."    LoJack officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday.    The proposed LoJack contract is non-exclusive, meaning the Police Department  could use any equipment developed by competing firms that works better or could  support LoJack equipment, said Sgt. Jeff Hulet, the department's technical  coordinator of the tracking system.    While much of the LoJack equipment is patented, the radio frequency used in the  system is a public frequency. This might allow LoJack competitors to develop  equipment for the system.    Under the proposal, Hulet said, LoJack would enter into the contract with the  city, which would then be empowered to share the equipment with the Sheriff's  Department. Computer bases for the system would likely be located at both  departments and at the state Department of Justice, he said.    Hulet said there are no regulations preventing the city from accepting the free  equipment if the council decides it is in the city's best interest. Because it  is free, there is no need to put the contract out for competitive bidding, he  added.    "It's a moot point," Hulet said. "How do you propose getting it for better than  free?"    The City Council is scheduled to consider the proposal in four to six weeks,  said Officer Bill Farrar of the Police Department's evaluation unit, which  began studying the system nearly two years ago.

headline:   SANTA CLARITA VALLEY;    JUDGE MAY DISMISS 2 SCHOOL FUNDING SUITS   
text:   A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Wednesday appeared to be leaning toward  dismissing two lawsuits filed by crowded Santa Clarita Valley school districts  to block two housing developments until funding is found to build new schools.    Judge Kurt J. Lewin said he would consider Los Angeles County's motion to drop  the suits. "In my opinion, what this is really all about is the imposition of  fees" on developers, he said.    Lewin called the lawsuits an attempt to circumvent a state law on school  financing. An appellate court last month held that the law sets limits of $1.50  per square foot on the amount school districts can charge housing developers  for school construction.      Schools Attorney    Wendy Wiles, attorney for the William S. Hart and Saugus school districts,  argued that the lawsuits are not asking the county to impose fees to pay for  schools and, as such, should not be tied to the appellate court ruling.    The school districts simply are asking that the projects, which include more  than 3,000 homes, apartments and condominiums, be postponed until funding is  obtained, she said.    Because the developments were approved without considering schools, Wiles said,  the districts maintain that the housing projects do not comply with a  sophisticated development-monitoring system adopted by the county in 1987. The  system, or the DMS, was the result of a 12-year lawsuit brought by slow-growth  groups against the county.    The DMS prohibits the county from approving residential projects that will  overburden the school system, she said.    Darlene Phillips, a county attorney, argued that the state school financing  law, enacted in 1987, clearly preempts imposition of fees by the county on  developers to pay for school construction under the DMS. County Counsel Dewitt  W. Clinton agreed in an opinion issued earlier this month.      Will Seek Transfer    Wiles said she will ask that the case be transferred to Judge Norman L.  Epstein, who presided over the last two years of the DMS lawsuit.    Phillips said after the hearing that to remove the case from Lewin's court  would amount to "a slap in the face of Judge Lewin." Lewin, however, said he  "would be happy to have Judge Epstein" hear the lawsuit if the school districts  wish.    Phillips said she doubts that the county would attempt to block the school  districts' efforts to have the case transferred to Epstein.    "I'm not surprised that a decision was not rendered" Wednesday, said Clyde  Smyth, superintendent of the Hart district. "It's an incredibly complicated  issue."    The three high schools in that district will be over capacity by a total of  almost 2,000 students by 1992, Smyth said. He added that based on county  population projections for the year 2010 in the fast-growing valley, the five  area school districts will need $400 million to allow doubling their student  enrollment to more than 40,000.    The valley's population is expected to increase from its current 120,000 to an  estimated 270,000 by 2010 because of rapid housing construction.

headline:   PROJECT CRITICIZED FOR LACK OF CLASS   
text:   About 50 Agoura area residents have told developers that a proposed 474-acre  commercial and residential project is too dense and not classy enough for their  semi-rural community.    Wickliff &amp; Co. and the Pulte Home Corp. want to build 338 housing units and  261,700 square feet of commercial space, including a discount retail store,  near Agoura and Kanan roads. They are calling the proposal the Agoura Canyon  Ranch.    In a town hall-style meeting in Agoura Hills punctuated by shouting Tuesday  night, residents said the proposal would clog traffic on already busy roads.  The proposal includes 126 condominiums, which some residents said would be out  of character with the community of large estate homes to the south. Others  objected to the discount store.    The project is "low-end rather than upper-end," resident Michael Genthe said.  "You're proposing such a non-consistent development compared to what's there  today."    "We don't need it, and we don't want it," resident Gary Epper said.    Developers' representatives defended the proposal, saying that the discount  store would serve the community and that the condominiums would satisfy  requirements for low-cost housing.    "We're not proposing a cheap-production thing," said Robert W. Smith, vice  president of Pulte Home. "These can be fairly expensive things that will add to  the value of the community." The project would include 80 estate-sized houses  on lots averaging two acres.    In addition, the developers said, the city of Agoura Hills would receive $3.3  million in fees for traffic improvements.    The city could use that money to pay for new on- and off-ramps to the eastbound  Ventura Freeway at Kanan Road, estimated to cost $2.9 million, City Manager  David N. Carmany said.    The site of the proposed project straddles the southern border of Agoura Hills,  with the area proposed for houses and condominiums in unincorporated Los  Angeles County territory.    If the city were to annex the unincorporated area, Wickliff and Pulte would  have to seek zoning changes to permit the housing density they are proposing,  Carmany said.    Project officials said they did not know how much housing is allowed under the  county plan for the area.    Robert L. Anderson, Wickliff vice president, promised to hold another meeting  in about a month to respond to those and other questions, such as the issue of  possible flooding from Medea Creek.

Among the conditions of Richard Vander's probation are that he enter a  drug-treatment program and pay a fine of $200. He was sentenced Tuesday by  Vista Superior Court Judge Richard Mudd.    Vander, 37, had operated the Solana Beach nightclub for adults and was seeking  to reestablish it as an alcohol-free teen-age club when he was arrested in  November, 1987. The club remains vacant.    In exchange for his guilty plea to possession of cocaine, prosecutors dropped  their charge that he was an ex-felon illegally in possession of a handgun.    The arrest came when sheriff's detectives, saying they wanted to discuss using  Vander as an informant, met with him in his office and detected what they  believed was cocaine in his office.

headline:   USIU TO DROP WOMEN'S BASKETBALL   
text:   U.S. International University will drop its women's basketball program,  effective at the end of this season, Coach Cassie Macias said Wednesday night.    Women's basketball is the second major sport that USIU has dropped within the  past year, having eliminated men's hockey after last season. The athletic  department now has the minimum number of sports -- six each for men and women  -- required to remain in National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I.    Macias said she had notified Athletic Director Al Palmiotto that she intended  to resign after the season to pursue other interests. But they decided not to  announce her resignation until the end of the season.    "It was very coincidental that it happened the same year," Macias said. "One of  my first questions was, 'Was this because I've resigned?' and Dr. Palmiotto  said, 'No, they didn't even know about it.'    "They did research into what direction they wanted to go early in the year and  they told us to stop scheduling and recruiting for all the programs until they  made a decision," Macias said. "They then decided they would stay Division I."    But not without some sacrifice.    "Obviously, we are the most expensive female sport, " Macias said.    Women's basketball is fully funded at USIU with 15 full-ride scholarship, the  maximum allowed by the NCAA. USIU's 11 players -- 7 seniors, 1 junior and 3  freshmen -- will be allowed to transfer without losing a year of eligibility.    Macias, in her sixth year at USIU, was the school's first full-time women's  basketball coach.She started the season with an 85-54 career record, including  a West Coast Athletic Conference championship and a berth in the Women's  National Invitation Tournament in the 1985-86 season. The Gulls were 24-9 that  season.    USIU is 4-12 this season and left this morning for a 3-game trip to Utah,  Wyoming and Northern Arizona.    USIU finished second in the WCAC in 1986-87, but the school was dropped from  the conference after the season when the conference aligned its women's  programs with the men's.    Other that those 2 seasons, USIU has been an independent since turning Division  I in 1979.    "It's unfortunate but with the changes coming down it would be hard to maintain  a certain level of success that we've become accustomed too," said Macias, who  was an assistant at Northeast Louisiana before coming to USIU. "The scheduling  was getting very, very tough. We had to travel a lot this year and next year we  were finding that we would have to travel a lot again.    "I have to feel good about what happened the last 6 years. With all the  obstacles and challenges we faced, we accomplished a lot."

headline:   FREE-THROW LINE OFFERS NO CHARITY TO MEN'S TEAMS   
text:   The men's basketball coaches and players at San Diego State, the University of  San Diego and U.S. International might be pained to read the numbers in the  Guinness Book of World Records:     -- On June 25, 1977, Ted St. Martin of Jacksonville, Fla., made 2,036 free  throws in a row.     -- Fred Newman of San Jose made 88 consecutive free throws blindfolded and 338  of 356 (94.9%) in 10 minutes.     -- In 24 hours, Jeff Liles made 15,138 of 17,862 (84.7%).    Last year, UC San Diego's Rob Rittgers set NCAA Division III records for most  and consecutive free throws in a game when he made 30 of 30, including 24  successive technical foul shots, against Menlo College.    And 2-year-old Hank Martin of Cincinnati once made -- with a smaller ball and  basket -- 2 of 6 shots on "Late Night with David Letterman."    Worth one point, a free throw is like a 2-foot putt in golf, a  fourth-and-inches situation in football or a second serve in tennis. It is  expected to be made, a routine action that draws the most attention when  missed. This target is 15 feet away and 10 feet high, and nobody is allowed  directly in front or within 5 feet of the shooter.    The free throw. Even its name implies ease.    But for San Diego's three NCAA Division I men's teams, the free throw has been  costly in 1988-89. The percentages are .629 at SDSU, .605 at USIU and .600 at  USD. Each can attribute at least two losses to bad days at the so-called  "charity stripe."    And while the local Division I men's teams have wallowed around 60% at the  line, the women's teams at each school are near 70% or better: SDSU is shooting  74.5%, USD 72.2% and USIU 69.5%.    Behind the statistics have been some dubious occurrences for the men and  terrific distinctions for the women.    With a sprained thumb, Dana Jackson, a 38% free-throw shooter for SDSU, shot  two air balls in a row at Utah. USIU has had two shots -- one by Steve Smith  (72%), the other by Willie Davis (56%) -- hit nothing but air. Another USIU  player, Tim Moore (30%), missed so wildly that the ball caromed back to him off  the rubber bottom of the backboard. Mike Sterner, USIU's 6-foot 11-inch center,  is shooting just 27% from the line.    USD has been the most troubled, losing five games by five points or less. In  each, poor free-throw shooting, especially down the stretch, was costly. The  top free-throw shooter on the team, Wayman Strickland, is making 76%. Sophomore  center Dondi Bell has improved somewhat this season, from 50% to 57%, with a  new 1-handed style.    USD women Candida Echeverria and Paula Mascari are making 87% and 81%,  respectively, of their free throws.    For SDSU's women, the lowest percentage of the starters is freshman Crystal Lee  at .739. Center Chana Perry has made 77% (78 of 101), Stefanie Massie 80% and  Brooke Meadows 84%. Julie Evans has missed only 1 in 25 attempts (96%). For the  men, Tony Ross (87.5%) is the only player above 80%. Only seven others are  above 70%. One is Sam Johnson, who has improved from 49% last year to 78% this  season.    USIU has only three women's players (one injured, two reserves) below 67%. The  men's team has eight.    "It's supposed to be a free shot," said Aztec center Mitch McMullen, a 50%  free-throw shooter. "There's no excuse. Shame on us if we don't make it."    So why the trend at each school? Could it be that women are better free throw  shooters in general? Did Nostradamus predict the wrong shake-up?    Jim Brandenburg, SDSU's men's coach, said, "I think women, in general, have  better pairs of hands than men. To catch, to pass, to do a lot of different  dexterous-type things.    "I'm not sure that I could statistically prove it. But from my observation of  30 years of coaching, women can probably outshoot the men within certain  ranges."    Kathy Marpe, USD's women's coach, said, "Women have a more sensitive feel for  the ball. And they tend to have more patience."    On Jan. 25, 1986, Marpe's USD team set an NCAA record for free-throw shooting  percentage in a game by making 24 of 24.    "I think women may have a better mental attitude than men," says USIU men's  Coach Gary Zarecky. "Everything I've read is that women handle stress better  than men."    It's all true, says Mike Brum, an SDSU graduate student who works with the  men's and women's players as a sports psychologist consultant.    "It's been proven, women have a tendency to have greater control over fine  muscle movement than men do," Brum said. "And they have a built-in system of  handling stress because their bodies are prepared to bear children. They are  better able to handle fine motor movements in stressful situations."    Brum adds that free throw shooting is different from the rest of the game  because you use different motor movements at the line. "I teach relaxation,  focusing and key words in a process called backward shaping," he said.    Brum said backward shaping is a method of going through and learning the  fundamental movements in reverse order to eliminate errors and bad habits.    It all sounds very psychological, but SDSU women's Coach Earnest Riggins says,  simply, "Free-throw shooting is mental discipline and concentration."    Poor free-throw shooting, said Brandenburg, "Is kind of like being an  alcoholic. You'll never beat it until you can say, 'Yes, I'm an alcoholic.' "    What happens, Brandenburg said, "is it really becomes a psychological thing  with a lot of players. Players that have high anxiety levels, players that are  hyper and really want to please, those guys will get up there on that foul line  and their heart comes right up in their throat. You can work on free throws and  work on free throws, but sometimes you have good free-throw shooting teams and  sometimes you don't."    Brandenburg said players also tend to see free throws as an unglamorous aspect  of the game.    "In today's basketball, you will find very few players that see themselves as  steady free-throw shooters," he said. "I don't think they picture themselves as  great free-throw shooters. Those guys are in the minority. Nobody reacts to two  silky smooth free throws. All the guys are jumping and dunking. So that's what  young players react to. That's what gets the crowd going."    Zarecky said that when he was teaching a clinic in Yugoslavia, the European  players did not want to hear about shooting because they felt they were already  better shooters than Americans. They wanted to learn about fast breaks and  fancy passes, because that's what Americans were noted for.    Said USD Coach Hank Egan, "The men's game has become a lot more athletic. And  maybe we're recruiting that way. Free-throw shooting is a skill function.  Athleticism has nothing to do with free-throw shooting. Jumping and speed don't  matter. It's a lot like hitting a golf ball. It's a lot of muscle familiarity.    "Larry Bird (one of the NBA's best free-throw shooters) is not an athlete. He  is the consummate skill player. He has overcome the lack of running and jumping  ability with a tremendous amount of skill."    For all the analysis, some of the local men's players just might be suffering  from an affliction for which there is no cure.    Lincoln High School Coach Ron Loneski was a teammate of Wilt Chamberlain's at  the University of Kansas.    "I played with the worst shooter in the world," he said, "and nobody had an  answer for him."

headline:   MAYOR BRADLEY SNUBS MOLINA, BACKS TORRES IN SUPERVISOR RACE   
text:   Snubbing a City Hall colleague, Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday endorsed state  Sen. Art Torres for Los Angeles County supervisor from a field of nine  candidates that includes Councilwoman Gloria Molina.    Torres' campaign advisers said the endorsement would carry weight not only in  Los Angeles city neighborhoods that make up about one-fourth of the new 1st  District, but in other communities as well.    "There are a lot of people who don't live in the city who think Tom Bradley is  their mayor," said Dee Dee Myers, spokeswoman for Torres, a Los Angeles  Democrat.    Molina sought to turn Bradley's support of Torres to her advantage.    "Tom Bradley demands an absolute kind of loyalty, and that is something I don't  provide to anyone," she said. "I have enjoyed my independence on the council."    Molina said she did not seek Bradley's endorsement, but conceded that it would  help Torres. The councilwoman questioned the extent of the help, contending  that the mayor's popularity has declined because of his political problems.    Torres said the mayor's endorsement "means that I can get along with people at  every level of government."    Molina and Torres are seeking to become the county's first Latino supervisor  this century in the Jan. 22 election. Other candidates include state Sen.  Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) and Sarah Flores, a former aide to Supervisor  Pete Schabarum. The new district was carved out by a federal judge who ruled  that the old district lines denied the county's 3 million Latinos political  representation.    Bradley said his endorsement came as the result of a long friendship with  Torres.    "He and I have been friends and mutual supporters," the mayor said. "I've known  him for almost as long as I've been in politics. I admire him for his vision  and for his courage and for his creativity. . . . I believe that he will bring  to the board progressive, forward-thinking ideas and the ability to make  friends and to work together with the city."    Asked about Molina, Bradley said: "I'm here to support Art Torres, not to talk  in a negative fashion about any other candidate."    The other major candidates downplayed the endorsement.    Flores issued a press release listing her endorsements from 58 mayors and city  council members within the new 1st District.    Calderon said: "I never sought Bradley's endorsement because I don't believe  it's important. . . . It puts Art Torres in an interesting position. He has  taken a strong stance criticizing the city of Los Angeles for dumping over 70%  of its garbage in the San Gabriel Valley and then he turns around and goes to  get the endorsement of its chief."    Torres responded: "You're going to have sour grapes from any candidate who  doesn't receive the support of Tom Bradley. . . . The people in the San Gabriel  Valley know and respect Tom Bradley. The people in Los Angeles know and respect  Tom Bradley."

headline:   UCSD DOCTOR DEFENDS ADVICE TO MEXICANS;    MEDICINE: A PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGIST CALLS A STATE INVESTIGATION A 'WITCH HUNT'  AND SAYS THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH TELLING THE PARENTS OF ILL CHILDREN ABOUT  BETTER MEDICAL CARE ACROSS THE BORDER.   
text:   A UC San Diego physician being investigated by the state for allegedly coaching  the parents of Mexican children on how to qualify for free health care in the  United States insisted Tuesday that she was in no way guilty of wrongdoing.    Dr. Lilliam M. Valdes-Cruz, a pediatric cardiologist at UCSD who sees patients  in university-run clinics in Tijuana and Mexicali, acknowledged in an interview  in the office of her attorney that she occasionally tells parents where better  care can be obtained.    "But I don't help them get across," she said insistently, adding that she feels  a medical obligation to inform parents of a better, safer alternative,  particularly if a child's heart condition is serious.    "Sometimes, I have told them that better care would be available in hospitals  in Mexico City and San Diego, but if they come here (San Diego), they do so of  their own accord," she said. "It isn't something I facilitate."    In October, UCSD's center of pediatric cardiology became the focus of a  controversy, in which state officials began investigating reports that medical  care for as many as 100 children who suffer from heart problems was being  illegally funded through Medi-Cal.    Officials from the State Department of Health Services believe UCSD Medical  Center may have improperly billed the state for at least $1 million. State  investigators believe the children were first seen at a Tijuana clinic where  UCSD doctors volunteer.    State authorities allege that UCSD doctors aided parents of the children by  helping them obtain letters for U.S. immigration officials, certifying that the  children would be treated at UCSD without taxpayer expense.    State investigators charged that UCSD officials impeded their investigation by  initially blocking attempts to interview staff members and not making key  documents available to them. The documents were not available to investigators  until subpoenas were delivered for them.    Most of the cases identified by state investigators involve poor children who  might otherwise never have had access to American health care. But one case  being investigated is that of the infant son of a Mexican cattle rancher who is  thought to own thousands of acres, according to state investigators.    Gerald Blank, the attorney for Valdes-Cruz, said Tuesday that several patients  had been guilty of wrongdoing in falsifying applications -- by, for instance,  listing as their own the addresses of relatives living in California -- but it  was not something that doctors helped them with.    Blank said it was his suspicion that some patients may have attempted to blame  doctors, once state authorities began to question them.    Asked if she were part of a "network" that aided Mexican children, poor or  otherwise, in obtaining medical care in the United States, Valdes-Cruz said,  "There is no network . . . certainly that I've been involved in."    In addition to Valdes-Cruz, the state also is investigating Dr. Azucena Murillo  and a hospital secretary, Mercedes A. Alvarado. Murillo, who is not licensed to  practice in the United States, worked as a research associate in pediatric  cardiology at UCSD Medical Center.    In the wake of the Medi-Cal allegations and the death of a 3-year-old Tijuana  boy at the hospital in July, state authorities say Murillo is being  investigated for practicing medicine without a license.    According to a coroner's autopsy, the boy died of a "drug-related accident,"  after being given a sedative drawn into an oral syringe by Murillo. The boy  died soon after being given the sedative by his mother.    As an outgrowth of the continuing investigations, Dr. David Sahn was removed as  head of the pediatric cardiology division late last month. Sahn was replaced by  Dr. Kyung Chung, who was named acting head of the division.    UCSD officials have said they are conducting their own inquiries, independent  of the state, into allegations of both bogus Medi-Cal payments and the death of  the boy.    "When they come to me, I don't know whether a person has the resources to pay  or not," Valdes-Cruz said Tuesday. "I don't ask them; that's not my job. That  is determined by whoever determines whether a person can qualify for state care  for indigent or low-income people.    "I literally don't know the nature of employment of three quarters of the  parents of the patients I see."    Asked if she knew their insurance mechanism, Valdes-Cruz said, "Hardly ever.  That is not something I get concerned with. I don't know any physicians who do.  It's a piece of information we take for granted . . . that's happening  elsewhere.    "We don't particularly pay attention to it. We are not in a private  institution. We help people of all sorts, from the rich to the poorest of the  poor. I don't think it makes any difference to most of the people at UCSD. And  it is not something I inquire about."    Valdes-Cruz said many of her patients often travel back and forth between the  United States and Mexico.    "It surprises me that people are amazed by things like this happening in a  border town," she said, explaining how easily people move from one country to  the other.    "And, in one sense, it disturbs me. I now see a witch hunt surrounding patients  with Hispanic surnames."    Valdes-Cruz said the so-called witch hunt had gotten much worse since the  allegations surfaced. But, despite the allegations, she reiterated that she has  done nothing wrong and pointed a finger at no one else.    "I don't think any wrong was committed here, by anybody," she said. "I don't  see any impropriety . . . at any point."

headline:   HOSTAGE STANDOFF ENDS AT PRISON AFTER 17 HOURS;    MCC: FEDERAL AGENTS STORM CELL WHERE PAIR OF INMATES HELD A GUARD CAPTIVE,  THREATENING TO KILL HIM WITH A KNIFE THEY MADE.   
text:   A heavily armed FBI SWAT team stormed a cell at the Metropolitan Correctional  Center in downtown San Diego on Tuesday, ending a nearly 17-hour standoff with  two inmates who had taken a prison guard hostage in their cell.    The guard, Donnie Houston, 29, was examined at UC San Diego Medical Center,  where doctors found that he had suffered "seemingly no injuries at all," a  hospital spokeswoman said.    A second guard, Robert Gibson, 29, suffered minor injuries while escaping from  the cell shortly after the inmates overpowered the guards about 9 p.m. Monday,  prison spokesman Gavin O'Connor said.    The inmates were taken into custody at 1:40 p.m. Tuesday, O'Connor said.    "Staff is looking into the way the situation concluded," he said. "They have to  get written statements from the FBI and all staff involved."    O'Connor said he did not expect the report to be available until this morning.    It was the first hostage-taking incident at the federal prison since it opened  15 years ago, O'Connor said.    The inmates had demanded access to the media to talk about living conditions in  their cells, said Sheldon Sherman, the attorney for one of the men. They also  wanted to make a bargain with the U.S. attorney in which Rodriguez would  receive credit for time served and be freed in exchange for Houston's release.  None of the demands were met.    Ernest Olivo Cruz and Jose Rodriguez, both originally from Cuba, held Houston  hostage in the cell they shared in a high-security area of the 12-story prison,  O'Connor said. They had apparently fashioned a knife-like weapon from furniture  in the cell. No details were available about how the inmates overcame the two  guards or how Gibson escaped.    Cruz previously escaped from prison in Florida, where he was serving two life  sentences, O'Connor said. Cruz and Rodriguez, both 32, were being held at MCC  on drug-related charges.    A federal agent who had arrested the pair during a drug sting in San Diego  recognized Cruz in October while watching a television program about unsolved  crimes, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent in San Diego told The  Times last month. Fingerprint checks confirmed that Cruz was actually Emilio  Bravo, who had escaped from prison in Dade County, Fla.    Cruz pleaded guilty to charges of trying to rob federal agents in the sting and  was awaiting sentencing. Rodriguez was awaiting trial on the charge, O'Connor  said.    SWAT team members stormed the cell after Houston started screaming, said  Sherman, who was representing Rodriguez on the drug charges. Sherman and  federal public defender David Cohen, who represented Cruz, were called in about  10 p.m. Monday after the inmates refused to continue negotiating with the FBI  and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Sherman said.    Houston was bound at the hands and feet and was sitting in a corner of the  cell, Sherman said. The inmates repeatedly threatened to kill him as 30 SWAT  officers stood just out of sight with automatic rifles poised.    Cells in the high-security area on the fifth floor are "specially equipped to  restrict movement of the inmates," O'Connor said. "Only one cell is allowed out  at a time. The area they are allowed out into is small."    The inmates complained that they were mistreated by guards, let out of their  cells only one hour a day and severely restricted in their ability to make  phone calls or have visitors, Sherman said.    According to Sherman, a staff psychologist wrote a letter to prison authorities  warning that Rodriguez was becoming mentally ill because of conditions at the  prison and recommended sending him to Lompoc prison's high-security ward, where  he would be afforded more freedom.    Rodriguez was shuffled between Lompoc and the MCC, brought to San Diego for  court appearances, and had been at MCC for a few days before the hostage  scenario unfolded, Sherman said.

headline:   ARRESTS IN TIJUANA DEATHS CONFIRMED   
text:   Tijuana officials confirmed Tuesday that three people are in custody in  connection with the carbon monoxide poisoning deaths last week of 12 people in  a house during a religious ceremony.    But Mexican officials said they have not asked the FBI for help in finding two  people described as Americans who allegedly were at the ritual, denying a  report carried by the Mexican news agency Excelsior.    The three people in custody are being held on charges of abandonment because  they allegedly failed to call authorities when they discovered 18 people lying  unconscious in the house. Six survived.    The three -- Ana Fabiola Miranda Juarez, 19; Gerardo Barrios Rodriguez, 20, and  Estela Jimenez Ceballos, 46 -- were all arrested Thursday, the day the bodies  were found.    Last week, authorities said they were questioning Miranda, but Tuesday was the  first time they disclosed that all three are in custody and under  investigation.    It will now be up to the Tijuana district attorney's office to determine  whether any of the three have any responsibility in the deaths, said Jaime Sam  Fierro, commander of the Baja California Judicial Police in Tijuana.    Miranda had gone to the house about 7 a.m. Thursday to look for her mother,  Gloria Miranda Juarez, who owned the house in the Colonia Mariano Matamoros on  the southeastern outskirts of the city.    According to authorities, the younger Miranda found the people in the house  unconscious, with the exception of an 8-month-old girl, Ana Karen Osuna, who  was crying.    Rather than calling police or emergency medical assistance, she allegedly went  to see Barrios Rodriguez, a friend who lives in the Matamoros neighborhood, and  told him what happened.    The two then drove to another nearby neighborhood, Colonia Castillo, to look  for Jimenez Ceballos, whom police described as a "medium." Miranda and Barrios  Rodriguez sought out Jimenez to see if she could provide religious help for the  people at the house.    "They told the woman what had happened instead of letting the authorities  know," Fierro said. "Those persons, having known what had happened, never  called the Red Cross or the police." Police did not elaborate on what the pair  did after seeking out Jimenez.    In Mexico, the Red Cross responds to medical emergencies just as paramedics do  in the United States.    "By knowing what had taken place and not having told anyone, they became  involved in the matter," Fierro said.    As it turned out, Gloria Miranda Juarez and 11 others in the house died of  carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty lamp powered by butane gas, chemical  experts with the judicial police said Monday.    Gloria Miranda Juarez had lived in the house with Federico Padres Mexia, the  leader of the religious group that relied in part on mediums to conduct  elaborate prayer rituals, which included burning sulfur and, in at least some  instances, rubbing their bodies with perfume.    Mexia, along with two others -- Juan Jose Sarabia Estrada and Consuelo Ponce --  remain comatose in Tijuana hospitals.    As for the report that Mexican authorities had asked for the FBI's help, Fierro  denied that such a request was ever made, or that Americans were at the  ill-fated ceremony.    "That is not true. There was no one from the United States there," Fierro said.  "Everyone there was Mexican."    He said the only organization ever contacted for help was the San Diego Police  Department, in order to get help in performing tests on the victims' blood and  tissue. Those tests were eventually done by the San Diego County medical  examiner.    But some relatives of the dead told reporters that two Americans were at the  ritual and were seen leaving the house sometime during the night. But the  relatives said that they did not have a description of the couple and that they  had received their information from people in the neighborhood.

headline:   SKIPPER PERISHES WHEN BOAT CAPSIZES   
text:   One man was killed and another fell into the ocean when a fishing boat headed  for New Zealand capsized Monday about 980 miles southwest of San Diego, a Coast  Guard spokesman said.    The skipper of the Viva, Richard Ennis, 53, of Morro Bay, was lost after he  became trapped aboard the 47-foot boat when it capsized about 1 p.m., said  Timothy Rowe, a Coast Guard spokesman.    Before his death, Ennis warned crewman Terry Groat, 26, of Crescent City to  abandon ship. "Apparently (Groat) was sleeping, and the ship's master went in  and woke him up," Rowe said.    Groat was reportedly thrown from the vessel but rescued by the crew of the  Billie Marie, a fishing vessel traveling with the Viva. Both vessels list Morro  Bay, about 350 miles north of San Diego, as their home port, Rowe said.    The cause of the capsizing is under investigation.

headline:   JUDGE'S SON SENTENCED IN ROBBERIES   
text:   U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam became a spectator in court Tuesday as he  watched his 33-year-old son sentenced to one year in County Jail for robbing  two taxicab drivers.    Earl Kenneth Gilliam was also placed on five years' probation, fined $200 and  ordered to repay cabbie John Plough the $66 stolen from him Aug. 10.    San Diego Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz specified that Gilliam be tested  for drug use every two weeks, attend drug counseling three times a week and  refrain from using public transportation.    The judge said that, if Gilliam violates the terms of his probation, he will go  to prison for as long as 10 years. The sentence will be reviewed April 24.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Garrett Randall had suggested a four-year state prison term.  He said Gilliam had admitted to robbing the drivers to get money to obtain  cocaine.    Gilliam pleaded guilty to robbing Plough and cabdriver Raymond Garcia on Sept.  18. Garcia lost a gold chain that was recovered by police.    Gilliam, who could have received a maximum seven years and four months in  prison, apologized to Plough, saying, "You did not deserve to be treated that  way."    He said he had been up all night using drugs before the 8 a.m. holdup.    "I'm really very ashamed of what I've done," Gilliam said. "I know I'm guilty .  . . and I have some serious problems emotionally. I have drug problems,  depression. One thing I don't want to do is drugs or alcohol anymore."    Judge Gilliam was appointed to the federal bench in 1980 by President Jimmy  Carter and was a Superior Court judge for many years in the 1970s.

headline:   OFFICER FOUND JUSTIFIED IN SHOOTING SUSPECT ARMED WITH 2 GUNS   
text:   The San Diego County district attorney's office has ruled that the San Diego  police shooting of a 22-year-old man was justified because the man was getting  ready to fire a semiautomatic pistol.    Sean Sylvester White, carrying both the pistol and a sawed-off shotgun, was  injured in the September shooting and charged with assault with a firearm on a  peace officer.    His Superior Court trial is set for Feb. 25.    The district attorney's office said White is known to be a member of the West  Coast Crips gang and was on parole for kidnaping after being released in April  from state prison.    The district attorney's office gave this account of the shooting:    Police Officer William Alan Albrektsen spotted White at 2:13 a.m. Sept. 5 and  began following him in his patrol car. White, with an object under his arm,  quickened his pace. Albrektsen thought the man had a gun, got out of the car  and ordered White to stop. White then ran into an apartment building and began  pounding on a door to get inside. Albrektsen followed and told him to put his  hands up and drop what he had under his arm.    Albrektsen said he warned White several times before he saw White "either pull  out his shirt or push up his jacket." Albrektsen said White grabbed a gun out  of his waistband and, when "he started bringing it towards me . . . that's when  I fired."    The district attorney's office ruled that Albrektsen was justified in using  force to protect himself.

To say that I, a 26-year-old white American, am responsible for things done to  long dead black Americans by equally long dead white Americans is an affront to  intelligence.    Brock would have, I suppose, all white Americans have a special tax levied on  them because of their race. This would be done in order to punish white people  for the sins of their race. Is this not the worst sort of racism? Is this not  the same of thinking that Hitler had toward the Jews?    Rather than ever submit to a plan like Brock's, I would die fighting it.

Slaves provided much of labor that formed the foundation upon which this  country was built. The rewards of the labor provided by slaves wound up in the  pockets of the slave owners. Descendants of slave owners have therefore amassed  fortunes from the blood and sweat of African slaves.    How can anyone deny that America has profited from the work of slave labor? The  question is not "Does America owe descendants of former slaves anything?" The  question is "When will America give African-Americans the share of America's  wealth their ancestors have earned?"    Keep up the good work, Mr. Brock. The truth is on your side.

text:   I can no longer ignore my conscience. I have to tell you about Florence. I  first met her 1 1/2 years ago.    Then, she had only been homeless for a couple of months. She reminded me of my  grandmother. I asked for her name and she told me. It was the last time she  ever answered one of my questions. It was also the last time she ever asked me  for money.    Since then I have seen Florence dozens of times on the streets of Hollywood.  Mostly she is curled up in the fetal position, but sometimes I actually see her  walking. All her pores are filled with dirt and her nails are several inches  long and curling around her fingertips. She is constantly talking to characters  that I do not see, though I am sure to her they are very real.    Every time I see Florence I go to her and say hello but she does not answer.  Sometimes she will take money from me though she nevers says anything to me. I  can see in her eyes that she is alive and "in there."    I am sure that I live in the greatest country on Earth and I probably would die  for the causes our Founding Fathers seem to have had. The "bottom line" in my  heart is that I am very ashamed of the way my government has taken care of  Florence.    MAURO OLIVEIRA    Hollywood

headline:   PRIVATE FACES, PUBLIC PLACES;    COSMETIC INTIMACY COLORS A MOST INTIMATE RITUAL   
text:   In the old days in Russia, women began and ended their lives in the bath house.  They went there to give birth; they went there as brides, the day before they  married. And when people died, it was in the baths that women washed the  bodies. The intimacy of tired flesh, of forgiveness and renewal -- where do  women know such closeness now?    In the old days in Russia, Zhanna Khotik was a factory's production manager.  She was a university graduate, a person of position. Her husband was an  engineer, a man of stature who carried himself well. Before she came to  America, she had not thought that her husband would toil here as a construction  worker, or that, in this brave new world, she would end up waxing hair from  legs, bikini lines and armpits.    Her customers like Zhanna: She is large, soft, comforting, old-fashioned as  they themselves have no wish to be. Her long Titian hair is tucked untidily  away in a bun; her smile is broad; she wipes her hands on a fresh apron as if  it were an apple pie that she were tackling, not stubborn hairs to be pulled by  the roots. She remembers what others forget: whose family doesn't talk, whose  father is sick, whose child has nightmares, the small sadnesses that find no  other home.    She has set up her beauty bed, her pot of warm and syrupy wax, in the back room  of a nail parlor on Santa Monica Boulevard. It is a parlor of Russians and  Romanians and the air is alive with the velvet of their language: Adrianna, who  specializes in pedicures; Maggie, plump and cozy in the corner; Gilda, all  glittering drama by the front door -- her husband has done better than most --  and, against the far wall, Virginia, silent and broad, nodding over nails that  are broken, talons created over stubble, coats of invincible lacquer.    The clients' armchairs, deep and club-like, face into the room. They talk  constantly: diets, divorces, the triumph of shopping, with petulance over  stains on silk, of maids who let them down. And while the lacquer sets, they  sink into other chairs, hands twittering, toes curling out from rubber stands  to keep the ruby or the shocking pink from smudging. The talking never ceases;  its intimacy gives no clue as to who is a close friend, who a face glimpsed  today for the first time. The salon hears of the man who cannot commit, the  weekend that soured, the ex-husband who tries not to pay -- neither privacy nor  restraint. The great knowing eyes from Kiev and Bucharest absorb it all.    To Zhanna, locked in the little back room, they relate their lives: operations,  marriages, vacations, and in her kind and equable way, she worries for them.  Somewhere are aunts who are never phoned, mothers rarely seen, grandmothers  long forgotten; Zhanna becomes them all in the hour of half-legs and  under-arms.    She treasures what 11 years in America have brought her: a home in distant  hills, college education for her sons, a car, a holiday once in New York. And  she keeps to herself the sadness for her own mother who died so far away, for  her mother-in-law's present suffering. Each night after work, she drives for  hours to the hospital, grateful to have found one that would take a sick old  woman with the wrong insurance. "You have to be lucky in life," Zhanna says.  "Even in dying, you have to be lucky."    Unspoken sorrows: They are not plump, these Russians and Romanians, because  they do not care -- but because they care too much. They hold up the sky so  that others may walk beneath.    And what of the clients, who drop $19 for a pedicure or a nail fill, $170 for a  handbag, on a whim, from a visiting peddler? How many tip as generously, or  remember to ask about Adrianna's surgery, her aching back, the constant fear of  bad times? Ah, the profligacy of a smile where friendship is not the greatest  gift in our possession.    In the old days in Russia, women began and ended their days in the bath house.  Have we reduced intimacy to the size of a finger nail, the depth of a hair  root?

headline:   PERSPECTIVE ON LEADERSHIP;    WE'RE NOT SEEING MASTER STROKES;    POLITICIANS ACT MOST OFTEN BY SPASM OR WHIM, WITH NO MORE THOUGHT THAN A  MOTORIST FIGHTING HIS WAY HOME ON THE FREEWAY.   
text:   I think it was Gladstone who described his duties as prime minister of Britain  as that of the guy on a raft in a rapids, using a pole to keep the raft from  smashing into the rocks. That is probably history's most honest rendering of  how government actually functions.    Consider the metaphor: The ship of state is referred to as a raft -- the most  unmanageable of watercraft. The person in command does not use a rudder, which  is how you steer a ship. He uses a pole to fend off rocks -- he is reactive  rather than pro-active, trying to avoid disaster rather than trying to steer a  proper course. And the raft is being carried down a rapids -- he has no idea  where he is going but is being swept along by forces he cannot control.    There are two great fictions about life that people in government and, worse,  in the media, treat as gospel. The first is that people in high-government  offices all over the world know what they are doing. The second is that  government officials in crises make brilliant tactical moves.    The Persian Gulf crisis offers itself as an object lesson in how history works  before historians get their chance to change it.    On Aug. 2, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. One may reasonably assume that he  took this action in anticipation of doubling his country's net financial worth  at minimum cost. Earlier discussions with the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad,  unfortunately, reinforced that view. Perhaps he had plans for a further sojourn  south into Saudi Arabia, perhaps not. At the least, he anticipated that he  would be able to dominate Saudi Arabia politically through the overt threat of  military force on its borders, allowing him to maximize the economic benefit of  his oil wealth through market control. If successful, it would have been called  a master stroke.    But there aren't many master strokes in human history. This same Saddam Hussein  10 years ago launched a war of aggression into Iran in hope of achieving a  quick, cheap victory, and that war mutated into an eight-year nightmare --  World War I fought with some of World War III's weapons -- that took the lives  of more than a million people. And after invading Kuwait, Hussein gave back  what little he had gained at the cost of between 2% and 3% of his total  population; this action -- called by some a brilliant maneuver -- was  undertaken to secure his northeastern frontier against a country that would  still probably like to see his head on a pike. Any reasonable analysis will  suggest that the move was one of desperation rather than brilliance.    Hussein's subsequent moves have shown little greater perception. Taking unto  himself thousands of hostages, he tried to give them back in dribs and drabs to  any official or amateur agent who bothered purchasing air fare to Baghdad. He  failed to consider the logic of his own action, and either got carried away and  decided to give them all back, or decided that there was no further use in  holding them. That is, after enraging people all over the world through  kidnaping, he is seeking to garner favor by admitting his crime and returning  his victims. It would have made far more sense not to have taken them, or  having done so, to hold onto them.    One of the reasons given for releasing the hostages is the most laughable of  all: that Hussein was encouraged by resistance among Americans and within  Congress to the President's action. One might speculate that Hussein's  ambassador in Washington -- yet another perceptive individual -- failed to tell  his boss that the President's drop in approval polls more probably reflected  the same waffling on budget matters that hurt Republican congressional  candidates (people do not compartmentalize their views on a person's  competence) and that the drop was already reversing itself anyway. And Congress  will do what it always does in a time of crisis -- that is, it looks concerned  while taking no substantive action, like every other committee in the civilized  world.    Despite all this, we are inundated by news stories -- and their most dreaded  companions, "news analysis" columns -- telling us of the cleverness of  Hussein's political and psychological maneuvering. Those pieces are often  written by the very commentators who warned for two generations of the  political demise of NATO and the brilliant psychological campaigns of the  Warsaw Pact (that is, preventing us from deploying theater nuclear forces),  which, by the way, no longer exists, though the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization is as strong as ever.    On the American side, while it is true that President Bush has done  extraordinarily well in organizing world reaction against Hussein, it probably  helped that geopolitical conflict between the United States and the Soviet  Union has ended. As a result, there was no one else around to stoke up  opposition, and with only one banner to march behind, the world marched with  Bush more or less by default.    Similarly, our buildup of forces, impressive as it has been, has at all times  been fully regulated by objective forces. The U.S. Merchant Marine is so  depleted that we could not have deployed our heavy forces -- you can't fly  tanks from place to place very efficiently -- any faster regardless of the  situation. We came within a whisker of chartering at least one Russian ship to  help speed our deployment, which one might also call a sign of some  desperation.    Meanwhile, we have the comedy of manners taking place on Capitol Hill. One U.S.  senator lambasts the secretary of state for not having any decent alternatives  to the use of force, but on being asked for one, admits that he doesn't have a  clue. Another senator criticizes the secretary of defense for getting our  troops a little too ready for action, then admits that he once told the  secretary that getting our troops ready to win was his only job. An overweening  consistency, as Emerson liked to say, is the hobgoblin of little minds. One  wonders if the quote might not have been flubbed by his editor.    In fairness to Congress, one need only look at history. Horace Greeley who,  during the 1860 election campaign, was a firebrand for emancipation at any  price, immediately after the election of Lincoln decided that letting the  Southern states go in peace, while retaining their "peculiar institution," was  not so bad an idea after all.    As I said earlier, this is a most interesting case study of what actually  happens before historians get a chance to change it all.    The continuing theme is reasonably clear, however. People are all the same.  While still in the insurance business, I developed Clancy's Law of Accidents:  The only difference between a wise man and a fool is that a wise man makes much  more serious mistakes. Privates don't lose battles; generals do, and you have  to be smart to become a general. You must also be smart to be a physician, but  they kill patients all the time. It's merely human nature. Everyone makes  mistakes. One's title or office does not make one immune. The problem is that a  lot of people with titles and offices act as though they are immune, and the  media contribute to this fiction.    People in all fields of life fail to think their actions through. They begin to  do something about an immediate tactical problem but without examining the  downstream consequences of their action. Hitler invaded Poland thinking that  England and France would not honor their recent guarantee to the Poles. Johnson  put troops in Vietnam without examining their mission. Reagan put Marines in  Beirut without wondering what they would do there or when they might leave. The  Russians tried for years to outstrip Western military spending without noticing  that they vitiated their own economy in the process. The phenomenon is not  merely international, of course. Domestically, we installed a welfare system  that wrecked poor families and were surprised at the crime that resulted; we  started federal student loans and then watched college costs outstrip inflation  faster than a space-shuttle launch. And so forth. It would help if people  admitted mistakes, but those with titles and offices are never very keen on  that, are they -- and are the rest of us any more willing?    But the media -- and, later, historians with telescopic but selective hindsight  -- see purpose in random behavior and brilliance in befuddlement. Politicians  undertake actions most often by spasm or whim, perhaps with no more thought  than a motorist fighting his way home on the freeway, changing lanes to get a  few yards of progress, and in the process adding to the jam rather than letting  it sort itself out.    Doesn't anybody think? The cost of not thinking is often death and misery, and  if the media ever started pointing that out instead of imputing legitimacy to  every random remark of political figures, maybe we could save a life or two. At  the very least we might let people know what is actually going on.

headline:   IN THIS WHITE HOUSE, PRINCIPLE IS JUST THE POLITICS OF THE DAY;    SCHOLARSHIPS: THE REVERSAL OF THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT PROVES THAT THE  PRESIDENT DOESN'T BELIEVE HIS OWN WORDS ABOUT QUOTAS.   
text:   At a press conference last week announcing the Education Department's policy  against race-exclusive scholarships, Assistant Secretary Michael Williams  remarked that his job was to enforce the law. On Tuesday, at a press conference  amending that policy, Williams said that he had been "politically naive."    It is hard to imagine a worse sin than political naivete in the Bush  Administration, unless it is a conscientious effort to enforce the law. It  happens that Williams simultaneously committed both, becoming perfectly  symbolic of a presidency not only dedicated to expediency above duty but also  willfully confused about civil-rights law and lacking a coherent civil-rights  policy. Only the most result-oriented civil-rights liberal could applaud this  depressing chapter in the Bush Administration.    Williams, a 37-year-old lawyer who is black, has the duty of enforcing federal  civil-rights laws applying to higher education. He announced last week that  almost all scholarships designated exclusively for minority students were  illegal. Neither state nor private colleges and universities, he said, may  offer such aid.    But Williams had not factored in either the criticism of his policy by  civil-rights lobbies or the weakness of the chief executive's backbone. Wanting  no more from the lobbies, which had attacked him for successfully branding the  recent civil-rights legislation a "quotas" bill, Bush quickly caved, posting  notice through his press secretary that he was "very disturbed." Tuesday's  revised policy was a virtually complete reversal.    It is a wacky reversal. Williams now says that the relevant regulations will be  "enforced in such a way" -- enforced, not interpreted, mind you -- "as to  permit universities receiving federal funds to administer scholarships  established and funded by private persons or entities (who restrict)  eligibility for such scholarships to minority students."    In other words, and for example, the Education Department now will not bat an  eye as the Fiesta Bowl -- a private entity -- gives the universities of  Louisville and Alabama the $100,000 it had pledged to them exclusively for  minority students in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., until the politically  illiterate Williams flashed a red light of illegality. Louisville and Alabama  are state-funded public schools, but under the amended policy, the Education  Department also would avert its eyes if, for example, Pennsylvania's Grove City  College, which is private, were in the Fiesta Bowl and the recipient of its  $100,000 minority-scholarship fund. Only if a private institution were to use  its own funds for race-exclusive scholarships might the department trouble  itself to intervene, and then only, one assumes, if Williams asked the White  House to take a poll.    Conceivably the Administration could have offered a legal rationale for its  amended policy that is within the realm of reasonable discourse. But it did not  do so because it could not. Lawyers at both the Justice Department and the  White House concluded that the law compelled Williams' enforcement policy.  Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits recipients of federal funds  from providing different financial-aid programs on the basis of race or  national origin, and the Civil Rights Act of 1988 provides the legal basis for  applying Title VI to all aspects of private higher education.    Liberals comfortable with the new policy must ask whether today's victory is  tomorrow's disaster: The policy is so lacking in legal principle as to allow  not only a scholarship program named for Martin Luther King Jr. but also one  named for David Duke. Meanwhile, it should not pass liberal notice that the  Administration effectively rewrote the 1988 rights act; evidently, private  institutions will be allowed to do as private donors tell them to do. The Bush  Administration will not care.    Nor will it trouble itself with the obvious constitutional questions raised by  race-exclusive scholarships funded by states and localities. These things are  covered, according to Tuesday's announcement, "by the Supreme Court's decisions  construing the Constitution and thus cannot be addressed administratively."  This is an abdication of presidential responsibility to preserve the  Constitution.    Critics of Michael Williams say he should have cleared his policy with the  White House beforehand. But the significance of this story lies in the fact  that Williams dared enforce unambiguous law in a context that sharply raises  the most important question in civil rights, namely whether society's benefits  and opportunities should be allocated solely on the basis of such arbitrary  characteristics as race and ethnicity. Williams cannot be faulted for thinking  that a President who has made so much of his opposition to racial quotas would  not flinch at his enforcement action. That George Bush did so shows how  unprincipled and unbelievable is his opposition to racial preferences. On civil  rights, conservatives and liberals both can conclude that this is an  Administration with no policy but the politics of the day.

headline:   76ERS TAKE AIR OUT OF KIMBLE'S RETURN   
text:   It may have been Bo Kimble's homecoming Tuesday night at the Spectrum, but the  same old song and dance emerged for the Clippers, out of rhythm again in 110-99  loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.    Coach Mike Schuler may ask to cut in. That means a change could come as soon as  tonight, when his band plays at New Jersey. Nothing is for sure, especially  with Charles Smith's status uncertain after his already bruised left thigh was  bumped again, but Schuler informed his team that he is looking at the  possibilities.    However, when he talked with reporters after he game, he apparently had not  decided on any specifics. Maybe he was spending his energy trying to figure how  a group promoted as one of the best scoring teams has failed to reach 100  points for the fifth time in five games and how they have lost for the fifth  time in their last six.    "We just haven't got as consistent play as we want to," he said.    Schuler paused and looked at the final statistics: 19 turnovers, 45.2% shooting  and an unbalanced offense that got 31 of its points from Smith and 22 from Ken  Norman.    "Jeff Martin has played fairly well for us on this trip and has shot well,"  Schuler added. "Our starting guards were four of 17 tonight. Jeff has  consistently made his shots."    So Martin may be moved into the starting lineup?    "No, I'm really not sure," Schuler said.    Gary Grant, who as point guard usually sets the tempo for the offense, has been  as out of sync as anyone, which is no great mystery. Opposing teams have  spotted the absence of his usual freewheeling style for several games, and so  has he. For lack of a better description, it looks as if he is not having fun.    "I don't want to say the wrong word . . . " he said. "But I'm not having that  much fun. It's not anything to do with losing, because we're almost .500. I  don't know, but I think about it every night."    And will continue to do so. After Saturday's loss at Milwaukee, when he had  eight assists, four turnovers and two points, Grant called home to Los Angeles  and had his roommate start pulling out tapes from last season. When the  Clippers return from this six-game trip Thursday afternoon, he will start  watching, hoping to find the difference between then and now.    The one thing he insists is that this has nothing to do with the trade rumors  that won't go away. Indiana, Charlotte, Sacramento, New York -- will one be his  next home? Can't worry about it, Grant says.    But there has been a visible change in his game the last couple weeks, making  him appear far less aggressive. That has its good points -- he is averaging  only 2.8 turnovers the last nine outings, dropping his season mark to 3.3 --  but the third-year player has reached double figures in assists only three  times in 12 games.    "I'm thinking a lot instead of just playing," said Grant, also in a nine-of-31  shooting slump the last five games, including Tuesday, when he missed all four  shots he took and had six assists and five turnovers. "I never look for my shot  anymore. And when I do, it's because the 24-second clock is running out and I  throw up a three, like tonight."    Kimble's day was, at once, a thrill and average. This was his first trip to his  hometown as an NBA player, a long-awaited event among family and friends that  resulted in the Clipper rookie spending more than $2,000 for 80 or so tickets,  in addition to the comps he procured.    It started great, too: Kimble bought a house for his mother.    Then they played the game.    Not so great: four of 13 from the field. Kimble had 10 points and played 30  minutes, his best numbers in both categories in seven games, but the slump  continues. He's 15 of 53 (28.3%) the last seven outings.    "It was special for me, knowing all my family and friends were there," said  Kimble, who was greeted by a nice ovation from the Philadelphia crowd. "I don't  think we played well, the team or myself, but playing the first game against  the Sixers was something to remember. As a child, I always wanted to play at  the Spectrum. I don't want to say I was mesmerized by it all, but I was really  proud."    Clipper Notes    Ken Norman also had 20 rebounds, tying his career high from Jan. 13, 1989. . .  . Charles Barkley had 25 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists for the 76ers,  and Rickey Green added 21 points. . . . The Clippers allowed a team to shoot  50% or better for the third time in six games.

headline:   COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP;    AFTER SLOW START, O'NEAL SCORES 53 TO LEAD LSU   
text:   A record was the last thing on Shaquille O'Neal's mind after missing four shots  in a row in the first five minutes of the game.    But Louisiana State's 7-foot-1 sophomore center finally got going and didn't  stop until he had set an LSU Assembly Center record with 53 points, 37 in the  second half, to lead the 10th-ranked Tigers (5-1) to a 98-74 victory over  Arkansas State at Baton Rouge, La., Tuesday night.    The previous record was 50 set by Chris Jackson against Tennessee in 1989.    O'Neal finished with 18 field goals in 26 tries. He missed two shots in the  second half and made 17 of 21 from the foul line.    No. 6 Indiana 87, No. 18 Kentucky 84 -- Calbert Cheaney scored 23 points and  Jamal Meeks had a steal and two clinching free throws with 14 seconds left as  the Hoosiers beat foul-plagued Kentucky (5-2)) at Bloomington, Ind.    Five Kentucky players fouled out, including three in the final five minutes as  Indiana (9-1) rallied from a 73-69 deficit.    No. 23 Texas 87, UC Santa Barbara 84 -- Senior guard Joey Wright made five of  his 21 free throws in overtime as the Longhorns came back to defeat the Gauchos  at Goleta, Calif.    Wright made 21 of 27 free throws.    Santa Barbara (2-2) led, 39-29, at halftime and through much of the second half  until Guillermo Myers' three-point play with 2:06 remaining gave Texas (4-2) a  70-69 lead. Santa Barbara point guard Ray Kelly failed to score on four drives  to the basket late in regulation and in overtime and again missed on the final  three-point shot at the buzzer.    No. 24 Michigan State 81, Evansville 76 -- Steve Smith scored 35 points and  pulled down 12 rebounds to lead the Spartans past Evansville at East Lansing,  Mich.    Evansville (3-4) used a 10-1 run to pull within 71-70 with four minutes left,  but Michigan State (4-3) scored the next four points on a Smith free throw and  a three-pointer by Kris Weshinskey.    REGIONAL HIGHLIGHTS    EAST    Chris Brooks scored 19 points and grabbed 15 rebounds as West Virginia (3-2)  snapped a two-game skid with an 87-69 victory over Old Dominion (5-4) at  Morgantown, W.Va.    MIDWEST    Quitman Dillard scored 11 of his 21 points in the final 5:49 as St. Louis beat  Indiana State, 82-67, at Terre Haute, Ind. Dillard and three other Billikens  (4-5) scored in double figures.    SOUTH    Melvin Cheatum scored 20 points, including 16 of the first 20 for Alabama,  which broke a three-game losing streak with a 79-45 victory over VMI at  Tuscaloosa, Ala. Greg Fittz led VMI (3-5) with 13 points. James Robinson added  18 for Alabama (3-3). . . . Douglas Edwards scored a career-high 26 points as  Florida State (4-2) beat South Florida, 80-72, at Tallahassee, Fla., handing  the Bulls (5-1) their first loss of the season. .. . . . Todd Merritt had a  career-high 23 points and Brad Smith scored 22 points to lead Mississippi State  (6-0) to a 120-65 victory over Alcorn State at Starkville, Miss.    WEST    Wilbert Hooker was nine for nine from the field and scored a career-high 26  points to lead Fresno State (3-3) to an 86-68 victory over Mississippi Valley  State (4-5) at Fresno. Among Hooker's shots were four from three-point range. .  . . LaCoby Phillips scored 22 points to lead Santa Clara (6-4) to an 81-66  victory over Nevada (2-8) at Santa Clara.

text:   X-rays on inside linebacker Frank Stams' injured right knee revealed some  ligament damage, and he will miss the rest of the season. But Stams, who hurt  the knee in the first half of Monday night's loss to the San Francisco 49ers,  appears to have escaped serious injury, Coach John Robinson said Tuesday.    Robinson said Bruce Klostermann will play at Stams' spot.    Tight end Damone Johnson, who reinjured his hamstring, and guard Tom Newberry,  who sprained his left ankle. Robinson said both look doubtful for Sunday's game  at Atlanta.    Robinson said that he plans to play both Gaston Green and Cleveland Gary at  tailback in the remaining two games of 1990, but that he wasn't sure who would  be the starter. Robinson also said that No. 1 pick Bern Brostek, who played  left guard after Newberry went down, did an adequate job. TIM KAWAKAMI

text:   Six people were indicted on drug charges by a federal grand jury in San Diego,  the U.S. attorney's office said Tuesday.    The indictment unsealed Monday accused three of the defendants of providing  laboratory supplies and chemical ingredients to their co-defendants, who  allegedly used them to produce batches of methamphetamine.    One of the defendants, Thomas M. Schultz, was the general manager of Chem Labs,  a Placentia business that allegedly suppled chemicals and equipment to the ring  and introduced methamphetamine "cookers" to people who could supply them with  vital precursor chemicals, Assistant U.S. Atty. Amalia Meza said.    Schultz, 32, is being held on separate charges in Yankton, S.D., Meza said.    Also charged with supplying chemicals were Robert Grimsley, 33, of Ontario and  George Khoury, 32, of Riverside.    Meza said Grimsley was arraigned in San Diego Monday afternoon on a charge of  conspiracy to manufacture and possess methamphetamine and was lodged at the  Metropolitan Correctional Center on $150,000 bail.    Khoury was a fugitive along with the other defendants; Jerry Barrow, 59, of Sun  City and Robert Templeton, 55, and his wife, Judy, of Lihue, Hawaii.    The defendants all are charged with conspiracy.

headline:   JUDGE TELLS FARMER TO STOP SELLING TREES AT COLLEGE   
text:   Farmer Joe Cicero was ordered by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday to  stop selling Christmas trees from his popular fruit and vegetable stand at  Pierce College.    Judge David P. Yaffe issued a preliminary injunction barring the sales because  they were a "clear violation" of the agreement Cicero has with the college to  sell produce he grows on 15 acres of Pierce land in Woodland Hills. Yaffe said  campus administrators are entitled to prohibit the sales.    Cicero's attorney plans to appeal the order, which is scheduled to take effect  today.    Despite the ruling, Cicero was in good spirits Tuesday. He said that even if he  loses his appeal and is prevented from selling trees for the six days before  Christmas, he considers his venture a success.    Sales at the lot boomed this year as community members turned out to support  Cicero, who characterized himself as David struggling against a Christmas tree  Goliath -- competitor Stu Miller, whose company operates more than 50 lots  around the state, including one across the street from the Cicero Farms stand  at Victory Boulevard and De Soto Avenue.    "Never in the history of Cicero Farms have we had sales like we have now," he  said. "We have had so much community support it's unbelieveable."    Cicero's problems began last year when Miller filed a lawsuit charging the Los  Angeles Community College District with aiding unfair competition by letting  Cicero sell trees without giving other tree dealers the opportunity to bid for  the site.    To settle the suit, district officials agreed to prevent Cicero from selling  trees. The district believed that its agreement with him allowed the sale of  products grown on the Pierce property. His trees were from the Pacific  Northwest.    But Cicero disagreed with the college and began planning tree sales. Harold  Kippen, Cicero's attorney, said the farmer had the right to sell trees and  other products not grown on the property because his agreement with Pierce did  not specifically prohibit such sales and because the college had allowed them  in the past.    "We feel we have a right to sell those trees," Kippen said.    The college took the issue to court in November. A Superior Court judge  temporarily prohibited Cicero from opening his lot, but that order was  overturned by an appellate judge pending a ruling on the college's request for  a preliminary injunction.    Yaffe said Tuesday that the college district did in fact have the right to  prevent the tree sales "to protect itself from the potential liability" from  Miller's lawsuit.    Cicero said the publicity he gained from his court battles enabled him to sell  more than the 8,000 trees he originally ordered this year, and he recently  received another order for thousands more. Even if he cannot sell them, he  said, he has made enough in profits to pay for those trees.    "This has been nothing but good for us," he said.    But Jim Lynch, an attorney representing the college district, said that because  of Cicero's defiance, district administrators may sever the agreement.

headline:   SPECIFIC PLAN FOR VENTURA BOULEVARD GETS TENTATIVE OK;    DEVELOPMENT: A COUNCILWOMAN'S DECISION TO WITHHOLD HER VOTE DELAYS FINAL  ACTION, MEANING THAT MORE PROJECTS COULD SQUEAK BY UNDER THE OLD RULES.   
text:   The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday gave tentative approval to a sweeping  set of building rules for Ventura Boulevard aimed at controlling development on  the San Fernando Valley's "Main Street" and generating the funds to cope with  traffic.    Initiated five years ago in response to an intense building boom, the so-called  Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan will affect all 17 miles of the commercial  corridor north of the Santa Monica Mountains. It will govern the size, height  and uses of buildings from Studio City to Woodland Hills, and was designed to  revive the small, service-oriented businesses that have been lost to glitzy  shopping centers and office buildings.    Described by officials as unprecedented in scope, the Specific Plan is expected  to win final approval at the council's Jan. 4 meeting. Proponents had hoped  that it would be adopted Tuesday, but Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' decision  to withhold her vote delayed final approval, prompting concerns that some new  projects may be able to squeak in the door.    "It is a triumph, not only to the people along the corridor but to the whole  city," said Councilman Hal Bernson, who predicted that the plan may become a  model for the city.    Slow-growth activists were less effusive, saying that in the five years it has  taken to prepare the plan, the faces of their neighborhoods have changed and  the quality of life has diminished, mainly because of large commercial projects  and the resulting traffic.    "In Encino, we've had nothing but runaway development, and it really should  never have been allowed to occur from Day 1," said Kathy Lewis, vice president  of the Encino Property Owners Assn. "I hope there's some hope for the other  communities and that they might learn by the disaster that occurred in ours."    "My hair was black when it started," Sherman Oaks resident Fred Kramer, who  served on the plan's citizens advisory committee, told the City Council.  "Today, it's gray. I urge you to pass this today before it turns white."    The complicated ordinance addresses traffic, design and the environment, and  cost the city about $600,000 in consultants' fees, Principal City Planner  Robert H. Sutton said. Its preparation began in early 1986 with a panel of City  Council-appointed homeowners and developers, and it received Planning  Commission approval in March.    Perhaps most significantly, the plan charges developers a fee for vehicle trips  their projects will add to    the congested boulevard -- money that the city will use to add traffic signals  and widen streets. The "trip fees," already in use in some Westside coastal  communities, will vary among each of the boulevard's five neighborhoods,  ranging from $2,496 per added trip in Woodland Hills to $4,277 in Encino and  Sherman Oaks. Trips are determined by counting cars that pass a certain point  in an hour.    The plan also curtails development by placing a limit of 29,000 new car trips  on the boulevard, now the site of 70,000 car trips per day. But if 12 crucial  intersections are found to be seriously congested when 14,000 new car trips  have been added, even stricter building controls will take effect.    Building heights will generally be limited to two and three stories, although  the City Council exempted four projects from the plan. These include two  13-story office towers and one 10-story building planned for Ventura and  Topanga Canyon boulevards in Woodland Hills, and a 335,000-square-foot office  building at Ventura Boulevard and Hayvenhurst Avenue in Encino. Developers of  those projects worked out prior agreements with the city.    One project that was denied an exemption -- a controversial office and retail  complex in Sherman Oaks -- may have indirectly prevented the Specific Plan from  receiving final adoption Tuesday. The project, which could be three stories  under existing rules but only two under the Specific Plan, is the focus of a  neighborhood battle.    Benjamin M. Reznik, attorney for developer Jacky Gamliel, argued that his  client deserved an exemption because Gamliel was on the verge of obtaining his  building permits after 18 months of city review. Although Reznik failed to win  an exemption, Flores and Councilman Robert Farrell said that they were  concerned about builders with projects nearing approval and that it was unfair  to subject them to a new set of rules.    When the Specific Plan came up for a vote, Flores took the unusual step of  withholding her ballot, thus preventing the ordinance from winning immediate  adoption with the needed approval of 12 members. Tuesday's vote was 11 to 0.    The same thing happened to an ordinance proposed by Councilman Michael Woo that  would strictly limit building permits on the boulevard for as much as six  months. Woo called for the modified building moratorium to give city officials  a chance to study and implement the new Specific Plan. Despite the delay, the  proposal is expected to win adoption Jan. 4.    What remains unclear is whether Woo's building freeze will take effect  immediately upon adoption Jan. 4 or a month later, when the Specific Plan goes  into effect.    Homeowners were disappointed when Flores and Councilman Ernani Bernardi voted  against a plan by Woo that would have made the freeze effective immediately --  again forcing the issue to be decided Jan. 4.    "It seems that Joan Milke Flores has jeopardized a lot of neighborhoods along  Ventura Boulevard. We can now expect a rash of building permits to be requested  before Jan. 4," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners  Assn. "One person can do a lot of damage."

headline:   DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSES EVACUATED AFTER TANKS RUPTURED   
text:   Authorities in Lancaster evacuated a four-block area of commercial and  industrial buildings Tuesday after construction workers ruptured two  underground liquid storage tanks thought to contain gasoline, county fire  officials said.    Businesses near Avenue J and the Sierra Highway were evacuated at 12:30 p.m.  when workers installing city street lights hit the tanks, said Howard Spinrad,  a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department.    About 20 businesses were evacuated, Sheriff's Lt. Dan Ridder said. It was not  known how many people were evacuated.    Officials said they believe that the liquid in the tanks is gasoline, but they  were unsure because of the age of the tanks.    The 350- to 450-gallon receptacles were buried 10 feet underground and may have  been left behind by the operators of a gas station, authorities said.    "It may have been a gas station in operation years and years ago, and nobody  knew they were there," Spinrad said of the tanks. The tanks were believed to be  40 to 50 years old.    Evacuated workers were allowed to return about 5 p.m.    Authorities were investigating the incident.

headline:   BOTTLING UP BARS;    ACTIVIST OPPOSES LICENSES UNTIL BUSINESSES USE ALCOHOL ABUSE PROGRAMS   
text:   Like thousands of other Westside residents, Beverly Hills pediatrician Trisha  Roth has discovered that the rejuvenated 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica  now boasts a thriving night life and an impressive array of trendy restaurants  and bars.    Some restaurant and bar owners wish she had not.    Roth has made a name for herself in her home city as a vigorous and sometimes  strident opponent of alcohol abuse. She has campaigned before the City Council,  school board and PTA for programs to prevent the serving of alcohol to minors  and to discourage drinkers from driving. In her unsuccessful effort to win a  seat on the Beverly Hills City Council earlier this year, an anti-alcohol  message was a major component of her campaign.    Now, she is branching out. In recent months, Roth has been raising objections  before the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Department to liquor license  applications from new Westside businesses, and she has paid particular  attention to the three-block outdoor mall.    The protests have forced the state agency to hold a hearing before granting a  license, a process that can hold up a license for months. Roth does not  withdraw her protests unless the applicants agree to implement programs  encouraging responsible drinking.    Her latest protest is over a liquor license sought by the Golden Monkey Cafe,  which is scheduled to open in February on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard  and 3rd Street.    Roth says she is pleased that she has found a way to force establishments that  seek liquor licenses to develop designated-driver programs, but she complains  that some restaurants have gone back on their word and have done little or  nothing to discourage drinking and driving once the licenses have been issued.    Carl Falletta, a spokesman for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Department, said  that new applications for full liquor licenses generally take about three  months to approve but that a protest such as Roth's can extend the process to a  year.    The state does not require licensees to have designated driver or server  training programs, Falletta said.    Thomas H. Carroll, executive director of the Bayside District Corp., the  nonprofit group that manages the Promenade, said most proprietors are  responsible and have drunk-driving programs, although perhaps not at the level  Roth would like.    Carroll said owners realize that the sale of alcohol is vital to the success of  their businesses, and they do not want to risk losing their licenses.    Carroll said the idea of a coordinated designated-driver program for the  Promenade will be among the items discussed at a meeting of proprietors this  week.    Councilman Dennis Zane, a force in the mall's renovation, said that he believes  most proprietors are acting responsibly but that the city may be in a position  to encourage more cooperation from licensees.    Roth insists that she is not singling out the Promenade in her campaign. In  fact, she makes protests most new license applications on the Westside. It is  with the Promenade protests that she has managed to draw city officials and  licensees into at least preliminary negotiations for a comprehensive policy for  businesses.    Roth says, ideally, she would want a highly visible program at every  liquor-serving establishment and that every group of patrons has a designated  driver. That person would wear a button and would be served free coffee or soft  drinks. She said she would also like to see so-called notices posted at each  table warning against the dangers of drinking and driving.    Randy Larscheid, general manager of the Golden Monkey Cafe, said his 344-seat  restaurant will have such a program in place for its late-February opening.    Another Promenade restaurant, Chillers, has printed the phrase "Please don't  drink and drive" on plastic cups that customers can take home. That was part of  an agreement that owners had to make to get Roth to withdraw her protest of  their liquor license earlier this year.    Chillers, which attracts a college crowd, also provides a "party bus" on  Tuesday nights to provide transportation for UCLA and USC students.    Not all Promenade restaurant owners feel they have to go that far to promote  responsible drinking.    "Anything we can do to make everybody safe is good, but I'm not going to make  anyone wear a badge," said Jivan Tabibian, managing owner of Remi, a new  Italian restaurant.

headline:   COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: BANACHOWSKIS ARE A FAMILY OF CHAMPIONS   
text:   Amy Banachowski and Andy Banachowski are certainly not singing the holiday  blues, but they've prepared themselves for what will likely be an anticlimactic  Christmas. That's because within the past five weeks Andy, the women's  volleyball coach at UCLA, and his daughter Amy, a freshman setter at UC San  Diego, already received their ultimate gifts.    The presents didn't come gift-wrapped, and they won't be taken for granted.  But, as Andy said, "We can walk around all year now with a smile on our faces."    The gift? National championships for both of them.    Top-ranked UCLA routed Pacific, 15-9, 15-12, 15-7, Saturday to capture the NCAA  Division I championship in College Park, Md., giving the elder Banachowski his  fifth national crown since he started at UCLA in 1970. Nearly a month earlier,  Amy led UCSD to its sixth NCAA Division III title in 10 years, defeating  Washington University in five games.    Afterward, Amy called her father in Washington, where the Bruins were in the  midst of a Pac-10 road trip and said, "Dad, I've got mine. Now you've got to do  it, too."    Amy figured she could give her dad a little needling, knowing he could take it.  UCLA (36-1) had spent most of the season at the top of the rankings and Andy,  the dean of college coaches, has led the Bruins to a top-four finish or better  in 17 of the past 20 seasons. During those times, Andy said, Amy was probably  hanging around the gym, going unnoticed.    "She didn't try to put too much pressure on me," Andy said. "She didn't try to  lord it over me. But I could tell how happy she was to have won it."    "I had to give him a little bit of a hard time," Amy said. "It was fun having  the same kind of excitement at the end of the season."    Amy's dad is arguably the best coach in women's collegiate history, with his  646-140 cumulative record and .821 winning percentage in 24 seasons. UCLA was  23-1 his first season. But the birth of Amy two years later ranks as one of his  greatest successes.    A year ago, Amy was unrecruited and apparently unwanted by any big school as  she could do no better than third-string setter at state champion Mira Costa  High. Amy, who is 5-feet-6, rarely played as she was overshadowed by all-state  setter Piper Hahn (now at Stanford) and a second-string player that was much  taller.    So she took up Coach Doug Dannevik's offering to join Division III power UCSD,  which entered the 1990 season without a setter and only one returning starter.  Amy not only had an opportunity to play, but she won the starting position.  And, culminating a most improbable season, it was Amy who led the inexperienced  Tritons (37-8) to a 15-4, 13-15, 9-15, 15-8, 15-6 upset of Washington in the  Division III final Nov. 17 in St. Louis.    "We could not have won the national championship if Amy had not played as if  she was a junior or senior," said Dannevik, who realized early in the season  that he had stolen a player with superior athletic ability and rare court  savvy. "I just think she's a very talented kid with that knack that you can't  coach. Very seldom did she make a mistake in a match."    Because of their conflicting schedules, Andy was able to see Amy play just  once. But throughout the season he received compliments from other coaches. And  the one time he did see his daughter play, he wanted to approach it from a  coach's perspective, not through a father's eyes.    "There were a couple of situations where she could have made some ball-handling  errors or not set to the right person," Andy said. "But she always made the  right play. And she made some great plays. To see that really was a great  feeling."    Meeter Meter Running: Christian Heritage basketball center Rob Meeter is 13  rebounds from becoming the Hawks' all-time rebounding leader. By the end of the  season, he should have a comfortable cushion over record holder Will  Cunningham, now a Hawks assistant coach. Cunningham, who played four seasons,  finished last year with 678 rebounds. Meeter has 666.    Meeter also entered the week ranked 20th in the NAIA in shooting percentage at  .657. He leads Christian Heritage (3-8) in scoring with 12.8 points a game. But  the fact that Meeter is leading the Hawks at all comes as a mild surprise. He  stands just 6-6 and he is 29.    Feather In His Cap: Grossmont College men's Coach Fred Featherstone, who has  taught volleyball at every level except Division I, was recently selected as  one of four coaches for the Olympic Festival in July. Featherstone will direct  the month-long tryout and camp, coaching a Western Region team made up of  college freshmen and sophomores at Loyola Marymount College.    Featherstone, 44, who coached a group of San Diego high school boys to a  surprising second-place finish in the 1990 Junior Olympics in July, said he  didn't expect to be chosen but speculated that it might have been because of  his enduring belief in the future of collegiate men's volleyball.    Said Featherstone: "Over time, it will be just as competitive as football and  basketball."

headline:   PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;    WEEKDAY UPDATE;    CHARGERS;    BUTTS MIGHT STAY OUT FOR REST OF SEASON   
text:   Coach Dan Henning, concerned about the possibility of long-term problems to the  injured foot of running back Marion Butts, said he might not play him for the  remainder of the season.    Henning said Butts was better Tuesday upon examination, but he said he has been  advised that further activity may sideline Butts for an extended period of  time.    "It's a strained something in the foot," Henning said. "When they tell you this  guy could be further injured to the point where you could lose him for a year,  then you got something to think about. He's been arguably the biggest threat we  have, and to lose him for a year would be foolish under these conditions."    Butts is the NFL's leading rusher with 1,225 yards, and is being closely  pursued by Detroit's Barry Sanders with 1,148 yards and Buffalo's Thurman  Thomas with 1,143 yards.    "Butts wants to play," Henning said. "I told him that's going to be my  decision. Whether he jumps on the table and wants to play and can run up and  down the field, if I feel that's still a definite possibility that he can get  hurt, then there's a good chance he won't play the rest of the year."    Rod Bernstine, who has been on injured reserve with a hamstring pull, has been  the team's No. 2 rusher with 399 yards on 82 carries.    "I would say it would be 90-10 we would probably activate Bernstine," Henning  said. "We'll definitely start to practice him and see how he is before we use  that move. If he's not 100 percent then we'll have to do something else."    The Chargers announced a five-year contract extension to the Noble Broadcasting  Group and XTRA radio to broadcast games through the 1996 season. XTRA, which  has broadcast the games the past four years, produces an eight-hour game day  package for all 20 pre-season and regular-season games. T.J. SIMERS

headline:   SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: CATLIN, MERTENS TO PLAY FOR SDSU   
text:   Scott Catlin, a defensive back from Southwestern Community College, has signed  a national letter of intent to play football at San Diego State next year, and  Aaron Mertens, an offensive lineman from Kearny High, has orally committed to  the Aztecs.    Catlin, 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds, was named first-team all-Southern Division in  the Mission Conference as both a defensive back and a kick returner. He had 12  pass breakups and two interceptions last fall. He returned those interceptions  a total of 150 yards -- one for a 100-yard touchdown and another for 50 yards.  He also averaged 24.4 yards per kick return and 18.2 per punt return.    "He's a great cover guy," Southwestern Coach Bill Kinney said. "In our scheme,  we use a lot of man-to-man coverage and combinations. When we used the combos,  we usually left him by himself (in the coverage) and he did a great job all  year long.    "He's a good tackler and a very aggressive defensive player."    Kinney said Texas El Paso, San Jose State and Fresno State also recruited  Catlin, who will enroll in SDSU in time for spring football. Catlin is a  graduate of Sweetwater High School.    SDSU has now signed two community college players for next season -- Catlin and  Alex Semenik, a tight end from Scottsdale (Ariz.) Community College. Those are  the two positions SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said at the end of the season that he  wanted to fill with community college players.    Mertens, a 6-6, 230-pound center, was named to the Los Angeles Times'  all-county second team.    "His work ethic is the No. 1 thing that stands out about him," Kearny Coach  Willie Matson said. "He's the hardest-working kid we've ever had at Kearny."    Although Mertens decided against officially visiting other schools, Matson said  Mertens was seriously recruited by Arizona State, Cal, Washington, Washington  State, Colorado, Colorado State, Oregon and Iowa.    Matson said Mertens plans to sign a letter of intent on Feb. 6, the first day  high school players are allowed to do so. SCOTT MILLER

headline:   SCREEN STYLE: LOVE AND DEATH AND CLOROX   
text:   THE FILM: "Hamlet," directed by Franco Zeffirelli and written by . . . well,  you know.    THE CLIFF NOTES REMINDER: Hamlet (Mel Gibson), the great and melancholy Dane,  gets the word from the ghost of his father the king (Paul Scofield) that Uncle  Claudius (Alan Bates) murdered Dad and married Mom (Glenn Close). Paralyzed by  inaction -- this is not "Lethal Poignard II" -- his grip on love and self go  down the drain, and just about everybody dies.    THE LOOK: Nothing so trendy as to make you snatch up your credit card and head  for Melrose yelling, "I've got to have that.' Understandably. Someone or  other's been putting clothes on these people for almost 400 years. The costumes  are unobtrusive -- this isn't MTV style over substance -- yet are not lost in  the spaces they had to occupy. Italian designer Mauricio Millenotti has  costumed films, including the Zeffirelli/Shakespeare "Otello," opera,  television and ballets and has a command of the grand scale. Remember, "Hamlet"  as a story was 12th-Century ancient history when Shakespeare did it in the  17th, and he had some costuming anachronisms of his own, like a reference to  "chopines," platform shoes unknown in Denmark.    The Clorox factor is more than apparent. The principals' clothes tend to suffer  by their incredible Hollywood tidiness, less suggestive of the 12th or even  17th Century than a modern-day Maytag side-by-side. There is the antiseptic  sheen of a '40s MGM spectacular where even the horses' teeth looked like they  had been capped. Compare it to Kenneth Branagh's wonderfully grimy film version  of "Henry V," released here last fall. The tons of coal dust spread over  Hamlet's castle for authentic weathering never touched its big-name residents.  At least Ophelia (Helena Bonham-Carter) and Hamlet get more disordered-looking  as their minds do. (Look for Hamlet in the library, in a scruffy sweater and  throwing his boot.)    THE SUPERB: With the exception of one Gertrude (Close) headdress that looks  like a brain-stem injury surgical restraint, the jewelry and adornments are  marvelous, particularly the Celtic-looking wrought cloak clasps. The crowns,  rough and heavy jeweled bands, are absolutely on-11th-Century target, evoking  the oldest surviving crown in Europe, of the Empress Kunigunde of Luxembourg.  Gertrude's shoulder-duster earrings are pure Visigoth. Now you might see these  turn up on Melrose.    THE SILLY: Gertrude's blond Viking braids, which look like they were extruded  from a butterscotch Dairy Queen machine. And one unfortunate aqua surcoat that  looks exactly like my mother's chenille bedspread.    THE CREDIBLE: The authentic reliance on knits, embroidery and worked adornment  for ornamentation. Ophelia in simple, virginal cream-colored smocks is in  deliberate, unsubtle contrast to the bright colors of Gertrude's ardent  newlywed sexuality, turquoise and wine reds. And, of course, Hamlet's raiment  is a fixed point of almost unrelieved black, a color in great vogue among  Elizabethans. Gibson has a modern face, and there are moments when, in  leggings, boots, a leather jerkin whose big, loose stitches cry out "olde," he  could sit down front at a Madonna concert without turning too many heads.    THE SOURCES: Less likely to catch on as street-style than, say, "Dick Tracy,"  even if there were such a boutique as "Thor's Threads" to handle this line. But  it's like Mrs. Roten told us in 10th grade English -- you're supposed to listen  to this. PATT MORRISON

headline:   BOOK REVIEW;    A CHILLING LOOK AT THE KING OF THE ARCTIC;    WHITE BEAR; ENCOUNTERS WITH THE MASTER OF THE ARCTIC ICE BY CHARLES T. FEAZEL  HENRY HOLT$22.50, 240 PAGES   
text:   "When the watchdog growls at the door, someone's coming," goes the conventional  wisdom of the Arctic. "When it hides under the table, look out for bears!"    We are offered this ominous advice by Charles T. Feazel in "White Bear," an  intimate account of Ursus maritimus, a creature that most of us encounter only  in the sterile confines of a zoo.    The book is an irresistible armchair adventure, a natural history of the  Arctic, an anthropological study of its native peoples, and -- above all -- a  fascinating collection of the lore and legend of the polar bear.    "Always, it seems, the bear is waiting," Feazel writes. "Throughout the  centuries there have been only three constants in the Arctic: the white and the  cold and the bears."    Feazel, a geologist by training and an adventurer at heart, encountered the  polar bear during various expeditions in the polar region.    At an average weight of 1,000 pounds, he tells us, the polar bear is the  largest predator on earth. A polar bear may stand taller than 10 feet, with a  reach of 14 feet, and it can easily outrun a person through ice and snow.    And a polar bear, so cuddly in appearance, will eat almost anything, from  rodents to stranded whales -- even its own young:    "In mute testimony to this natural process," Feazel writes, "tiny claws of cubs  are sometimes found in polar bear droppings."    The great beast is both a living creature and a totem of immense potency to the  native dwellers of the Arctic.    "Nanook," as the bear is known, "was clearly the most powerful element in the  lives of such people," Feazel explains. "He determined the patterns of their  lives and often the circumstances of their death. Awesome and awful, he  possessed a majesty innately worthy of worship."    What impresses Feazel most, however, is the marvelously utilitarian design and  function of the polar bear's anatomy. Tooth, bone, fur and blubber have evolved  into an ideal technology for survival in the Arctic.    In fact, the polar bear is so well-suited to the frigid temperatures of the  polar winter that its greatest peril is heat and hunger in summertime: "A polar  bear may have to live for half a year without a meal during the ice-free  season," Feazel explains, "when he can't hunt effectively."    The polar bear is still hunted by the native peoples of the Arctic, but -- as  Feazel warns -- the real enemies of "Nanook" are the intrusions of the modern  world into the once-pristine environment of the Arctic.    Today, the polar bear is at risk from chemicals and heavy metals in the food  chain, the detritus of oil drilling (and oil spills), and even the threat of  global warming.    Still, Feazel reminds us that the most urgent threat of all are poachers and  pampered tourists armed with high-powered rifles: Shooting is still the most  frequent cause of death among polar bears.    Feazel never strays far from hard science, and his prose is only rarely lyrical  or rhapsodic. But he cannot resist the temptation to anthropomorphize the polar  bear.    He repeatedly depicts "Nanook" in human-like postures: "Picture a flamboyant  prizefighter, arrogant in his heavy fur coat, mugging for the camera." He  speculates that bears kill more prey than they can eat for "the sheer pleasure  of the kill."    And Feazel, an earnest and good-natured storyteller, is not above a pun. "The  end of this tale," he quips, after a top-to-bottom inventory of the polar  bear's anatomy, "is the end of the tail."    Next: Judith Freeman reviews "Sirens" by Stephen Pett (Vintage).

headline:   PRIEST ELECTED IN HAITI REMAINS IN SECLUSION   
text:   Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the leftist Catholic priest who won Haiti's  first fully free democratic election Sunday, remained in seclusion Tuesday,  still a mystery to diplomats, political observers and others who wonder where  he plans to take the strife-torn, impoverished country.    The mild-mannered, 37-year-old pastor to the poor campaigned on a vague  platform extolling Haitian self-sufficiency and promising justice, food and  jobs to his followers. But he never specified how he would manage the country  to achieve his goals.    The fiery sermons that gave Aristide a messiah-like aura to millions of  Haitians during the years that he preached against electoral politics were  often anti-American, anti-capitalist and sometimes fell barely short of calls  for violence against the country's conservative establishment.    "It was always the workers against the boss with no shades of gray in between,"  said a senior Western diplomat. "Now if he wants the country to run, he's going  to have to work with the bosses."    The problem, according to Haitian political veterans, is that the often  mystical Aristide, a specialist in liberation theology, has been so far removed  from the political and economic life of the country that he has little to work  with in shaping an administration that can re-organize and run the Haitian  bureaucracy and control the largely undisciplined army.    "Neither Aristide nor the mixed team of advisers around him have any background  in government," said a diplomat. "They range from the extreme left, including a  Communist Party founder, to liberal civic activists -- teachers, neighborhood  civic leaders, people with no background in management."    But to Aristide's followers and a few outsiders who have talked to him since  his landslide victory Sunday, the ascetic priest has appeared open to hearing a  range of opinions as he begins organizing a transition team to take power after  the presidential inauguration Feb. 7.    U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams appeared confident that Aristide will succeed in  forming a stable government and has recommended that Washington offer as much  assistance as it can.    "We will try to be helpful, but the decision rests in Washington and Congress,"  Adams said in an interview Tuesday. "We are going to make an effort to  significantly increase what we can do for Haiti. I have recommended that."    Meanwhile, Aristide's headquarters accepted the army's denial that its soldiers  or police had shot and killed a pregnant woman during a massive victory  celebration for the popular priest Monday. While many people claimed to have  witnessed the incident, independent foreigners who examined the body said their  were no gunshot wounds and it appeared more likely that she had been run over  by a vehicle.

headline:   MORNING BRIEFING: HE DIDN'T DO ANY WAXING, HE GOT WAXED   
text:   His team lost to Houston on Sunday, and Kansas City reserve running back Todd  McNair covered a lot of ground.    Running downfield in the third quarter as a member of the Chiefs' kickoff team,  McNair was sandwiched between two Oilers. He suffered a mild concussion and lay  unconscious on the turf for several minutes while team officials huddled over  him. Finally, he was led to the sideline in a wobbly state.    And in his native state, New Jersey.    Monday, McNair told Doug Tucker of the Associated Press: "I was dreaming. I was  back home in Jersey with my girl. I was waxing my car down, and then I was  driving my car. It was warm. The windows were down."    Meanwhile, in Kansas City, it remained cold and rainy.    Add dream state: Said McNair: "They said I came off smiling and telling people  I was going back in. But I don't remember any of that. I got to the sideline  and I saw the players and the fans and I thought, 'Hey, I'm dreaming that I'm  in a game.' "    Team officials said McNair will be able to play Sunday at San Diego.    Said McNair: "Everybody was shook up and scared, but today they're joking.  They're calling me 'Sleepy.' "    Was he scared?    Said McNair: "I wasn't scared because I wasn't there."    Trivia time: Name the only team to lose two games and be ranked No. 1 in the AP  college football poll.    New help: After the Dodgers introduced Bob Ojeda and Brett Butler at a news  conference Monday, Orel Hershiser recalled a conversation he'd had with his  6-year-old son, Quinton, during the weekend.    Said Hershiser: "I picked up the paper and said, 'Gee, we got Butler.' Quinton  said, 'Why do we need a butler? We already have a live-in.' "    Junkyard Dogs: Before the recent Georgia-Georgia Tech game, Tony Barnhart of  the Atlanta Journal and Constitution asked Georgia's athletic director and  former football coach, Vince Dooley, to describe his "funniest memory" of the  rivalry.    Dooley recalled that in 1966, a group of Georgia fans brought a cannon to the  game.    With Georgia trailing, 7-6, Bulldog kicker Bobby Etter was about to make  contact on the conversion attempt when the cannon went off, distracting him.    Georgia won, 23-14, but Dooley recalled: "It was the first extra point he had  missed all year. The next day those fans buried that cannon in the  Chattahoochee (River). We never had any thought of having a cannon here again."    Bring on Trottier: No self-respecting hockey fan will believe this, but Lemieux  is having a great year.    The horse, Lemieux.    A 3-year-old colt named for Pittsburgh Penguin star Mario Lemieux, the two-time  NHL scoring champion, won the $5,000 Open Invitational Trot at the Meadows  harness racing track near Washington, Pa., Sunday night. It was his second  consecutive victory.    That makes six victories in 21 starts. Meanwhile, the horse's namesake  continues to recover from a back infection that has kept him out of action.    Trivia answer: Minnesota, in 1960. The Golden Gophers, declared national  champion before the bowls, lost to Washington in the 1961 Rose Bowl and  finished 8-2.    Quotebook: Philadelphia 76er forward Charles Barkley, 27, when asked about  Boston's aging front line of Larry Bird, 34, Kevin McHale, 33, and Robert  Parish, 37: "I'd rather have older guys who are great players than younger guys  who stink."

The Rams and 49ers proved that NFL games can last 3 hours 8 minutes even  without a lot of instant replay reviews. . . .

headline:   LOS ALAMITOS;    SCHVANEVELDT HAS THE FINAL WORD   
text:   Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt triumphantly chewed his gum and displayed rare  emotion Saturday night in the winner's circle at Los Alamitos.    The usually stoic conditioner had won the Champion of Champions quarter horse  race with Dash For Speed for an unprecedented fifth time but this one was  special.    Schvaneveldt, a 56-year-old Idaho native, did not become the all-time leader at  Los Alamitos by second-guessing his program. Despite two disappointing efforts  by Dash For Speed before the $250,000 race, Schvaneveldt calmly maintained that  nothing was wrong and his confidence never wavered.    "It's a great feeling," said an animated Schvaneveldt. "This one is greater  because this mare was beaten twice, and everybody said she was done and we  shouldn't have brought her back.    "She's been training good all the time but didn't get away in her last two.  Nothing was wrong with her but it was hard to convince her owners she was just  losing her back end.    "I had a lot of pressure but pressure doesn't bother me. I like pressure.    "I never changed one earthly thing since I got her this summer. When you go to  changing, you get beat!    "I think this is the toughest field they've assembled but when she breaks in  front, it takes a good horse to beat her."    Said co-owner Bobby Blakeman, "Blane's got to be the king. He can get a horse  ready for a race like this better than anybody."    Added jockey Kip Didericksen, "I told the pony boy going to the gate that I was  the winner. I loped her one lap around a week ago Friday, and it was the best  she ever tracked. She's just been going good, and I liked the hole she drew  (No. 7) and the way the race set up."    Although she was the top money-winner in the lineup and was being trained and  ridden by meet leaders, Dash For Speed was dismissed at 8-1, the  seventh-longest price in the extremely competitive 10-horse field.    Texan Blakeman, who owns the mare in partnership with Colorado cattleman Tom  Bradbury, said Dash For Speed has been retired and will be vanned to his  253-acre mare care center 40 miles from Ft. Worth this week.    "We're going to let her be a mommy," said Blakeman, who hopes to select a daddy  this month.    The owners enjoyed the best of both worlds with her this year, racing her in a  bid for world champion honors while a recipient mare carried her first foal  after an embryo transplant in April.    The practice is illegal in thoroughbred or standardbred racing but common in  the quarter horse industry. The foal, by Streakin Six, is due in March but Dash  For Speed will carry her own future foals.    Blakeman credited a medicine to correct a thyroid deficiency in helping her as  both a racehorse and mother.    "She had no energy and her metabolism was down so we gave her the powder the  last two weeks to get her count back up," Blakeman said. "We had a hard time  getting her in foal at the beginning of the year too. We gave her the powder  and right away got an egg."    The American Quarter Horse Assn. will send out ballots to its 63-member racing  committee in early January to determine the world champion.    "I hope we have the good fortune of being chosen," Blakeman said after the  mare's 22nd victory in 30 starts.    "I like that she's won 10 Grade I stakes, three more than anybody else. She has  won three Grade I races this year, and has career earnings of $1.2 million  without ever winning the All-American Futurity. She set a track record winning  the Anne Burnett and a stakes record winning the Los Alamitos Championship this  summer. And she got rid of the myth that she could only win in New Mexico and  couldn't run at night."    History leans in Blakeman's favor. Eleven of 18 winners of the Champion of  Champions have gone on to be named world champion, including five of the last  six.    Los Alamitos' off-track business continues to grow. Canterbury Downs in  Minnesota and Les Bois Park in Idaho joined the network last month.    "The Capital District of New York, with 53 locations, should be next," James  Smith, executive vice president of the track, said.    "After that, we'll look to Montana and Mexico. When we hit $710,000 off-track  on Breeders Classic night (Nov. 17), I thought that would be high for the meet.  But we've gone over $750,000 since, and it looks like we'll hit $800,000 soon.    "We have 50 satellites now and will have 100 within two years," Smith said.    Los Alamitos Notes    Los Alamitos officials are trying to stage a $100,000 winner-take-all match  race between quarter horse Griswold and thoroughbred Valiant Pete on Jan. 11 or  12. Griswold set a world record of :44.07 for 870 yards this month. Valiant  Pete set a world mark of :49 1/5 for 4 1/2 furlongs (990 yards) this year.  Griswold, Gold Rush Derby winner Genuine Article and Breeders Marathon Classic  winner Six Figures are expected to head the lineup Friday in the $25,000  Katella Handicap at 870 yards.    Russell Harris, tied for sixth in the trainer standings with 13 victories, may  be in limbo for several weeks, since stewards barred him from entering horses  last week. A urine sample on Mighty Dasher, which finished fifth in the 10th  race Nov. 8 when Harris trained him, tested positive for cocaine. Harris  requested that the second part of the split sample be sent to another lab, in  this case Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. Stewards said they will schedule a  hearing when they obtain the result. Harris' previous record is clean.    Harness driver Billy Myer, who died in Delaware last week at 74, won the  American Trotting Classic at Hollywood Park in 1970 and '72 with Dayan. He also  won several major stakes in the 1960s with star pacer Romeo Hanover. . . . Dare  You To, runner-up in the American Pacing Classic at Los Alamitos and  fourth-place finisher in the Breeders Crown Aged Horse Pace, will become the  first North American horse to compete in New Zealand's grueling Inter-Dominion  Championship in March.    Trainer Lee Roy Heidelberg, who saddled runner-up Tee Roy Reb in the Champion  of Champions, managed a farm for actor Robert Mitchum in Atascadero from  1972-79. . . . Trainer H.L. Hooper, whose favored Heisajoy was bothered by  chain-reaction interference and finished sixth (placed fifth), refused to make  excuses after the Champion of Champions. "The mare was the better horse  tonight," said Hooper.    Trials are scheduled tonight for the $500,000 Golden State Futurity, the  richest race of the meet, Dec. 29.

headline:   NBA ROUNDUP;    BUCKS PASS PISTONS, 106-101   
text:   Coach Chuck Daly of the NBA champion Detroit Pistons thought he had an idea for  getting his club out of its worst slump in three years.    He had his team, which has shot poorly almost all season, come out firing at  Milwaukee Tuesday night, imitating a tactic that has worked for the Chicago  Bulls.    The Pistons jumped in front, 17-6, in the opening minutes, but couldn't handle  the long-range shooting of Jay Humphries and Ricky Pierce, losing again,  106-101, to the Bucks.    Milwaukee, the only team unbeaten at home, improved to 13-0 there, and  stretched its lead in the Central Division to 2 1/2 games over the slumping  Pistons.    It was the third loss in a row for Detroit and the seventh in the last eight  games.    Humphries had 13 of his career-high 36 points in the fourth quarter when the  Bucks outscored Detroit, 32-15, in the last 9:31 to pull it out. Pierce came  off the bench to get 12 of his 24 in the closing rally.    Joe Dumars had 19 points and James Edwards had 18 for the Pistons, but neither  scored in the fourth quarter. Edwards missed the previous loss with a pulled  muscle in his rib cage.    "We have to show patience to get out of this slump," Daly said. "I thought this  was the one, but then we flopped in the stretch.    "We're in a position to drop out of the race. We need a win."    They will try to end the slump against Chicago tonight in Detroit.    San Antonio 96, Houston 95 -- The two great centers, David Robinson and Akeem  Olajuwon, battled almost to a standstill. But Robinson enjoyed the meeting at  Houston most, because his two free throws with 23 seconds left decided the  game.    Robinson had 18 points and 13 rebounds. Olajuwon, the Rockets' star, had 20  points and 14 rebounds.    Olajuwon had two chances to be the hero. He had a 10-foot shot with eight  seconds left and it rimmed out. Then his driving layup at the buzzer was short.    Olajuwon, a six-year veteran, indicated before the game that he felt Robinson,  a second-year man, still needed to pay some dues.    Portland 122, Golden State 94 -- With Clyde Drexler getting 10 points in the  first quarter, the Trail Blazers took a 35-9 lead. They continued to build on  that, and by a minute into the second half it was 74-38.    The victory improved Portland's record to 22-2, best in the NBA.    Chicago 112, Miami 103 -- The Bulls failed to get off to their usual fast start  at Chicago, so Michael Jordan had to play more for his team to win its third in  a row.    It was the eighth loss in a row for the Heat, but Miami challenged the Bulls  throughout.    Jordan played 36 minutes and scored 39 points, 24 in the second half, to hold  off the Heat. Scottie Pippen made 11 of 17 shots, including a three-pointer,  and finished with 30 points in 41 minutes.    Phoenix 114, Dallas 95 -- The Suns stretched their unbeaten string since Xavier  McDaniel joined them to six games.    McDaniel had 23 points, but it was Dan Majerle, coming off the bench for 24,  who led the romp at Dallas.    Already missing their big man, Roy Tarpley, for the season, the Mavericks lost  Herb Williams for at least five games because of sore knees.    Utah 105, Charlotte 100 -- There isn't a team that enjoys playing against Karl  Malone. The Hornets really hate it.    Malone had 30 points and 17 rebounds as Utah won at Charlotte. In seven  previous meetings with the Hornets, the Mailman averaged 32 points.    Seattle 122, Orlando 105 -- The game was delayed almost an hour at Seattle  because the Magic was snowbound two miles from the Coliseum. Attendance was  listed as 1,568. Six inches of snow fell in the afternoon and early evening,  and traffic was stalled. The SuperSonics sold more than 10,000 tickets.    Derrick McKey had 33 points for the SuperSonics.    Sacramento 108, Minnesota 99 -- Anthony Bonner scored five of his 18 points in  a 9-2 run late in the game at Sacramento to assure the Kings their third win in  a row.    The Kings improved to 6-15, despite losing guard Bobby Hansen with a bone chip  in his left ankle. DAN HAFNER

headline:   FASHION;    NEGOTIATING STRATEGIES IN KIDS' STYLE WARS   
text:   Most preteen girls who shop at the Kids Mart in Burbank stop cold when they see  a certain outfit: a simple black dress with a matching jacket. Store manager  Jocelyn Neris said she hears many girls beg their parents to buy the suit for  holiday parties.    But the adults usually say no.    It's not the style, which is unadorned except for four gold buttons on the  jacket. "It's not the price," said Neris, who considers it a bargain at $23.95.  "It's the color."    An all-black outfit for a preteen doesn't win the hearts of mothers and fathers  -- even at holiday time. Such clothing disputes span the seasons, of course.  But they seem to peak during December, when parents must judge what is  appropriate to wear to holiday get-togethers and to give as Christmas or  Hanukkah gifts.    According to parents, children and salespeople, here are the items kids want  most and parents like least:    * All-black outfits.    * Bart Simpson T-shirts.    * Tights topped with miniskirts or long, loose-fitting tops ("dress-blouses").    * The pricey ($95 and up) PUMP line of Reebok kids' basketball shoes.    Disputes about these items can transform the jolliest soul into a Scrooge.  Salespeople -- the childless ones, anyway -- can pop an aspirin and forget  about it the minute they lock up for the day. But parents may be faced with  sullen silences or incessant begging for hours or days on end.    Nevertheless, such disputes are part and parcel of growing up, mental health  experts say. They are, in fact, a sign of normal, healthy development.    "About 40% of the teens and parents I see have some sort of issue with  clothing," said Dee Shepherd-Look, a Woodland Hills psychologist who  specializes in treating children and adolescents.    Underlying the warfare, whatever the season, is the child's attempt to become  an individual, said Dr. Alan Sandler, director of child psychiatry at Pine  Grove Hospital and Mental Health Center in Canoga Park. It's a paradoxical  process, Sandler acknowledges. "In becoming his own person, the child often  wears the same uniforms as everyone else."    The development of distinct clothing tastes -- even though they may be a carbon  copy of a best friend's -- reflects a child's growing independence, said Gary  Alan Fine, professor of sociology at the University of Georgia, Athens. It  means a child is "moving away from the family as the center of his existence"  and learning to reach out to peers. "That can be threatening to parents," Fine  said.    But compromises over clothing disputes are possible, according to experts. Some  parents agree, and describe the compromises they've made that keep the whole  family happy -- or at least on speaking terms.    Pat and Gary Emery of Los Angeles, for instance, set a $50 limit when their  11-year-old son Zack needs a new pair of athletic shoes.    "Anything above that, he can come up with the difference," explained Pat Emery.    When Marcia and Carl Skolnik's daughter Jessica, a seventh-grader, wanted black  tights with lace trim and a "baby-doll" dress, the parents balked, reasoning  that it looked too seductive. The neckline was much too far off-the-shoulder  for Marcia's taste. So the Burbank parents compromised: "She can wear the  off-the-shoulder baby doll top and tights to school as long as she wears a  turtleneck underneath," Marcia said.    Parents who don't like the tights-with-miniskirt look often talk their  daughters into wearing longer skirts, salespeople say.    And those who balk at the popular all-black dress in Kids Mart often persuade  their daughters to choose a similar style with a black-and-white polka dot top  instead, Neris said. Parents say it looks more childlike.    Parents in the midst of wars over Bart Simpson shirts often give a go-ahead to  some of the "milder messages" as a compromise. Or, salespeople say, they talk  their offspring into a shirt with a Raiders or other sports team logo.    Some parents admit they just give in -- budget allowing -- and buy whatever  clothing their offspring want. Some reason that's more economically sound over  the long term. Why buy a shirt your child hates, for instance, only to have it  hang in the closet until his arms grow longer than its sleeves?    Other parents don't cave in to a child's every clothing whim. But they are  reluctant to impose too many restrictions on clothing purchases, fearful of  repressing their child's need to express individuality. Pat Emery has this  guideline for her son, who wears school uniforms all week: "If the clothes he  wants say, 'I'm cool' or 'I'm different' I allow them. If they seem to say,  'I'm dangerous' or 'I'm sexy' I won't allow them."    Dave Cagle, a West Los Angeles free-lance writer, follows much the same  philosophy with his daughter Heather, 7. "A child's clothing is a way of  expressing herself," he say. He is liberal, with two exceptions: "If she wants  to wear something that's inappropriate for the weather -- like sweat pants to  the beach in July -- or if I think her attire is inappropriate for the  occasion, like wearing her jams and pink tank top to a wedding."    Understanding the dynamics behind a child's particular wardrobe wishes can help  parents decide when to refuse, when to compromise and when to give in.    Young fans of black clothing may be trying to look sophisticated, or may be  working their way through a rebellion phase. "Black clothing is  anti-authoritarian, because it started out as punk attire," said Shepherd-Look.  But all-black attire for children strikes fear in some parents, said  Shepherd-Look, because many equate it with the occult, gangs, witchcraft and  heavy-metal rock groups.    Bart Simpson fans are probably snarling their way through rebellion, too, said  Shepherd-Look, who is also a professor of psychology at Cal State Northridge.  The Simpson shirt messages (such as "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?")  express an inner child we all have, Shepherd-Look said. "And it's more socially  acceptable, in my opinion, to wear a Simpson shirt than to say 'bleep-bleep' to  a teacher."    Girls who ask for tights paired with an oversize, loose-fitting "baby-doll"  style blouse may be torn between their wishes to stay a child and society's  pressure to grow up and to look seductive. "The look is a contrast,"  Shepherd-Look observed. "The top is very childlike and feminine, loose-fitting.  The tights are very sexual."    PUMP fans enjoy a pretty transparent fantasy, said Walter Woods, an Atlanta  psychologist and consumer research consultant. They can be airborne. They can  be a great basketball star. They can be the next Michael Jordan.    "One fundamental fact about kids and dress is their desire to be affiliated  with a particular team or individual, a hero of some sort," Woods said. But  kids offer other reasons as well. Wearing PUMP shoes, they say, is bound to  impress classmates simply because they are new and expensive.    Even the most tuned-in parents might experience a guilt trip on the heels of a  shopping trip. "We remember the battles we had with our own parents, over such  fashions as bell-bottoms and miniskirts," Fine said. "On one hand, we want to  give in and say what we wish our parents would have said. But then practicality  sets in. And we begin to understand where our own parents were coming from."

headline:   MOVIE REVIEW;    'ALMOST' IS ALMOST A GOOD FILM   
text:   "Almost an Angel" (citywide) might just as well be called " 'Crocodile' Dundee  Gets Religion." As amiable as ever, lean and leathery Paul Hogan plays a career  criminal and electronics wizard who, fresh out of prison, assumes a hilariously  precise Willie Nelson impersonation and knocks over a bank. Before he can do a  repeat performance, this time disguised as Rod Stewart, he instinctively rushes  into oncoming traffic to shove a toddler to safety.    The next thing Hogan knows he's up in the clouds being interviewed by the Big  Probation Officer in the Sky, played to perfection in his silvery Moses mane  and beard by an unbilled Charlton Heston. In a stroke of inspiration, Hogan --  who is the film's writer as well as its executive producer -- keeps us guessing  whether he has actually died or has just dreamed he did, but fails to make  anything of the dilemma.    Indeed, after a lively and imaginative start, the film is downhill, a treacly  business about how Hogan, now on the lam, lands in Fillmore, where he comes to  the rescue of the dying young operator (Elias Koteas) of a recreation center  for latch-key kids and his acerbic sister (Linda Kozlowski). Koteas and  Kozlowski are likable, but their roles are pretty thankless.    The chronic dearth of family films, plus Hogan's undeniable laid-back appeal,  may work to the film's advantage over the holidays, but "Almost an Angel"  really belongs on the tube. It was produced and directed with warmth and  efficiency by John Cornell, who produced Hogan's Australian TV programs and  created with Hogan the Australian Tourist Commission's celebrated advertising  campaign for the United States.    To the filmmakers' credit they fill the film's countless small roles with  numerous minority actors and with such seasoned veterans as Doreen Lang (as  Koteas and Kozlowski's mother), Parley Baer and Hank Worden. "Almost an Angel"  (rated PG but G is more like it), which is enlivened by Maurice Jarre's  helpfully melodramatic score, is in the Christmas spirit but is a  disappointment in the wake of the "Crocodile" Dundee movies.
