headline:   ONLY IN L.A.   
text:   Most of Laurel Canyon Park off Mulholland Drive is now reserved for dogs, and  visiting humans have all the status of a fire hydrant.    While the Humane Society was holding a press conference there Thursday, a  canine crept up behind KABC (Channel 7) newsman Gene Gleeson, lifted up its leg  and sprayed him.    KNX radio reporter Diane Thompson, who was nearby, said she avoided the line of  fire because "I was keeping an eye on the dog."    Gleeson laughed off the incident, pointing out that the pooch missed most of  his leg. (Fortunately, TV reporters are generally seen from the waist up.)    And the impudent beast's owner? He or she never came forward.    How fierce is the competition in the real estate industry since the boom turned  into a bust? A publicist phoned to say that his client, a Beverly Hills real  estate agent, has taken to laminating his business cards so that he can pass  them out to bathers at the Beverly Hills Hotel swimming pool.    Sad.    Florida's lack of originality apparently knows no bounds.    The Sunshine State, as you know, has built imitations of Disneyland, the  Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Brown Derby and the Universal Studio Tour.  Recently, claiming to have discovered Medflies, it began a malathion-spraying  campaign.    Here's the topper: Federal prosecutors are now investigating the Miami Beach  mayor's dealings with a banker -- even before the end of the federal  investigation of our own Mayor Bradley's dealings with various financial  institutions.    No doubt Florida will soon have its own Malathion Poetry Contest, too. In the  meantime, Only in L.A.'s panel of distinguished judges gave this week's award  to Jeff Williamson of Sherman Oaks, who doused us with the following:    There must be citizens who feel     It's time to change the City Seal:     Let's add two Medflies to the rim     (The female making eyes at him!).     Williamson, who also submitted the seal, says the phrase at the bottom is "an  old heraldic way of saying, 'Enough already, no more spraying.' "    Great Inventions That Never Quite Caught On:    Fifty years ago, long before the advent of electronic turn signals for cars,  Westways magazine reported the development of a product called Arm-A-Lite.    It was a device that fit into the corner of the driver's window. The inventor's  idea, Westways said, was that when the driver made an arm signal to turn, his  arm would automatically hit a light switch. Then, a light would throw "a beam  on his arm, making it visible."    More evidence that the safe-sex campaign is gaining followers:    A woman's purse was stolen while she was paying for gasoline in Glassell Park.  The purse was found a week later on the roof of a neighboring McDonald's. The  only thing missing was a pack of condoms.      miscelLAny:    Remember the days when vandalism of bus benches amounted to an occasional  mustache added to a drawing? A city survey recently found that 75% of L.A.'s  6,700 benches had been defaced.

headline:   HE'S SEEN ERROR OF HIS WAYS;    ANGELS: FINLEY THROWS AWAY BUNT IN MARINERS' SEVEN-RUN FOURTH AND SEATTLE GOES  ON TO SCORE A 10-8 VICTORY.   
text:   Everything seemed in place for the Angels Thursday night. They had what they  always seem to be wanting -- a leadoff man and a lead.    They had Luis Polonia batting first, in his first start as an Angel. They  scored their first two runs on no hits, and led by four before the Mariners  batted a second time.    And on the mound they had Chuck Finley, the left-hander with a 0.96 earned-run  average.    The Angels seemed on their way to their third victory in a row. Instead, they  found themselves without one of the few things that seemed certain -- a steady  outing by Finley, who fell apart in the Angels' 10-8 loss to Seattle in front  of 12,279 in the Kingdome.    "I'll take full responsibility for the loss," said Finley, who fell to 3-2.  "The guys busted their . . . for me. They spotted me four runs. I'm not going  to sit and make excuses. I stunk. I feel bad."    Three more Angel errors -- raising their total to 19 -- played a large part in  the loss. One of them belonged to Finley, and it was the one that did him in.    He took a 6-3 lead into the Mariners' half of the fourth. But he left without  getting the first out of an inning that became a seven-run barrage, topped by  Jeff Leonard's second 400-foot homer of the game, a three-run shot off Scott  Bailes.    Finley walked the first two batters in the fourth, then gave up a run-scoring  single to Dave Valle. With runners on first and second, Mike Brumley bunted.  Finley fielded the ball within a few feet of the third-base line, but his throw  to first sailed past first baseman Wally Joyner. Darnell Coles and Valle raced  around the bases, Valle scoring ahead of Dante Bichette's throw.    That tied the score, 6-6, and Bailes relieved Finley, who eventually was  charged with seven runs, four of them earned.    Brumley, who had gone to second on Finley's error, was sacrificed to third by  Harold Reynolds, and scored when shortstop Donnie Hill was charged with an  error on Henry Cotto's grounder. Bailes walked Ken Griffey Jr., bringing up  Leonard.    "He kind of got me out of my game," said Bailes, saying that Leonard's first  home-run trot and his stalling had irritated him. "He stands a lot, too."    Leonard took a ball, and then sent a high fastball into the left-field stands,  a three-run homer that gave him two in a game for the seventh time in his  career, and tied his career-high of five RBIs.    "I go out and try to pitch like Nolan Ryan, and he does the same thing to me,"  Bailes said.    Bailes went four innings, giving up three runs, two of them earned, on three  hits. Together, he and Finley walked six batters, three each, and Seattle's six  pitchers walked seven.    Finley's shining earned-run average of 0.96 took on a decided tarnish, soaring  to 2.03. His record fell to 3-2.    He had not given up a home run all season, until Leonard's shot in the third  inning, which was estimated to have traveled 435 feet.    Unlike the team, Finley had not traveled overnight from Baltimore for the game  in Seattle, the first of six games the Angels must make up because of the  lockout. Instead, he traveled Wednesday afternoon in order to be rested.    Seattle starter Matt Young had the same option to travel from Boston, but chose  to come with the team.    The game began with the Mariners' starting pitcher struggling. The Angels  scored two runs on Young without getting a hit, putting together two walks and  two errors with a fielder's choice.    The Angels scored two again in the second, when Hill's double drove in Johnny  Ray, who had doubled, and Rick Schu, who singled.    The Mariners scored a run in the third when Darnell Coles doubled, driving in  O'Brien, who had singled.    Leonard's two-run homer in the third made it 4-3, but the Angels scored two  more runs in fourth on two walks and Devon White's two-run single.    Young left after three-plus innings, allowing six runs, four of them earned, on  four hits.    Rookie Brent Knackert, the second of six Seattle pitchers, earned his first  major league victory by giving up only one hit over two innings. Knackert, a  product of Ocean View High in Huntington Beach, made his first major league  appearance in front of his home fans at Anaheim Stadium last month.    The Angels mounted a rally in the eighth inning. Jack Howell, batting for Schu,  led off with a homer to right, his second. They added another run when Joyner's  two-out single to right drove in Polonia, who had singled and stole second.    Seattle ace Mike Schooler relieved, and Chili Davis' double to right put  runners on second and third. But Bichette lined out to left to end the inning  with the Angels still trailing, 10-8.    Schooler picked up the save, his sixth, by retiring the Angels in order in the  ninth.    Polonia's play in his role as the man who has relieved White of pressure to  lead off was the most encouraging aspect of the evening for the Angels, who  finished their longest road trip of the season with a 5-8 record.    Polonia started in left and went two for three. His repertoire included some  quality leadoff plays: He walked to open the game and later scored, he  sacrificed, and he stole a base.    "For the first time this year, I feel like I'm playing baseball," Polonia said.  "Before with the Yankees, I didn't. I can't wait (to play the Yankees). I've  got something for them. But I've got good control of myself."    "I thought he did a very good job," Manager Doug Rader said. "I'm happy for  Luis. He did a lot of things."    Angel Notes    The Seattle Fire Department was called to the Angels' hotel Thursday after an  alarm was pulled in a hallway when smoke was detected outside a player's room.  The player, whom neither the Angels nor the hotel would identify, had been  burning some papers in a trash can. Bert Blyleven, the usual suspect, was not  involved, an Angel spokesman said. "I heard the alarm and checked my room,"  said Blyleven, who has been known to set shoelaces on fire. "It wasn't me."    Johnny Ray's second-inning double was the 21st game in a row in which the  Angels have a double, equaling the team record. . . . Shortstop Dick Schofield  ran at about 50% Thursday, and continues to take ground balls and batting  practice. The Angels hope Schofield, recovering from a hamstring injury, will  be ready for his first appearance of the season in 10 to 14 days.

headline:   AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;    BLOWERS, YANKEES AT A LOSS   
text:   Mike Blowers of the New York Yankees might have been able to make sense of it  if the balls hit toward him Thursday were line drives, choppers or perfectly  executed drag bunts.    But Blowers, a rookie, tied an American League record for errors by a third  baseman when he failed to come up with four routine ground balls in the  Yankees' 10-5 loss to the Cleveland Indians in New York.    "It's not like I flubbed four hard-hit balls," Blowers said. "I'm still trying  to figure out what happened."    Blowers joined 20 other third basemen in the record book by committing two  errors in the seventh inning, one in the eighth and one in the ninth. The last  AL third baseman to commit four errors in a game was Floyd Rayford of the  Baltimore Orioles in 1986.    David Brain of the Boston Braves set the modern major league record for errors  by a third baseman when he committed five in 1906.    "I just couldn't find any kind of rhythm, couldn't get comfortable," Blowers  said. "I guess it's just one of those days, one of those things."    As a result of Blowers' errors, the Indians scored four unearned runs in the  seventh, one in the eighth and two in the ninth to hand the Yankees their fifth  consecutive loss.    Blowers was acquired by the Yankees in August from the Montreal Expos in a  trade for John Candelaria. He made four errors in 13 games with the Yankees  last season and had only two errors this season before Thursday's game.    "The kid just had a rough day," Yankee Manager Bucky Dent said. "I feel for  him. I'm not going to rip him. We all make errors. He just made a bunch all at  one time."    Sandy Alomar drove in five runs on three hits, including a tie-breaking,  two-run double in the eighth that gave the Indians a 7-5 lead.    Jesse Orosco (1-1), the Indians' fourth pitcher, got the victory, and Doug  Jones earned his eighth save.    Yankee reliever Jeff Robinson (0-1), who gave up two runs on three hits in the  seventh, took the loss.    Minnesota 3, Detroit 1 -- The Tigers led the major leagues with 103 losses last  season. They're on track to do the same this year.    Gary Gaetti's two-run homer in the 10th inning at Detroit extended the Tigers'  losing streak to five games and left them last in the East with an 8-15 record  -- the same mark they had last season after 23 games.    Mike Henneman (0-2) walked Kirby Puckett to lead off the 10th before Gaetti hit  his fourth home run. Gaetti, who had two three-run homers Wednesday night, hit  an 0-and-1 pitch from Henneman over the left-field wall.    Allan Anderson gave up one run on six hits in eight innings before he was  replaced by Terry Leach (2-0), who pitched a scoreless ninth for the victory.    Rick Aguilera pitched the 10th and earned his fifth save.    Milwaukee 9, Kansas City 5 -- Robin Yount's three-run, inside-the-park homer at  Kansas City paced the Brewers and dropped the Royals to 6-14, the worst record  in the major leagues.    Yount, who has half the 12 inside-the-park homers in Brewers history, chased  Mark Gubicza (1-4) with his homer in the fourth.    Jamie Navarro (1-0) went five innings to earn the win.    Dan Plesac earned his fourth save.

headline:   NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;    ARMSTRONG WINS FIFTH, REDS GET A 5-0 VICTORY OVER METS   
text:   Jack Armstrong joined some elite company Thursday night at New York with  another outstanding performance for the Cincinnati Reds.    Armstrong, a right-hander who was the Reds' No. 1 draft choice in 1987, pitched  7 2/3 innings and earned his fifth victory as the Reds beat the Mets, 5-0, for  their eighth victory in 10 road games.    Armstrong (5-0), Mets' left-hander Frank Viola and Oakland right-hander Dave  Stewart are the only five-game winners in the major leagues.    "I pitched pretty good I guess," said Armstrong, who allowed four hits, struck  out three and walked one. "I didn't overpower anyone."    He didn't have to against the error-prone Mets, who have lost five of their  last six and committed 27 errors in 22 games.    Howard Johnson made three errors, tying his club record for shortstops set on  July 18, 1985.    Joe Oliver keyed the Reds' offense with his first two home runs.    Former Met Randy Myers pitched 2 1/3 innings for his fifth save.    Houston 10, Philadelphia 3 -- Bill Gullickson pitched a strong game at  Philadelphia as the Astros beat the Phillies.    Gullickson (2-1), who was signed as a free agent last December after he went  21-14 in two seasons with the Yomiuri Giants in Japan, pitched 7 1/3 innings  and surrendered six hits to the Phillies, who had 20 hits Wednesday night in a  14-4 victory over the Astros.    Gullickson struck out four, walked three and never trailed after Ken Caminiti  hit a two-run single off Terry Mulholland (1-1) in the first inning.    Caminiti had three runs batted in.    Len Dykstra had four hits and Carmelo Martinez hit his third homer for the  Phillies.    Atlanta 4, Montreal 1 -- The Braves scored three runs in the ninth at Montreal  and extended their winning streak to five games.    Left-hander Tom Glavine pitched seven innings, giving up only a bunt single to  Otis Nixon.    Charlie Kerfeld (2-1) pitched a scoreless eighth to earn the victory. Joe  Boever pitched the ninth for his second save.    Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd had his best game since joining the Expos as a free agent  last winter, giving up six hits and striking out five in six innings.

headline:   DAUGHERTY SCORES 34 AS CAVALIERS EVEN SERIES WITH 76ERS;    NBA PLAYOFFS: CENTER IS ALMOST PERFECT IN 108-96 VICTORY. 76ERS WILL TRY TO WIN  SERIES AT HOME.   
text:   Anyone wondering why the Cleveland Cavaliers struggled early this season need  only glance at Brad Daugherty's line in Thursday night's box score.    Daugherty, who missed the first half of the season because of complications  after foot surgery, was nearly perfect. He went 12 of 15 from the floor, 10 of  12 from the free-throw line and scored a team playoff-record 34 points as the  Cavaliers beat the Philadelphia 76ers, 108-96, tying their Eastern Conference  quarterfinal series 2-2.    The deciding game will be Saturday in Philadelphia.    "We shot the ball poorly, and Brad Daugherty had a career night,"  Philadelphia's Charles Barkley said. "We've got to do something to shut him  down. We didn't double him tonight and he's too good not to double. We've got  to go back to the drawing board."    Cleveland was counting on a strong playoff series from Daugherty, who appears  to be hitting his stride after sitting out the first half.    "It felt like last year a little bit," Daugherty said. "The foot is really  coming around. I'm starting to get my strength back in it. But I think I'm at a  disadvantage, too, because I think I'm behind everybody else. I was in the  hospital two months."    Daugherty made 10 of his first 11 shots from the field. Mark Price set a  Cavalier playoff record with 18 assists. Daugherty also grabbed nine rebounds.    "He must have made four or five jump shots when we were helping pick up Price  on the drive," Philadelphia Coach Jim Lynam said. "Daugherty had a great game."    The two teams split their four regular-season games, each winning once at home  and once on the road. Each has won its two home games in the playoffs.    The Cavaliers shut down the 76ers in the fourth quarter, outscoring them,  22-14. The 76ers went scoreless from the field for seven minutes as Cleveland  widened an 89-84 lead early in the quarter to 97-85 with five minutes left.    Daugherty finished off the 8-1 flurry with a short hook shot and two free  throws.    As has been the case in all four playoff games, the Cavaliers got off to a  quick start, leading 34-23 after one quarter and 60-50 at halftime.    Cleveland let two halftime leads slip away in Philadelphia, but made the next  two stand up at home.    Barkley scored 23 points and had 11 rebounds. Hawkins scored 22, but only two  in the fourth quarter.

headline:   SUCCESS RELATIVE FOR DUO;    TENNIS: MOORPARK COLLEGE'S MOTHER-AND-DAUGHTER COMBINATION MAKES FOR A WINNING  SET.   
text:   Watching Moorpark College's No. 1 doubles team play is sort of like seeing  those old soap commercials -- look at their backhands and decide which player  is the mother and which is the daughter.    Their relationship isn't always apparent to opponents, but it quickly becomes  clear the first time Elise Nakawatase looks at Patti Nakawatase and says, "Nice  shot, Mom."    This unlikely pairing of college freshmen, a 45-year-old mother and her  18-year-old daughter, was as unexpected as it has been successful.    Patti, who never had competed in school-based athletics, already was planning  to take some classes at Moorpark when Elise asked her to join a tennis team  badly in need of players.    "I didn't really realize what I got into," Patti said.    Patti and Elise have been more than a novelty, winning seven of their 11  doubles matches. In singles, Patti is 8-1 at No. 6, and Elise is 9-6 at No. 1.    Their doubles team is among those receiving a first-round bye for the Western  State Conference tournament, which begins today and continues through Sunday at  Santa Barbara.    "It's been a little hectic and stressful, but I've enjoyed doing it," said  Patti, who didn't go on to college after graduating from Venice High in 1962.  "It's been fun to play with them. They're all so nice, but they hit so hard and  never get tired."    Patti and Elise had played together before, usually when Patti needed a  substitute for her social matches, but Elise played parent-child tournaments  with her father. As might be expected, mother and daughter have a certain  kinship on the court.    Elise's powerful strokes and speed complement Patti's doubles acumen. Playing  in three club leagues as well as frequent doubles matches with friends has left  Patti versed in the nuances of doubles play, recondite knowledge for college  players accustomed to singles.    "They play well together," Moorpark Coach Nancy Stewart said. "Patti knows the  court real well. Elise is very athletic."    Patti's specialties are poaches, lobs and off-speed shots, but Elise says her  mother hits the ball hard enough that "I know I don't have to worry about  getting the ball slammed in my face.    "What I like is my mom can hold her own most of the time," Elise said. "I know  they tend to pick on her more because she's the older one, but my mom pretty  much shows them."    Elise and Patti recently showed their moxie against WSC power Santa Barbara.  After falling behind, 4-1, Nakawatase and Nakawatase battled back to win the  first set, 7-6, and the match, 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (6-8), 6-0.    "I feel good on the court with her because she'll hold up her end and sometimes  mine," Patti said. "We get along better on the court than we do anywhere else.    "When we're on the court, we're partners, but anywhere else it's  mother-daughter."    The two are amicable on the court, with each other and their opponents. Their  relaxed demeanor and easy friendliness are a departure from the days when Elise  wouldn't let her mother watch her juniors matches because having Patti on the  sidelines made her too nervous.    "We've gotten closer now since we've been playing," Elise said. "We have more  to talk about now. Before we didn't get along as well."    This spring, Patti and Elise have metaphorically walked a mile in each other's  Nikes.    Elise now has to cook some meals for her father and younger brother because  Patti has night classes, and Patti better appreciates Elise's life as a  student.    "I think it's made us understand each other much better," Elise said.  "Personality-wise I'd say we're about the same. Attitude-wise and study  habit-wise we're different."    "She's more organized. Me, I take it as it comes."    The most difficult aspect of college athletics for Patti has been fitting all  the time demands into her schedule.    Patti juggles her 12-hour class load, which she needs to stay eligible for  athletics, with a 15-hour-a-week job at a Westlake Village accounting firm and  with keeping the family's Agoura Hills household humming.    In addition, she has standing commitments for several matches a week in leagues  and with friends.    Too busy to practice with the team, Patti said she nonetheless feels  comfortable on the squad.    "She's a lot of fun," said Amy Perry, a member of Moorpark's No. 2 doubles  team. On trips, "she always sits up front with the coach, and they usually talk  the whole time. The other girls sit and gossip, and they talk 'mom-stuff.' "    Cathleen Clark, another member of the No. 2 doubles team, admitted the players  sometimes "have to watch what we say; we kind of whisper sometimes," but added,  "She's just like one of the girls."    Yet Patti has a different perspective on college athletics than the rest of the  team.    Elise hopes to parlay her Moorpark experience into a spot on a four-year  college team, but for Patti, the experience has been an end unto itself.    Patti says she would have to quit her job to play next season, a sacrifice  she's not eager to make. She's still concentrating on completing this season,  which could last into mid-May.    If Elise and Patti win their first WSC tournament match, they'll be in the  final eight, which will automatically qualify them for the Southern California  regional of the state tournament.    If they do advance to regionals, which begin next Friday, they'll have to be  considered dark-horse contenders.    The last day of the regionals is, after all, Mother's Day.

headline:   UNDEFEATED SOUTH, WEST TORRANCE WANT CLEAR SKIES FOR SHOWDOWN;    PREP SOFTBALL: OCEAN LEAGUE RIVALS HAVE HAD THREE GAMES RAINED OUT THIS SEASON.  THEY WILL TRY AGAIN TODAY AND MONDAY.   
text:   With the Ocean League title on the line, how badly do the softball teams at  South Torrance and West Torrance high schools want to play each other?    Enough to stay out in the rain all day if they have to.    The rivals, tied for first place with 10-0 records, had their first scheduled  game rained out April 4. Two later games were also washed away.    They actually made it into the third inning Monday at South before umpires,  fearing injuries and heeding the calls of drenched parents and fans, called off  the scoreless game. Despite a heavy downpour and chilly winds, players from  both sides begged to have the game continue.    "It's not going to get any worse," pleaded one player whose spirit clearly  wasn't dampened. "Let's keep going."    "Come on, it's not raining that hard," said another.    Once the game was called off, complaints were heard on both sides, although the  fans let out grateful cheers before dashing for the parking lot.    "We don't care if it's raining or not. We just really want to play them," said  West freshman designated hitter Nicole Hendrix, who is hitting .319 and leads  the Warriors with two home runs. "We've been really up for them.    "Monday, it was raining really hard, but we were feeling good."    South junior shortstop Gillian Boxx said her team shares the excitement. She  said she was nervous for the first time in her career before Monday's game  because "they're such important games coming up. Everyone is waiting to see who  is going to be in first place."    The revised schedule has the two teams playing at West today and at South on  Monday in 3 p.m. games.    South and West played once early this season, in the Hawthorne Tournament.  South won, 4-0, behind the pitching of sophomore Jacqueline Brown (9-1), but  neither team attaches much significance to that meeting, since each was without  key players who were still playing basketball or soccer.    Brown will start Friday against Warrior senior Rosa Olloque (10-0), who has  tossed shutouts in seven of her last eight games. Spartan senior Julie DeJaifre  (2-1), who missed most of the season with a broken left foot, will start  against Olloque on Monday.    The return of DeJaifre, South's lone senior, could be crucial down the stretch,  second-year Coach Larry Lent said.    "I have a good one-two combination, and I always have a backup," said Lent,  whose team is 13-2 overall. "West High has an excellent pitcher in Rosa, but  they don't have a backup if something happens.    "If there is some trouble, I won't hesitate to make a change. (West) doesn't  have that luxury."    Indeed, the Spartans are confident coming into the crucial two-game series.  After outscoring league opponents, 99-3, they have a right to be. Also, South  has won two straight league crowns (Bay in 1988, Ocean in 1989) and features a  two-time league MVP in Boxx. Five Spartans are hitting .378 or better, led by  Boxx (.578, four home runs, 20 RBIs, 13 stole bases).    West Coach Jim Carrico, who has guided the Warriors to a 13-4 overall mark,  admits that South has a more dominant offense.    "We've been playing pressure ball all year," he said. "We don't blow anybody  away.    "We win 1-0, 2-0. We beat Morningside 4-0, and everybody else had beaten them  20-0."    But Carrico -- who lost his best hitter, senior first baseman Jennifer Mills  (.375), for the season with a broken right arm last month -- has three .300  hitters in his lineup and says his team makes good contact. "But we haven't had  the breaks," he said. "We've been hitting the ball right at people."    Carrico went on to say that South doesn't give West the respect it deserves.    "Our feeling is that they talk about how they're peaking and they're the team  to beat," he said. "But I think it's great (because) it's inspiring."    Some of his players have taken South's perceived cocky attitude more seriously.    "They want to beat us bad," said Hendrix, West's clean-up hitter. "And we want  to beat them bad.    "But they've been bringing bad things into it, and we just want a good, clean  game. They're saying that now that (DeJaifre) is back that they're going to get  us, and I don't think that's right. I guess she's supposed to be really hot  stuff.    "Personally, I didn't think she was that great. She is a good pitcher, but  nothing we haven't faced against Redondo or (Mira) Costa."    West shortstop Brigit Tapp, who is hitting .375 in the lead-off spot, added:  "We're getting more eager to play (South). They say they're peaking and ready,  but they haven't given us our respect. We're undefeated too. It'll just come  down to who gets the breaks."    Boxx, South's team leader for three years, said the Spartans also are getting  tired of all the talk leading up to the showdown. "It does make you want to  kind of just get it over with," she said.    Lent said it's understandable that tension is getting to players on both teams.  "We're just all up-tight," he explained.    Lent thinks both teams will fare well in the Southern Section 3-A playoffs that  start in less than two weeks. He also said that although Olloque is "hittable,"  she is an excellent pitcher, one of the best in Southern California.    For South, Boxx is especially important in critical games because of her  experience on national traveling teams. She has a calming effect on the whole  team, Lent said.    "She never feels pressure, or at least she never shows it," he said. "There are  times in critical situations where I'll turn to her and ask her what she  thinks.    "I can learn from her experiences and take some of the knowledge she has picked  up from other coaches."    Boxx said she accepts her role as a clutch player: "I know that a lot of times  I have to be the one to drive in runs."    She said she takes a simple approach to hitting. "I just try to keep the ball  out of the air," she said. "If I hit a grounder or a line drive, I feel like  I'm doing my job."    Helping Boxx produce runs for the Spartans are freshman third baseman Nicole  Odom (.418), junior catcher Deirdre Baker (.406), freshman designated hitter  Rachel Bosma (.400) and junior first baseman Monica Emmrich (.378, 14 stolen  bases).    Sophomore left fielder Beth Tapp (.340), joins sister Brigit and Hendrix as  West's offensive leaders. But, of course, big offensive production isn't the  Warriors' forte.    "Defense is our strength," Carrico said. "It's been keeping us in games all  year."    Olloque, who has a 0.22 ERA and averages less than two walks per game,  recognizes that strength, the coach said.    "Rosa throws strikes and makes them put it in play," Carrico said. "Don't get  me wrong; she has over 100 strikeouts. But she doesn't have to be a big  strikeout pitcher all the time."    Carrico calls Brigit Tapp "the backbone of the defense," but he said senior  catcher Mary Litzenberg is the true field general. "She's in charge out there,"  he said. "And Rosa and everyone else listen to what she says.    "After working with me for a couple of years, she knows how I think and what I  want."    All West and South want this afternoon are are sunny skies, a dry field,  respect and first place.

headline:   JC NOTES;    NEW COACH PUTS EL CAMINO IN THE SWIM FOR STATE MEET   
text:   Corey Stanbury, El Camino College's enthusiastic swimming and water polo coach,  has proven that with enough dedication, any program can be upgraded in a short  time.    In only his second season as head coach, Stanbury has made contenders out of  the once-ailing El Camino men's and women's swim teams.    In last week's South Coast Conference meet at Golden West College, the El  Camino men finished second and the women third. Seven Warriors -- two divers  and five swimmers -- qualified for the state meet, which started Thursday at  Mt. San Antonio College and ends Saturday.    Last season only one El Camino swimmer, Todd Douglas, and three divers  qualified for the state meet.    Douglas, an all-American last year, will compete in the 100- and 200-yard  breaststroke and the 400-yard medley relay. Sophomore Dan Wilkinson qualified  in the 500- and 1,650-yard freestyle, the 200 freestyle relay and the 400  medley.    Palos Verdes High freshman Scott Peppard will compete in both relays and the  50-yard freestyle. Freshman Bill Johnston will swim the last leg of the 200  freestyle relay.    The only woman swimmer to qualify is Nicole Standardi, a sophomore from Rolling  Hills High. Her outstanding performances in the 50-, 100- and 200-yard  freestyle have earned her spots in all three races at Mt. SAC this weekend.    "I think we're poised to do quite well," Stanbury said. I think both men and  women can finish in the top 10."    Stanbury is also confident in his two divers, freshmen Michelle Zimmer and Ed  Bangaster. Both have qualified on the one- and three-meter boards. Zimmer is  from North Torrance High, Bangaster from St. Bernard.    Though it won't be official until after next week's Southern California  Championships, it appears that El Camino is sending at least five athletes to  Santa Barbara for the state track meet May 18-19.    On the women's side, Sharette Garcia is a sure bet in the 800 and 1,500 meters  unless unexpected injuries hamper her. The petite sophomore from Belize is the  defending 800-meter state champion and the state runner-up at 1,500 meters. She  was also on El Camino's championship 4 x 400 relay team last year.    This season Garcia's marks in the 800 and 1,500 rank among the state's best. At  last weekend's SCC meet she swept the 1,500 in 4:49.56 and the 800 in 2:16.68.    Diana Tracy also had impressive performances at the conference meet in Walnut.  The 37 year-old won both the 3,000 and the 5,000 meters. Her 17:27.00 mark in  the 5,000 set a new league and school record. It's also a personal best for the  freshman from Hermosa Beach.    "We have a lot of quality athletes," said El Camino assistant coach Dean  Lofgren, "but unfortunately we don't have much depth."    That mostly applies to the field events, though Tiesha Holmes leads Southern  California in the long jump and triple jump. The freshman won both events at  Mt. SAC with marks of 18 feet, 8 1/2 inches in the long jump and 37 1/2 feet in  the triple jump.    The El Camino men also have a pair of leapers who should qualify for the  championships in Santa Barbara. Sophomores Ron Martin and Curtis Mitchell rank  among the state's best in their events. Last week Martin broke the SCC long  jump record with a leap of 25 feet, 1 inch.    Mitchell leads the state in the triple jump. He swept that event at the  conference finals with a mark of 52 feet, 5 1/2 inches. Coach Bill Moreno says  Mitchell is being highly recruited by top schools such as Louisiana State  University and UCLA.    SCC track coaches couldn't decide on a conference athlete of the year when they  met Wednesday, so they took the easy way out and picked four. Garcia, Tracy,  Jakki Henderson and Crystal Irbing were named co-athletes of the year in the  conference. Henderson is a sprinter at Mt. SAC, and Irbing is a sprinter at  Long Beach City College.    There's nothing new about Harbor College's baseball team making it to the  playoffs, this year's club is even more impressive than usual. The Seahawks,  41-5, have broken the school record for victories in a season.    Granted, Harbor is in a weak league, but the Seahawks also have solid  tournament victories over top-notch teams such as defending state champion  Cerritos.    Remarkably, the Harbor players have managed to get pumped up for all 19 games  they have played in the six-member Southern California Athletic Conference,  despite the lack of competition. They finished league play 19-0.    How much of a cakewalk has it been? Only one regular starter -- center fielder  Mike Murphy -- played in Harbor's last conference game, against Barstow on  April 26, and the Seahawks still won, 13-3. Coach Jim O'Brien, sure there was  nothing to worry about, was at a coaches' meeting in San Francisco while his  reserves nailed Barstow.    The playoffs should provide more excitement for the confident Seahawks.  Post-season action starts May 11 against a team yet to be determined.    At the state championship tournament, scheduled May 25-27 at UC Irvine, Harbor  looks as if it's equipped to improve on last year's third-place finish.

headline:   COLLEGE NOTES;    BENEFITS OF THE BIG TIME: LOYOLA TO PLAY IN MAUI   
text:   Loyola Marymount basketball hit the big time in the recent NCAA Tournament and  is starting to reap some of the benefits, as evidenced by the Lions' invitation  to a prestigious season-opening tournament next fall.    The Lions will play in the eight-team Chaminade Maui Classic in Hawaii. And in  a field that includes national powers Syracuse and Indiana, Loyola is being  played up as one of the marquee names.    "Loyola Marymount has been the Cinderella team this year, and I consider it a  feather in our cap to have such an exciting team opening their season with us,"  said Chaminade Athletic Director Mike Vasconcellos.    The Maui Classic, held in the Lahaina Civic Center, annually brings together a  national field for the season-opening weekend. Missouri beat Oklahoma in last  year's championship game, and eventual NCAA champ Michigan beat defending champ  Kansas the year before. This year's games will be played Nov. 23-24-25,  starting the day after Thanksgiving.    The field also includes Iowa State, Northeastern, host Chaminade and Loyola  conference foe Santa Clara. Arkansas-Little Rock pulled out after Coach Mike  Newell left and has been replaced by the University of Toledo.    A television package is being worked out, and Vasconcellos said opening  matchups should be set within a month -- with television having some input. (He  said Loyola and Santa Clara won't be put in the same bracket.) TV has found the  fast-breaking Lions to its liking the last two years, when Loyola set national  scoring records in both seasons.    Vasconcellos said another factor favored Loyola's selection. "We always have to  have a Catholic school in the field," he said. "Us Catholic schools have to  stick together."    In fact, Chaminade, a Catholic institution with an enrollment similar to  Loyola's, is planning to upgrade its program to Division I and has made  inquiries to the West Coast Conference about joining sometime in the 1990s.    In playing host to the tournament, Chaminade has even pulled off some major  upsets. "It's more of a spectacle than a tournament," Vasconcellos said.  "There's golf, a luau. We provide the sun, the surf, and try to sneak up on  somebody.    "Winning and losing is almost incidental. It's really a cultural event. The  players love it. It's a great way to start the season. It's like spring  training -- the kids are fresh; they get to interact with the other teams. When  (Coach) Rollie Massimino came out with Villanova, he set an all-time golf  record for a basketball coach. And let's face it, if you're gonna lose, you  might was well lose in Hawaii. It beats losing in North Dakota."    Close Shave: It's been a banner year for Loyola Marymount women's tennis. In  fact, one might say the Lions have been razor sharp.    For 16 years, tennis Coach Jamie Sanchez has been telling his teams that if  they could finish as high as third in the West Coast Conference, he would shave  his beard and mustache. (He doesn't worry about finishing first because  perennial winners Pepperdine and San Diego grant tennis scholarships. The other  teams in the conference don't.)    Well, the Lions finally placed third in the conference tournament two weeks  ago, and Sanchez began getting calls from former players and alumni. "So I went  ahead and (shaved)," Sanchez said, laughing. "Now everybody tells me I look  younger, so it might be a benefit."    The Lions' top gun was junior Lynn Stogner, who recently won the No. 1 singles  title in the independent division at the Ojai Tournament. She lived up to her  top seeding, winning all four matches and defeating UC San Diego's Kristine  Bahrens in the final, 6-3, 7-6. Stogner was the Lions' top player despite a  season-long wrist injury that was scheduled for surgery today.    Sanchez's Lions also won the doubles title at Ojai behind freshman Kim Florez  and senior Jori Stinar, giving Loyola the team title in the Intercollegiate  Independent category.    The Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball team continues to struggle in the  California Collegiate Athletic Conference, but third baseman Fred Camarena  still has a chance to break the team batting record.    The Toros, 17-21-2 overall, lost to UC Riverside, 5-0, earlier this week and  take a 8-16 CCAA record into today's 3 p.m. home game against Cal Poly Pomona.    Camarena, however, hit in his 11th straight game against Riverside to raise his  season average to .404. With eight games to play, Camarena is hoping to become  the second Toro to hit .400, and is shooting for Ruben Jauregui's 1988 record  of .406.    Since dropping to his season low of .365 on April 7, the senior from Brea has  steadily raised his average to its current mark. In his 11-game streak Camarena  has hit .500 (19 for 38).    Stat of the Week: When the Loyola Marymount baseball team was beaten by Long  Beach State, 5-0, on Tuesday, it was the first time the Lions had been blanked  this season and the first time in 107 games. The last team to shut out the  Lions was Long Beach State in February, 1989.

headline:   NAIA DISTRICT 3 SOFTBALL TOURNAMENT;    CAL LUTHERAN ARMED WITH STRONG PITCHING   
text:   Cal Lutheran will rely on the one-two pitching punch of Dee Andra Pilkington  and Leslie Stevens in seeking its third consecutive appearance in the National  Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics softball finals.    Pilkington (15-6, 1.04 earned-run average), a senior right-hander, and Stevens  (12-4, 1.46 ERA), a junior right-hander, give Cal Lutheran an unusually deep  and well-balanced staff.    "That's one of the advantages we'll have going into this district (playoff) is  that both pitchers' arms are not tired," Cal Lutheran Coach Tony Venditto said.  "We can play back to back (or) we can play two or three games in one day and  not hurt us."    The Regals (29-10-2, 14-2 in district play) are making their sixth consecutive  appearance in the District 3 championships, which begin today at Cal Lutheran.    Pilkington, an All-American last season, will open the first game of the  two-team, best-of-three series against Cal Baptist (23-22, 9-8) at 11 a.m.  Stevens, who has won her past nine decisions, will pitch the second game, which  will start 30 minutes after the completion of the first. Pilkington will return  for a third game, if necessary, at 11 a.m. Saturday.    Stevens was named District 3 Player of the Week after going nine for 25 in six  games last week. She is batting .328 this season. Pilkington, earlier named  District Pitcher of the Week, and Stevens are the only two Cal Lutheran players  to receive either district honor this season.    The District 3 champion will travel to play the winner of District 7, probably  either Western New Mexico State or Mesa State (Colo.), in a best-of-three  bi-district tournament, May 10-11. The winner moves on to the 16-team  nationals, May 17-19 at the University of West Florida in Pensacola.    Cal Lutheran's past two trips to the nationals, a double-elimination  tournament, ended quickly with consecutive losses both years, but first-year  coach Venditto believes that past is not necessarily prologue for his  14th-ranked Regals.    "We have really what I call a three-step goal to win districts, to win  bi-districts and go to nationals," said Venditto. "I honestly believe we can  finish in the top four of nationals."    Cal Lutheran has won all four meetings with Cal Baptist.    Kim White leads the team in 10 offensive categories, including batting average  (.391). After playing center field and second base, White has moved to third  base to replace Tina Bumgarner, the team leader in runs batted in (25) who  suffered a season-ending knee injury.

headline:   ROUNDUP;    HIGHLAND HALL CLINCHES 4TH TITLE IN A ROW   
text:   Highland Hall High routed host South Bay Lutheran, 28-3, Thursday to clinch its  fourth consecutive Westside League title with its 31st league victory in a row.    Jakob Jensen (8-0) pitched three innings to earn the win and hit a grand slam  and drove in seven runs.    Five players had three hits for Highland Hall (20-2, 7-0 in league play).    In other baseball games:    Sylmar 8, Grant 3 -- London Woodfin knocked out three hits and drove in two  runs to lead host Sylmar to an East Valley League win in a makeup of a rainout.    Gonzalo Hernandez (5-3) pitched 3 1/3 innings of middle relief to pick up the  win for second-place Sylmar (16-7, 10-5). James Encinas added two hits and two  runs batted in for the winners.    Tony Kuper (3-7) took the loss for Grant (5-17, 3-12).    Queen of Angels 5, Oakwood 4 -- Tony Garcia's two-out, two-run double in the  seventh inning erased a 4-3 deficit and gave Queen of Angels (11-4, 11-0) the  Liberty League championship. Felix Renteria had two hits, including a triple,  to lead Queen of Angels.    Darin Margules, Gentry Dick and Matt Williams each had two hits for Oakwood  (11-3, 8-2).    SOFTBALL    Hart 1, San Gabriel 0 (eight innings) -- Kym Weil (21-1) notched her 82nd  career win, breaking the Southern Section record held by De De Weinman of Gahr  in leading Hart (22-2, 8-0) to an extra-inning Foothill League win at San  Gabriel.    Heather Medearis hit a home run down the right-field line to open the eighth  inning in support of Weil, who struck out 10 and walked none in scattering five  hits.    Simi Valley 1, Camarillo 0 -- Heather Santiago allowed only one hit and Taina  Tande scored on a sixth-inning error as Simi Valley (18-8, 8-3) secured second  place in the Marmonte League.    Santiago struck out 12 and lost her no-hit bid when Kim Mangan singled in the  fifth.    Faith Baptist 11, Brentwood 0 -- April Will hit two home runs and drove in  three runs to lead host Faith Baptist (5-9, 5-2) to a Delphic League win.    Alemany 3, Chaminade 1 -- Brenda Garcia and winning pitcher Melanie Howard  (10-3) stroked RBI doubles in a three-run third inning for Alemany (16-5, 6-2)  in a San Fernando Valley League game at Chaminade.    Saugus 1, Palmdale 0 -- Saugus (14-10, 6-2) broke a first-place tie in the  Golden League with Palmdale (18-6, 5-3) on the strength of a one-hitter by  sophomore Kerry Coudry.    Newbury Park 7, Westlake 1 -- Melody Bolger had three hits and Marcie James  drove in two runs to support the two-hit pitching of Lea Lopez (16-5) for host  Newbury Park (20-6, 11-1) in a Marmonte League game.    Hoover 8, Pasadena 0 -- Nancy Evans (15-4) struck out 16, walked none and  scattered two hits for Hoover (16-4, 5-3) in a Pacific League game at Pasadena.    La Reina 14, Carpinteria 0 -- Valerie Serpico was three for three, including a  three-run triple, and Michelle St. Pierre (9-3) tossed a two-hitter to lead La  Reina (18-5, 10-0), which clinched the Tri-Valley League title.    San Fernando 12, Kennedy 3 -- Gloria Sanchez and Gina Mena each had two hits  and a triple for San Fernando (13-6, 6-4) in a North Valley League game at  Kennedy.    Cleveland 14, Granada Hills 6 -- Amy Horst had two hits, including a home run,  to spark Cleveland in a North Valley League game at Granada Hills.    Poly 10, North Hollywood 6 -- Tina Thomas' bases-loaded triple and Jodi Soto's  three-run home run keyed a six-run second inning for Poly (12-5, 5-1), which  clinched its third consecutive East Valley League title.    El Camino Real 6, Taft 0 -- Chrissy Peck tossed a one-hitter and struck out  nine to round out an unbeaten Northwest Valley Conference season for host El  Camino Real (18-2, 10-0).

headline:   NOTEBOOK;    GORDON, LIEBERTHAL TO SQUARE OFF IN BID TO SETTLE POWER STRUGGLE   
text:   Joe Gordon of Simi Valley High and Westlake's Mike Lieberthal will go head to  head today in their quests for the Southern Section single-season home run  record when Westlake visits Simi Valley in a Marmonte League game.    Gordon hit his 14th homer Wednesday, leaving him two shy of the record set by  Arnold Garcia of Channel Islands in 1981. Lieberthal has been stuck at 13 since  April 20.    Garcia was a left-handed pull hitter whose home runs over the right-field fence  at Channel Islands would be met by a chorus of moos.    "There was an animal-husbandry class on the other side of the fence," recalled  Don Cardinal, the Channel Islands coach. "We'd say he was taking them deep into  the cows."    Because Channel Islands is also in the Marmonte League, Cardinal has watched  firsthand the assault on Garcia's record.    "Arnold was a lot like Gordon and Lieberthal," he said. "Not a big kid, but he  just had that stroke, and he worked real hard at his hitting."    Although Gordon has hit more home runs recently, Lieberthal figures to have  more games ahead of him.    Simi Valley (11-11, 4-6 in league play) finishes its league schedule Wednesday  and is a long shot to make the playoffs. Westlake (23-1, 11-0) closes out  league play today but is certain to be the top-seeded team in the 5-A Division  playoffs.    Pitching rich: Few expected Saugus High to have strong pitching this season.    Gone was Roger Salkeld, picked third in last June's amateur draft by the  Seattle Mariners.    Left behind were sophomores Chris Hernandez and David Weeg, and junior Doug  Maggiora, who logged all of six innings last season.    But a combined effort has carried the Centurions far. With a respectable team  earned-run average of 3.49, Saugus (15-5-1 overall) is atop the Golden League  standings with a 10-1 record and holds a three-game lead over second-place  Palmdale.    The side-arming Maggiora, who routinely has entered games in the middle  innings, has been most impressive. He has compiled an 8-1 record with four  saves and a 2.59 ERA in 67 1/3 innings -- most in the Valley area.    Hernandez (5-2, 4.20), a left-hander, and Weeg (2-0, 3.29), a right-hander,  have held their own at the varsity level and show a lot of promise.    In the spotlight: New names have cropped up in the box scores of Poly's games.  A look at the batteries in recent Parrot outings reveals names such as Torres  and Rocha notching wins and saves for Poly (20-3, 15-0) -- names unseen two  weeks ago.    But the fresh faces are producing. Raul Torres and Adolpho Rocha, both juniors,  have been thrust into the limelight since mainstays David Giatti (broken ankle)  and Rodrigo Dorame (tender arm) became unable to pitch.    Torres, especially, has been effective, notching a 4-1 record in six  appearances. He is now Coach Jerry Cord's No. 2 starter behind senior Eddie  Castellanos (11-0).    "They're still just getting their feet wet, really," Cord said of the tandem.  "I didn't figure they'd throw much, except in relief. But they're just tough  kids. They want to compete."    If it isn't broken: Birmingham has won 12 consecutive games. Birmingham is a  baseball team. Ergo, Birmingham is superstitious.    Following the grand baseball tradition of quirky, off-beat behavior that  characterizes a team on a win streak, the Braves have decided to shun their  white, home jerseys in favor of the blue road jerseys they wore during the  Holt-Goodman tournament that launched the win streak. Even at home, the Braves  wear road blue.    "It came time for us to wear our home jerseys again," Coach Wayne Sink said,  "and the guys said to me, 'White jerseys? What white jerseys?' "    Staff writers Steve Henson, Vince Kowalick and Brian Murphy contributed to this  notebook.

text:   The women's tennis teams from San Diego State and the University of San Diego  earned berths Thursday in the NCAA Division I tournament beginning Wednesday at  the University of Florida.    The No. 12-ranked Aztecs (17-11) were seeded 14th and will play 17th-seeded  Indiana Wednesday. No. 14-ranked USD (11-11) was seeded 16th and will play  19th-seeded Kentucky.    La Jolla's Liz Harper is the only San Diegan to advance to today's  quarterfinals of the National Hardcourt championships at the La Jolla Beach and  Tennis Club. Harper, seeded sixth and playing in the women's 60s, defeated Fay  Shwayder of Lakewood, Colo., 6-0, 6-1 to advance.    MEN'S TENNIS    In the Western Athletic Conference team championships in Fort Collins, Colo.,  the top-seeded SDSU men's team was upset by Utah, 5-1. It is the ninth time in  11 years defending champion Utah has won the WAC team title.    After winning the singles competition, 5-1, the teams did not play doubles.  Freshman Kerry Safdie was the only winner for the Aztecs, defeating Chris  Reilley 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5). SDSU (21-9) finished second and Mew Mexico and Air  Force tied for third.    MEN'S GOLF    San Diego State golfers Kevin Riley and Doug Karney recorded scores of 69 and  were tied with two other golfers for second place after the opening round of  the Western Athletic Conference tournament, Thursday.    Riley and Karney trailed Brigham Young's Ed Fryatt and Mike Weir, who both shot  tournament-record 65s in the first of four rounds in El Paso, Texas. BYU, at  10-under-par 270, led the team standings. SDSU was fourth at 10-over 290.    Second-seeded Kim Wright was one of three Point Loma Nazarene singles players  who advanced to the round of eight in the NAIA District 3 Women's Tennis  Championships Thursday.

Tops on Ward's list, of course, is his remarkable record in the Indianapolis  500. He won it twice and from 1959 through 1964 finished first, second, third,  first, fourth and second.    During that period, Ward won two USAC season championships, was runner-up three  times and placed third once. All told, he won 26 championship races between  1951 and his retirement in 1966.    Ward will always look back fondly to the place where it all began -- the old  quarter-mile dirt track at Balboa Stadium.    Now 69, Ward reminisced while speaking at the Hall of Champions recently. He is  in town from his home in Alta Loma for the second Rodger Ward Invitational  Historic Grand Prix, which will be held Saturday and Sunday on a 1.7-mile road  course in the west parking lot at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.    "Balboa is where I really blossomed as a race driver," Ward said. "It's one of  my all-time favorite tracks."    Ward was born in Beloit, Kan., but grew up in South Pasadena, where he built a  hot rod from used parts in his father's wrecking yard at the age of 13. He was  fresh from a four-year hitch as an Air Force pilot in World War II when he made  his debut as a midget-car driver at Balboa in 1946. He scored his first victory  a year later in the San Diego Grand Prix.    "The first race I ever drove, I wound up upside down," he said. "I was running  last and, when I made my move, I spun out. Then Johnny Mantz's car hit my car,  and they took me to the hospital to see if my brains were scrambled.    "In '47, I had a car that ran pretty well but I wasn't making it into the main  event. Toward the end of '47, I got into a car owned by Willie West and, for  the first time, I was the fastest qualifier. I won a trophy dash or two, and I  was always in the main event.    "Then came the San Diego Grand Prix. I qualified second, so I was on the  outside of the front row. I took the lead on the first turn and was never  headed. Those few weeks in that car were the beginning of my success."    From then through 1950, Ward won "about six or seven races a year" at Balboa  Stadium.    "I'm not sure how many I won altogether, but it was around 25," Ward said.  "That was all in midgets."    Ward also had some trying times at Balboa Stadium.    "In '49, I was driving for Perry Grim and there was one evening I'll never  forget," Ward said. "Perry said to me, 'Rodger, I know you like to run high,  but there's one hole on the track, so make sure you miss it.'    "Well, I went out to qualify and, the first time around, I hit the hole and  flipped upside down. The car was bent all to hell, and Perry was fit to be  tied.    "Later that year, Jimmy Bryan, who went on to be a tough Indy driver (winning  the 500 in 1958), tried to do a slide job on me. He didn't get by, and he  knocked me upside down.    "It was one of the worst accidents I ever had. I broke my right arm and left  wrist, and the ball of my right shoulder was cut into five pieces. I was out  until late in the season."    Ward's most serious crackup occurred at the Riverside Speedway in 1962.    "I broke my back in three places that time," he said. "My brakes failed and I  went off an embankment. My only thought was to keep the car right-side up. If I  had flipped over, it would have wiped me out. I went through a chain-link fence  that I thought was going to break my head off, but I stayed up."    There is one accident that still brings sadness to Ward. He was a key figure in  the wreck that took the life of Bill Vukovich in the 1955 Indy 500.    "Billy and I were close friends," Ward said. "We traveled together, and I  really admired him. He had won Indy in '53 and '54 and would have won in '52 if  his steering hadn't failed with nine laps to go.    "He was leading again after 56 laps and I was three laps behind him when my  front axle broke. I hit the wall and flipped three times and ended up on the  track. Al Keller went across the track to avoid me and hit Johnny Boyd. Then  Vukovich ran up over Boyd, flipped end over end, and lost his life.    "Because of that tragedy, I nearly retired. I was so distressed, I was ready to  hang it up then and there. But Billy's brother told me I could be great if I  concentrated on driving, so I made up my mind to become more serious about it."    Foremost in Ward's determination to dig deeper within himself was to shed his  reputation as a playboy.    "Until then, I was probably more famous for my social life," he said. "People  thought I drank too much, although actually I drank very little, but I was  never able to handle booze. I also chased a few women at that time.    "The car I drove in '55 was owned by Lyle Greenman, who had bought it from J.C.  Agajanian after Troy Ruttman won the 500 with it in '52. Before the race,  Greenman said to me, 'I don't know if you can last 500 miles, because you're up  all night.' I'll have to admit I hadn't done much to dispel that reputation.    "So after Billy Vukovich's death, I gave up smoking and drinking, and I decided  it was in my best interests to get married. In those days, if you were a single  man on the road, people considered you a bum."    Ward's change in life style -- he was married in the early 1950s, later  divorced and remarried 10 years ago -- paid off. He finished eighth in 1956,  and after being forced out the next two years by mechanical problems, he found  the combination that carried him to his first victory in 1959.    Ward had been driving for Roger Wolcott, who died after the 1958 season.  Suddenly a free agent, Ward decided to hook up with a Milwaukee car owner named  Bob Wilke. A.J. Watson was Wilke's chief mechanic, and Ward considered Watson  the best.    "Wilke gave me $1,000 to sign and $1,500 when I qualified for Indy. I was a kid  with a new toy.    "They built me a new car every year, and I was always up there. Besides the two  500s I won, I should have won two others -- in '60 and '64. Those years, things  that shouldn't have happened went wrong."    After failing to qualify in 1965 and placing 15th in 1966, Ward decided to  retire.    "Watson built me a car in '65 that was a total disaster," Ward said. "I thought  about retiring then, but I didn't want to go out on a sour note, so I kept  racing in '66. I won at Trenton, finished second at Phoenix and qualified quite  well at Indy, so I felt like I had proved to myself that I could still drive.    "I made my retirement announcement at the awards dinner after the 500, and it  was a very emotional thing. I had offers to drive again, but I couldn't have  lived with myself if I'd come back and been an also-ran."    Ward now serves as an analyst on many auto-race telecasts, and is much in  demand for speaking engagements. Although he dropped out of Franklin High  School in Highland Park after his junior year, it would be hard to find a more  articulate or entertaining speaker.    "I was always a glib talker," he said. "And wherever I go, I recall the old  days at Balboa Stadium. It was one of the places I really enjoyed racing. The  crowds were probably more enthusiastic than anywhere else."    Race Notes    Rodger Ward rode in last year's inaugural Vintage Grand Prix as a passenger in  a 1914 Tahi Special, in which it was necessary for him to pump the oil and gas.  He says he might drive this year but won't say for sure. . . . Racing starts at  1 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday, following trials from 9 a.m. to noon. There  will be seven races each day with cars in nine different classifications. One  race will consist of 14 restored pre-World War II race cars; five others will  match foreign and domestic production cars matched according to size and horse  power. Two formula races will include class A, B and C model cars, including  McLarens, Lotuses, Lolas, Coopers and Porsches. . . . All races will be run on  a nine-turn, 1.7-mile-course on the west end of the San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium parking lot. A total of 160 cars have been entered, all built before  1972. . . . An car auction will be held from noon to 6 p.m. both days near the  main gate. . . . Tickets are $12 a day, $22 for both days purchased in advance,  $15 and $25 if purchased at the gate. Parking is free.

headline:   LA JOLLA WOMAN HOPING FOR HOME-COURT EDGE   
text:   With the home-court advantage and a history of success against higher seeded  players, Liz Harper of La Jolla might well be in position to win the women's  60s singles in the U.S. National Hardcourt Championships at the La Jolla Beach  and Tennis Club.    Harper, who plays No. 1-seeded Margorie Kohler of Carmel in today's  quarterfinals, is trying to win her third tournament in as many tries this  season. She defeated Fay Schwayder, of Lakewood, Colo., 6-0, 6-1, in the third  round Thursday.    After receiving a first-round bye, Harper, the sixth seed, defeated Muriel Bard  of Laguna Hills, 6-0, 6-2, in Wednesday's second round.    "I've played all the top seeds before and on occasion beaten them," Harper  said. "To win a national tournament, it takes a combination of playing well and  some luck, too."    Just last week, Harper defeated Kohler of Carmel at the Northern California  Sectionals in Carmel.    "I think she was a little nervous since it was her home court," Harper said.  "I'm sure she wants to meet me again."    In February, Harper won the Southern California Tournament at Palm Springs, her  first appearance this year.    Harper shies away from playing both singles and doubles in national tournaments  because the competition is tougher and the matches are usually longer.    "The competition is so tough when I get to the later rounds," Harper said. "I  just have too much tennis to play. I like singles better so I usually just play  singles."    Harper grew up in Santa Maria, which at that time had a population of 10,000  and no tennis programs.    While attending UC Berkeley she met her future husband Oscar Harper, who was a  member of the men's tennis team. Once they began dating, she figured she better  learn how to play. She took lessons but didn't compete in her first tournament  until she was 40 and living in Altadena.    She taught at Mayfield Senior School, a private girls' school, and served as  the tennis coach, health education teacher and athletic director.    "Since tennis was a part of my work, I was giving more hours to work on my  game," Harper said. "In trying to help and analyze other people, my stamina  improved. I hit that many more tennis balls."    Now, because both Liz and Oscar have retired, they are able to practice  together and they occasionally play in tournaments with senior mixed doubles.  This one doesn't.    "It's much better on the mixed doubles court if we don't talk," Harper said.  "Some couples argue while they're playing, but we get along on the court. Oscar  calls it mixed troubles, but always with a smile."    The Harpers will have an unusual experience this summer when they travel to  Europe for the first time to play in two tournaments, one in Vichy, France, and  the other in Monaco. They will play singles and mixed doubles.    Not only must they adapt to playing on clay instead of hardcourt, the language  barrier could present a problem when it comes to scoring. Consequently, Harper  carries a French pocket dictionary in order to practice scoring and key  phrases. Harper has played on both clay and grass but prefers hardcourt or  indoor surfaces.    "I'll probably lose my concentration on my game," she said, laughing, "because  I'll be trying to figure out how to say the score."

headline:   USIU KEEPS TALKING UP AN AMERICAN CONFERENCE   
text:   Come the 1991-92 basketball season, U.S. International may take its  high-scoring act and soar happily above what it hopes will be the newest NCAA  affiliate: the American Conference.    Thursday in Mission Valley, athletic directors from six independent  universities gathered to further discuss plans for a new conference that Al  Palmiotto, USIU Athletic Director, has been working on for two years.    After a day of discussion, representatives from USIU, Southern Utah State, Cal  State Northridge, Missouri-Kansas City, Northeastern Illinois and Chicago State  agreed to take recommendations for a new basketball conference back to their  respective presidents for approval by June 7.    In addition to the six schools attending -- the NCAA requirement to form a  conference -- Sacramento State, Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Youngstown and Wright  State expressed interest but failed to send a representative.    "We agreed that a basketball conference would be in our best interest," said  Palmiotto, "and right now, it would be a beginning for all of us. We decided  we're all going back to our schools to get approval or denial."    Palmiotto and the other athletic directors decided that forming a  basketball-only conference would be beneficial because basketball is the only  sport where they consistently have scheduling difficulties.    "The trouble with being an independent," said Palmiotto, "is that we never know  until that year if people will hold to their contract with us. There's more of  a moral commitment in a conference. People in our conference won't walk out."    Bob Heigert, Cal State Northridge athletic director, said scheduling basketball  games for November and December is easy, but January and February is another  story.    "We have five established conferences on the West Coast," Heigert said. "That  puts us in a bind when we have to schedule games. It leaves us with some  tremendous voids. We're off the last three weeks in December to late January  and we can never find teams to play us."    Palmiotto said schools will be required to make a two-year commitment to the  conference.

headline:   MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: EXPORTS FUELING THE ECONOMY, MAY SPARK STOCK RALLY   
text:   An old story on Wall Street may soon get new attention -- and for good reason.  It may justify the stock market's next surge.    The story is that overseas demand for U.S. goods and services continues to  mushroom. Export business is so good, in fact, that it helped make up for soft  domestic demand in the first quarter for many companies. That kept the slide in  first-quarter corporate profits from being a lot worse than it might have been.    "Export certainly has been one of the reasons why the manufacturing economy  hasn't sunk any lower," said Robert Bretz, who heads the business survey  committee of the National Assn. of Purchasing Management.    His group, which tracks the economy by watching supply and demand trends at  major companies, said its export index in April was the highest since  September.    The continuing export boom may be under-appreciated by a jaded Wall Street.  Consider that domestic demand for manufactured goods has been sluggish for  about a year as car, housing and appliance sales have weakened. That has been a  general drag on the economy.    Meanwhile, exports of heavy equipment and high-tech products to Europe and Asia  keep growing, reaching levels that many U.S. companies could only have dreamed  about in the early 1980s.    Add it up, and the export strength is a partial answer to the mystery of the  economy's resilience in the face of weak domestic demand.    "This is just what the doctor ordered," notes David Hale, economist at Kemper  Financial Services in Chicago. Remember when, just a few years back, economists  warned that flat exports and rising imports threatened to cut the legs out from  under the U.S. economy?    In 1987, this country imported $113 billion more than it exported, counting all  goods and services. By last year, the deficit was cut to $47 billion.    So the progress is real. And even better, it's almost certain to continue, even  as the dollar remains surprisingly strong -- normally a negative for exporters.  The simple fact is that the world needs a lot of new nuts-and-bolts-type  equipment.    "One of the bullish things about the next two to three years is the capital  goods cycle," Hale said. Overseas and at home, many companies are spending huge  amounts of money to modernize their plants or build new ones. Governments,  meanwhile, are committed to rebuilding sewer and road systems and to forcing  new pollution-control systems on factories. And Eastern Europe will require a  major overhaul if it's to be brought into the world trading system.    The machinery needed for those projects -- the air compressors, generators,  tractors, computers and other goods -- are the forte of U.S. manufacturers.  Even if West Germany wanted to keep the entire European market to itself, it  couldn't, notes Lacy Hunt, economist at CM&amp;M Group in New York. "West  German plants already are working at capacity," he said. And Japan, too, is  investing heavily in its own economy, limiting its export capacity.    Hunt believes that another surge in U.S. exports, combined with new vigor in  the service economy, will push real U.S. economic growth to an annualized rate  of 3% in the current quarter, from 2.1% in the first quarter.    Translation for the stock market: Corporate profits may come in much stronger  than expected. And even if interest rates continue to inch higher -- the price  we pay for an expanding economy -- the end of recession worries may give  investors new reasons to look at stocks.    Although investors are conditioned to believe that stocks can't rise if  interest rates are rising, it isn't true. Everything depends on the economic  background. Stocks soared in 1983 as the economy rebounded, even though rates  were rising as well.    In recent days, stocks such as Deere, Caterpillar, Ingersoll-Rand, Fluor Corp.  and Compaq Computer have seen renewed buying. All are major exporters of goods  or services. The market may be telling us that, despite the short-term gloom  over interest rates, the long-term economic picture looks better, not worse.    Europe's Not So Bad, Either: Everybody knows Europe will be an exciting  investment arena in the 1990s. But the expected economic changes there will  undoubtedly produce a lot of losers as well. This is a time for particularly  careful stock picking, not rushing wholesale into European markets, says  Penelope Dobkin, manager of Fidelity Group's Europe Fund.    Dobkin has run the Europe Fund since 1986. She has $370 million under  management, spread among 90 stocks. Her track record: Up 25.93% in the 12  months ended March 31, compared to 22.37% for the average Europe-focused fund.  In the first quarter, Dobkin's fund gained 1.61%, compared to 0.82% for the  average Europe fund. (The average U.S. stock fund lost 2.31%.)    Dobkin says the euphoria over West Germany's future isn't a lot of hype. But  forget the talk about an avalanche of profits falling on West German companies  from Eastern European business ventures. "That's not going to come before  1995," she said, especially given the costs of absorbing East Germany into the  West.    The reason to buy West German stocks now is that they're severely undervalued  just based on their underlying assets, including land, Dobkin said. U.S. stocks  went through an asset-value phase in the late '80s. In West Germany, only now  are the usually secretive companies beginning to disclose what their assets are  worth.    The asset value of West German companies is estimated at about 1 trillion West  German marks, Dobkin said. The value of their stocks on the open market,  meanwhile, is about half that. Pretty simple math, Dobkin figures. And those  asset values are destined to rise, she said, because West German economic  growth will be Europe's locomotive over the next few years.    She has 19% of her fund's assets invested in West German stocks, the heaviest  weighting in any European nation. And she's sticking with the blue chips --  industrial giants such as Siemens and Veba, and big banks such as Deutsche  Bank.    "The average European portfolio is overweighted with smaller stocks," Dobkin  said. But she thinks that, while the smaller issues were the success stories of  the 1980s, the big names will be the hot stocks of the 1990s. One good reason:  "Just look at what the Japanese are buying," she said. Japanese investors are  taken with Europe, and just as they played the blue chip names in the United  States in the late '80s, they're looking for the same kind of stocks in West  Germany.    After Germany, the heaviest stock weightings in Dobkin's portfolio are France  (13% of assets), Britain (13%), the Netherlands (13%), Switzerland (6%), Spain  (5%) and Norway (4%).    She is most worried about Britain. She recently slashed her holdings there (the  weighting was 24% on Jan. 1). Dobkin sees great risk of high inflation in  Britain leading to a recession later this year. And the market doesn't reflect  the major possibility of a liberal Labor government coming to power by 1992,  she said.      THE EXPORT BOOM    While the U.S. economy slowed last year, overseas demand for U.S. goods soared  -- a trend that has continued into 1990, helping support corporate earnings.

headline:   FINANCIAL MARKETS;    COMMODITIES;    OIL PRICES SLUMP DESPITE OPEC PACT   
text:   Prices of oil futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange despite  an OPEC agreement to cut the cartel's total crude oil output by 1.45 million  barrels a day.    Analysts said the decline in prices signaled the return of traders who had  taken to the sidelines during the emergency meeting of the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva and who see little hope in the near  term for an easing of the crude oil glut.    On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower;  copper futures fell; precious metals advanced, and livestock and meat futures  were mixed.    West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 37 to 74 cents lower in New  York, with the contract for delivery in June at $17.99 a barrel.

headline:   FINANCIAL MARKETS;    CURRENCY;    DOLLAR MIXED IN JITTERY TRADING   
text:   The dollar fell against the West German mark but gained on the Japanese yen in  nervous trading before today's release of U.S. employment data and this  weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized countries in Washington.    Talk of heavy institutional buying of dollars for yen pulled the U.S. currency  higher, traders said.    The dollar buying occurred despite a senior U.S. official's comment that the  United States is still concerned about the yen, which has dropped sharply this  year.    The dollar ended at 1.6830 West German marks, down from 1.6850 on Wednesday and  at 158.10 Japanese yen, up from 157.95.    Dealers said uncertainty about the inflationary impact of German unification  made trading in West German marks choppy and unfocused.    The British pound fell to $1.6390 from $1.6430 at Wednesday's close. Against  its Canadian counterpart, the dollar fell to $1.1660 Canadian, compared to  $1.1675 Canadian on Wednesday.    The dollar bought 1.4550 Swiss francs, against 1.4545 on Wednesday, and 5.6465  French francs, compared to 5.6535 francs.

headline:   BOOK REVIEW;    SOME EXTRAORDINARY FAMILY SNAPSHOTS;    FAMILY PICTURES BY SUE MILLER HARPER &amp; ROW $19.95, 330 PAGES   
text:   "Family Pictures" is literature by exorcism. When the writer is in complete  control of the material, as Sue Miller is here, the reader also will be  possessed, oblivious to claims outside the hermetic world of the book until the  last page is turned.    If a writer can accomplish this transference with virtually no plot and the  most skeletal structure, with a cast of only eight principal characters and a  setting no more exotic than an upper-middle-class Chicago neighborhood, you  know you're in splendid company.    The effect an autistic boy has on his parents and siblings is Miller's subject:  a tough, uncompromising theme that must be deeply felt and thoroughly absorbed.  Miller keeps the medical details to a minimum. You know that Randall Eberhardt  is a physically attractive child; that his usual silent passivity is broken  only rarely by uncontrollable destructive outbursts, mostly against things but  occasionally -- and terrifyingly -- against the persons who love him.    This is not a book about the pathology of autism, but about the way Randall's  condition forms, alters and skews his parents' marriage and the directions  taken by his brothers and sisters. There are two older children -- Lyddie and  Macklin -- and three younger girls, born to prove that Randall was a cosmic  accident for which no one is responsible.    Although the story is told from several points of view, the dominant voice is  Nina's -- first of "the last straws," the biggest "little pitcher of health."  Those are their father's pet names for his small daughters, and the irony is  apparent even to the tots.    Nina is strategically placed to be the spokesperson; after Randall, before her  small sisters. She's the living demonstration that all can be well again, and  from earliest childhood, that obligation motivates and burdens her. Randall  remains remote, a powerful catalyst working almost invisibly upon the others,  virtually inert until the precarious equilibrium is disturbed.    As the Eberhardt story unfolds over the 4 1/2 decades beginning with David and  Lainey's marriage in 1940, we realize Randall is the binding force that holds  the family together. When the wrenching decision is finally reached to place  him in a more structured environment, the tightly woven family fabric unravels.  Once he's gone, the older two children suddenly find themselves directionless,  with no substitute for the constraints Randall provided. The glue that had  turned the three younger girls into a self-sufficient unit dissolves, and they  drift apart.    One day, in a burst of directionless rage, Randall pushes his mother down the  stairs. By then, David and Lainey have separated. Sarah, the youngest, phones  her father, who responds immediately, cleaning Lainey's deep head wound,  calming Randall and getting him to bed, staying the night.    Indirectly, we've learned enough about autism to realize that such outbursts  are more frequent after puberty, triggered by the same hormones that turn  docile children into sullen rebels. As David said so long ago, there was no  other Randall inside this one, struggling to emerge; no love great enough to  create a person inside the shell.    And so Randall goes away, to the best of the available places. Macklin goes,  too -- to Vietnam, after drifting through a semester at Harvard. Unmoored, with  no further reason to be exceptional, Mack longs for the humdrum. He returns  safely from the war and buys a bar.    Beautiful, gifted Lyddie settles for a series of stopgap jobs. Nina, our  narrator, escapes into a marriage so suffocatingly bland that she must leave  her husband to find the more demanding life for which her childhood prepared  her.    The saga emerges from vignettes -- snaps of Lainey and David young and happy  with their babies and friends; overheard recriminations leading to their  separation; glimpses of the children at school, at play and in love; apparently  unposed, candid pictures cataloguing the manners and mores of the last 40  years, revealing character more honestly than any formal portraits could.  That's all, but Miller has made "Family Pictures" as compelling as life itself.    Next: Carolyn See reviews "Hype and Glory" by William Goldman.

headline:   TROUBLES AT THE JOFFREY;    DANCE REVIEW;    A GLITZY PREMIERE MASKS WOES   
text:   On the surface, it looked like another op'nin', another show for the Joffrey  Ballet.    Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the typical triple bill began  with some old neo-classical kitsch and ended with a spangly new ode to the  faded glories of vaudeville. Both instant crowd-pleasers were choreographed by  the official keeper of the Joffrey flame, Gerald Arpino.    In between came a knowing nod in the direction of dainty romanticism.  Eclecticism remains a Joffrey speciality.    The dancing, throughout, reflected the customary high spirits complemented by  reasonably high finesse. Although the faces in the company change, the gutsy  attitudes do not.    Still, it couldn't have been business as usual on this occasion. Few in the  dressy, unruly, non-capacity audience for this non-gala gala may have known it,  but the show went on while the company confronted chronic, possibly fatal,  turmoil behind the scenes.    Financial crises clouded the horizon. The trustees and administrators were  engaged in savage internal warfare. Loyalties were polarized.    Resignations and defections had begun to pile up. Accusations and  counter-accusations echoed from coast to coast. Arpino's continuing role as  artistic director languished in doubt. So, for that matter, did the immediate  survival of the Arpino-Joffrey oeuvre as we have long known and sometimes loved  it.    Ironically, the inaugural festivities at the Music Center accentuated the  negative in matters of repertory. Arpino's "Italian Suite," first seen in 1983,  is little more than a collection of amiable cliches. The frantic cheer is  filtered through cloying rosy lights, and propelled by speedy steps and  athletic contortions that contradict the impulses of Wolf-Ferrari gurgling in  the pit.    Nothing offensive can happen here. Nothing memorable can happen, either. It is  all too pat, too predictable, too eager to attract at the most obvious level.    At least "Italian Suite" isn't pretentious. That cannot be said of "The  Pantages and the Palace Present 'TWO-A-DAY.' "    Arpino's latest show-biz extravaganza is a splashy, glitzy, costly, witless  production number. Also a massive bore.    It looks nice, in its defiantly tasteless and nostalgic way. It lacks focus,  however. It lacks purpose. It lacks balletic interest. It lacks point, not to  mention a point of view.    It pretends to revere the traditions of the all-American variety show, as  sandwiched between sagas of the Silver Screen. The idea isn't original, but  there may be some life in it yet.    Not here.    Arpino can't seem to decide if he wants to glorify the past or to satirize it.  He doesn't seem sure if he wants his eager cast to dance or just to mug. He  ends up falling between most of the stylistic chairs for 40 ponderous minutes.    The first damaging clues come from the pit. The choreographer -- who is also  credited with the "conception" -- could have exhumed some great period ditties.  On the other hand, he could have commissioned a new score predicated on  illuminating parody. Instead, he engaged Elliot Kaplan to rework some limp  platitudes written by none other than Rebekah Harkness, a patron of the arts  who was blessed with more money than talent. Some of her money, not  incidentally, underwrote this dubious venture.    The proceedings begin irrelevantly with the final teary snippets of "A Star Is  Born," the 1937 version featuring Janet Gaynor. The printed program then  promises "The Voice" of "The Incomparable Mr. Tony Randall." It eluded these  ears.    The parade of impersonations begins as Jodie Gates invokes Sally Rand's fans  but not her bare skin. Elizabeth Parker and six attending swells do an ersatz  tap routine. Time dips back to Mack Sennett for a fatuous bathing-beauty number  in which Peter Narbutas flexes his biceps while flirting with a bump and grind.    Julie Janus and Tom Mossbrucker indulge in a would-be exotic harem duet in  which the hero suggests more of Valentino than Nijinsky. Beatriz Rodriguez,  eternally typecast as the sizzling Latina, leads a sort-of-Spanish  divertissement. Carole Valleskey undulates filmy butterfly wings in the manner  of Loie Fuller. Tina LeBlanc, petite and eternally innocent, descends from the  flies on a wired crescent moon in a fruitless fabrication of the sexy Marilyn  Miller mystique.    Finally, and not a moment too soon, everyone comes back for a valedictory  Charleston climax. It was choreographed not by Arpino but by Louis Johnson.    The participants give their all for their boss in the various thankless  charades. There is a lot of talent here, most of it smothered in gook. For  better and worse, Gerald Arpino may just be the Andrew Lloyd Webber of dance.    For at least one ungrateful viewer, the greatest satisfactions of the evening  involved the ancient lightweight charms of Arthur Saint-Leon's "La Vivandiere."  In the pas de six, the exquisite Tina LeBlanc and the mercurial Edward Stierle  were fleetly seconded by Cameron Baden, Jodie Gates, Cynthia Giannini and Kim  Sagani.    Here one could savor ballet without padding, without puffery, without false  sentiment and without gimmickry. It was reassuring.

headline:   MOVIE REVIEW;    'HAPPY' ECHOES '30S COMEDY   
text:   "Happy Together" (selected theaters) has the smarts to take a clever idea and  run with it. Serious-minded would-be playwright Chris (Patrick Dempsey) and  blithe-spirited aspiring actress Alex (Helen Slater), because of her unisex  name, wind up as freshman roommates in a university dorm. The result is "The  Odd Couple" turned into a brisk and bubbly romantic comedy.    Writer Craig J. Nevius has written wonderful roles for Dempsey and Slater, two  of the most attractive, talented young actors on the screen today, and they in  turn come through with some of their best work yet under Mel Damski's shrewd,  deft direction. "Happy Together" is a pleasure in the tradition of '30s  screwball comedy -- a genre many attempt but few succeed with -- in which  fantastic situations evoke genuine emotion.    Slater is a delight as she takes on the time-honored task of making a certified  pain-in-the-neck irresistible. Having settled in before Chris arrives, the  mercurial Alex has transformed their room into cluttered pastel paradise with a  plastic water tub in the center of the room. Her extroverted personality and  whimsical ways drive Chris nuts, yet in the three weeks it takes him to arrange  a room transfer he's ready to cancel it.    Therein lies the persuasive charm of the film. Within that period Chris begins  to understand that he's a stick figure -- that, as his drama professor (Marius  Weyers) points out, he can't write unless he's lived -- and that Slater's  flamboyance masks the vulnerability of an unloved child, the product of a  broken marriage. (According to Alex, her rich father ranks his Mercedes before  her.) At the same time, it starts to dawn upon Alex that she might do well to  take both her studies and Alex more seriously.    Weyers, who starred in "The Gods Must Be Crazy," gives the film dimension, as  does Barbara Babcock, entirely believable as Chris and Alex's rigorous acting  teacher, who attempts to break through Alex's superficiality as an actress. Dan  Schneider shines as Chris's bright, eccentric pal, and Kevin Hardesty is  amusing as Alex's rocker fiance. "Happy Together" (rated PG-13) is modest,  unpretentious -- and surprisingly touching underneath the giddiness.

headline:   MOVIE REVIEW;    'HIRE' A SUBTLE, SPLENDID STORY OF SEDUCTION   
text:   With his round black hat, pale face and black coat, Monsieur Hire, from the  splendid movie of the same name, might have stepped straight out of a painting  by Magritte; you half expect to be able to see blue sky and clouds straight  through him.    Instead, this small, mysterious bachelor is at the heart of a luminous and  hypnotic new film (at the Music Hall) made from one of the novels by the  always-reliable Georges Simenon. Michel Blanc plays Hire and Sandrine Bonnaire  plays his prey, the sensual young woman he watches every night from his window  opposite hers in their old Paris apartment building.    Bonnaire and Blanc are an extraordinary pairing: the warm, carelessly seductive  Alice and the reclusive, almost universally disliked Monsieur Hire, who spends  most of his nights in the dark, listening to Brahms and staring at the yellow  rectangle of light that is her apartment. What makes it creepy is that after  the startling night when Alice catches Monsieur Hire at his compulsion, she  doesn't report him to the police. Instead, she uses her power over him to draw  him into her life until they are both held by a delicately manipulated bond of  eroticism.    It's frightening for us, since we know that the milky-skinned, deeply emotional  Hire is a suspect in the murder of the 22-year-old girl from the apartment next  to his. An almost fatherly inspector (the craggy-faced Andre Wilms) is on the  case, dropping in at odd moments to hound Hire, while at the same time director  Patrice Leconte drops visual hints -- a white mark on Hire's black suit -- that  recall "M" and Peter Lorre's psychopathic killer.    The film's last major character is the thuggish Emile (Luc Thuillier), plainly  less in love with Alice than she is with him. And that is enough about the  story, which is a skein of subtleties played with the utmost deliberation and  intelligence. (The film is rated PG-13, since its eroticism is almost entirely  suggested, not shown.)    The actors are fascinating. Blanc's work has so many different levels and  layers as he builds first sympathy for Hire, then fear about his motives, that  it needs to be seen more than once to appreciate the depth involved.    Alice is one of Bonnaire's rare sunny characters, a country girl from Provence  with predictably lousy judgment about big-city men, but one who's comfortable  with her sexuality and blessedly unneurotic. Bonnaire has now shed every ounce  of the puppy fat she had in "A Nos Amours" and in "Vagabond"; with the contours  of her face defined this way, she's become even more interesting to watch and  she's always been a compelling actress.    "Monsieur Hire" is marvelously all-of-a-piece. Denis Lenoir's lighting camera  work sets a mood that's cool and detached; as a result, in retrospect this  seems to be a film played out in bluish moonlight. The atmosphere is further  deepened by the faintly ominous musical score of British avant-gardist Michael  Nyman, known also for his music for the films of Peter Greenaway.    Director Leconte, who was also co-adapter with Patrick Dewolf, has deliberately  made the period and even the location undefinable, an interesting idea that  connects his film subliminally to French policiers of the '30s and '40s, to the  Polanski of "The Tenant" or to early Hitchcock. Leconte also seems to like  visual puns, like the one in which Hire, eating a soft-boiled egg, is shot from  above and behind, the top of the egg and the top of his perfectly rounded  balding head making an exact match.

headline:   MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;    ENSEMBLE PLAYS WORKS BY FACULTY COMPOSERS   
text:   There are lots of university composers writing lots of music, some of it very  good. But much of the music exhibits a kind of sonic anemia, the symptoms of  which include dullness of rhythm, textural sameness and a marked avoidance of  drama.    There were at least three case studies of the malady on display Wednesday at  Cal State Northridge, the site of a faculty composers recital.    Hardly affected by the syndrome, however, was Daniel Kessner's Chamber Concerto  No. 4. There wasn't much melodic activity of interest, but a good deal of  rhythmic, timbral and above all textural variety, and Kessner's sense of  proportion proved unusually keen. Under the baton of the composer, seven  members of the CSN New Music Ensemble gave a surprisingly ragged performance.    Severely smitten with academic tediosis was William Toutant's "Small Suite for  Piano." With its ceaseless motoric rhythm and lack of melodic direction, the  work imparted no sense of purpose, Kary Kramer's attentive reading  notwithstanding.    Frank Campo's Concerto for Piano With Winds and Percussion displayed more  textural and timbral variety, but one grew tired of the same old brass barks  and tone clusters repeated again and again. Francoise Regnat brought energy and  virtuosity to the solo part, and members of the CSN Wind Ensemble, conducted by  Kessner, played serviceably.    One could find rhythmic interest in Aurelio de la Vega's "Magias e  Invenciones," a setting of five poems by Gaston Baquero -- but only in the  piano part (superbly played by Delores Stevens). The vocal part, delivered  without much poetic insight by soprano Anne Marie Ketchum, consisted of a  series of slow, disjunct and rather amorphous melodic lines. TERRY McQUILKIN

headline:   MOVABLE FEASTS: SUNSET GRILL: A NEIGHBORLY RESTAURANT IN SANTA MONICA   
text:   Certain new restaurants careen into a neighborhood as if they were crashing a  party, so at odds is their aesthetic and their price range with the milieu.  Other places surface and, right away, feel like an old friend. The Sunset  Grill, just 4 months old on the corner of Ocean Park Boulevard and 17th Street,  is a little bit of both.    It's set in a still-sleepy part of Santa Monica that looks almost the same as  it might have in 1953. But swivel around and check out what's written on the  the Sunset Grill's blackboard menu (grilled duck sausage, spicy Jamaican  chicken breast) and you know it's the end of the century.    I was placing my to-go order when a woman with a Liverpudlian accent walked in.  "D'ya have some of that rice me mum luvs so much?"    "The basmati with raisins? I'm sorry," owner Jean Lorda said. "We change dishes  every day."    The Liverpudlian asked for a taste of the tortellini salad and the ratatouille.  "Nice place ya got," she said. "But where are the school kids gonna go? This  used to be their burger-and-fries joint."    Well, the kids across the street will still find hamburgers (juicy, solid) and  fries (pale, frozen, forgettable). They'll also find low prices, a mom-and-pop  feeling (Jean's wife, Frances, is usually around) and a couple of traces of  France.    A businessman appeared. "I'd like that great sandwich I had last week."    Lorda looked up from the Caesar salad he was tossing -- a fine Caesar it is,  with a jolt of garlic and really crunchy croutons -- and squinted his eyes.  "Didn't you have the Royal Vegetarian?" (A splendid choice, I had it the next  time I came in: a tier of unusually sweet roasted peppers, streams of velvety  marinated Japanese eggplant, sun-dried tomato and toasted pine nuts; it's  served with a perky balsamic vinegared green salad for $4.95.)    Jean Lorda, who hails from Biarritz, makes a homey linguine basquaise, full of  sweet and slow-cooked tomatoes, onions and green pepper. The only thing I  didn't like about this dish -- and about Sunset Grill -- is that the sauce  leaked through its dumb plastic foam container onto the carpet of my car. (My  post-Earth Day pitch: Tell all the take-out shop owners you encounter to switch  to aluminum tins with cardboard tops; they can be used at home over and over  again.)    Hand-cut, homey vegetable soup is always on the stove here. And salads have  perky, clear-tasting vegetables -- though they tend to be on the under-seasoned  side, and a few need to go the last yard. Potato salad tasted merely of  mayonnaise and undercooked spud. Noodles with tarragon and caraway-seeded  sausage needs a more vigorous finish.    The sausage plates, all $4.25, are served with lots of wonderful smoky, cooked  red cabbage slivered confetti thin and dolled up with a sweet vinegar brew.  There are lean veal sausages, fennel-dense duck (from Jody Maroni) and even a  maple sausage served with potatoes. (Breakfast-to-go starts at 7:30 a.m.)    Grilled skinless chicken breast, marinated in olive oil, is juicy and attended  by hot ratatouille. The Jamaican chicken has a hint of coriander, cumin,  cinnamon and mango Champagne vinegar marinade; it's served with sweet grilled  pineapple and mellow, raisin-studded curried rice.    A research psychologist just told me that nutmeg has been found to be a calming  substance. Maybe that's why this namby-pamby-looking pasta primavera (little  bits of zucchini, really sweet carrots, a toss of peas in a warm bath of nutmeg  cream sauce) tastes so comforting.    The neighborhood has found out about Lorda's lovely homemade $2 creme caramel.  The first batch is often gone by lunch and the second isn't ready until supper  time. The only thing to do is to become a regular. Then, perhaps, Jean Lorda  will sock one away for you. Like I said, it's a neighborly place.     Sunset Grill, 1701 Ocean Park Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 450-7546. Open Monday  through Saturday 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Checks and cash only. Parking available.

headline:   RESTAURANT REVIEW;    BISTRO AT FANTASIA: A NICE SLICE OF CONTINENTAL   
text:   The City of Industry looks on the map like a gerrymandered electoral district  hugging the Union Pacific tracks. It sounds like a . . . well, a terribly  industrial sort of place.    There's more to it than that, though. At Azusa Avenue there's the impressive  acreage of the Puente Hills Mall. Most evenings, a line of brightly dressed  people is likely to be waiting outside a glittering nightclub called Fantasia,  right across Albatross Street from that mighty mall. Adjoining Fantasia is a  restaurant, the Bistro at Fantasia, which has lured a chef from Beaudry's, the  old Continental place in downtown L.A.    This should tell us two things. One, Industry is up-and-coming, no longer  willing to accept culinary dependency on other cities. Two, Fantasia expects  its nightclubbers to go for Continental food with modern touches (though the  fact that the dining room is wheelchair-accessible suggests it isn't relying  entirely on the dance crowd).    There is clearly some intentional accommodation to nightclub dining habits.  Light foods such as sandwiches and omelets are available from the lunch hour  clear up until closing time. All the pastas are available in either half or  full portions.    The specials can be a good deal more adventuresome than the regular Continental  menu, sometimes exhibiting Southwestern or Cajun tendencies (though there is a  blackened catfish on the regular menu). But not always. The special might be  something as safe and Continental as sauteed sirloin tips; actually, rather  like sirloin tips lightly stir-fried with shallots and zucchini. It satisfies  the traditional Continental requirement that food should be tender above every  other consideration.    As Continental restaurants go, the Bistro is often very pleasing. For one  appetizer, marinated artichoke leaves are mixed with crab meat. For another,  huge shrimp are floated on two sauces, ketchup spiked with a little horseradish  and a sort of sour cream tartar sauce. The crab-and-jack-cheese quesadilla is  impressively large.    And there are nice touches. A steak sandwich comes heavy-laden with fried  onions and mushrooms. The soup of the day might be accompanied by a couple of  little triangular pies wrapped in filo ("spanakopita," the waiters call them,  though technically they're boreks), one filled with sauteed mushrooms and the  other with densely packed little shrimp.    But of course this isn't exactly food you'd drive a million miles for. A nice  broiled lobster tail weighs a good 12 ounces; a nice piece of swordfish is  grilled and served with a little herb butter; nice pieces of beef, shrimp, fish  and chicken are grilled and served on a tomato coulis that tastes a tiny bit  like barbecue sauce. Rarely do you reach for a stronger word than nice.    And the kitchen drops the ball often enough. The rigatoni with ricotta and  sun-dried tomatoes has little or none of the promised basil, and lies on the  plate like a slab of drying library paste. Tournedos is a slightly overdone  filet mignon served on top of fried apple slices in a raisin and cider sauce.  It's an over-sweet dish in the Continental tradition of sticking apples where  they don't belong.    The desserts are standard issue: Lemon cake and carrot cake in the usual tall  and heavily frosted style, a cheesecake with a strange caramel aftertaste.  There is an intense chocolate cake like a brownie with thick fudge frosting,  and possibly you might find a special of strawberries and custard sauce  sandwiched between sheets of puff pastry, resting on a pool of milk chocolate.    The Bistro isn't everything, but it proves one thing. You can have a good time  in Industry. Or anyway, a nice time.    The Bistro at Fantasia, 17500 Castleton St., City of Industry. (818) 912-6065.  Open for lunch and dinner daily. Full bar. Parking lot. All major credit cards  accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$65.

The new Disney-owned  restaurant inside a Disney store at Montclair Plaza, (714) 624-8111, is  something of a suburban Toontown.    Near the front is Winnie-the-Pooh country, with a separate yogurt bar; off in a  corner is a replica of Tony's Italian restaurant, the setting for the love  scene in "Lady and the Tramp." Sing-along videos of Disney hits constantly play  on a big-screen TV (the words and a bouncing mouse head appear as subtitles).    You order at a counter that looks like a jazzed-up McDonald's. Here, the  uninitiated stare at the menu    for long periods of time. Should it be a Goofy Burger? A Supercalifragi-Chicken  Salad? Piglet Corkscrew Fries? Mouseketeer Meals (choose from Huey, Dewey or  Louie) come with a prize. If you're confused, a helpful employee will greet you  ("Hi! Welcome to Mickey's Kitchen!") and tell you that a P and J Handwich  stands for peanut butter and jelly. (Disneyland may be the happiest place on  earth, but Mickey's Kitchen must be the friendliest -- relentlessly so.)    And how does Disney food taste? A lot like the burgers you get outside Space  Mountain -- in other words, food only a kid could love. But as one Mickey's  Kitchen worker confided, "Everyone who comes here is a kid, really."

headline:   POP REVIEWS ;    CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING BY TERRY COLE-WHITTAKER   
text:   "I'm not a nightclub singer," announced Terry Cole-Whittaker at the start of  her Cafe Largo set on Wednesday. "What I am is a transformational cheerleader."    That said, the ever-smiling ex-televangelist launched into a new cabaret act in  which she sang about divinity and hosted a Vegas-style consciousness-raising  revue before a capacity crowd of doting devotees.    Billed as a preview of her planned television show, the club date also featured  performances by a metaphysical comic, an astrologer and a transcendental  meditation teacher.    Cole-Whittaker, dressed in a sequined white crepe gown, worked the room like a  New Age Doris Day, hugging customers and belting out sincere but stilted  versions of uplifting standards like "Look to the Rainbow" and "When You Wish  Upon a Star" to piano accompaniment.    Her warm demeanor contrasted sharply with the materialistic guru image she  developed during her divine prosperity days. And though her vocal talents are  limited, the fans appeared to savor every note.    Between songs, the former Mrs. California offered anecdotes about her spiritual  progress and pampered followers with esoteric banter about Tarot cards, trance  work and animal totems. "Everyone is a flower," she said, passing out tiny buds  to the patrons. "Keep cross-pollinating."    Audience participation played a key role in the program. At one point, members  of the audience volunteered affirmations into an open microphone, providing  insights like "We do not die, we graduate."    But as the two-hour show progressed, the obtuse music and humor began to drag.  Still, nothing seemed to faze Cole-Whittaker. "Don't be afraid to make a fool  of yourself," she advised before leading the crowd into her sing-along finale.  "I'm used to it." CHUCK PHILIPS

headline:   POP REVIEWS ;    TRIP SHAKESPEARE CARVES ITS OWN NICHE   
text:   Honest romanticism and winking hipness aren't supposed to work together. So how  do you explain the L.A. debut of Trip Shakespeare at Club Lingerie on  Wednesday? How a simple fairy tale turned into a novelty dance called the  slacks, how a twisted comic-book adventure became a hilarious rhyming farmland  epic of, well, near-Shakespearean proportions? And, most important, how  youthful irreverence did nothing to diminish the bare sentimentality of a  closing ballad, or vice versa?    The Minneapolis quartet is obviously a band that's willing and able to carve  out its own distinct and rewarding niche. Maybe if L.A.'s wacky metal parodists  Redd Kross had been weaned on Neil Young and the Band instead of Kiss and the  Partridge Family, they might sound something like this. The harmonies and  emotions are heartland-pure and plain, but the attitude is  television-generation-hip. The trick of the Trip is that it's never snide -- an  accomplishment that has eluded virtually all who have tried for this chemistry  (not that many have tried). And, not incidentally, the band writes great hooks,  and it rocks. Maybe the name says it all. STEVE HOCHMAN

headline:   BUSH ASKS NEW A-ARMS CUTBACK;    SUPERPOWERS: THE PRESIDENT PROPOSES REDUCING OR ELIMINATING GROUND-BASED  NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN EUROPE. HE CONCEDES WORRY ON FUTURE SOVIET MILITARY  RESURGENCE.   
text:   President Bush proposed a new treaty Thursday that could reduce or eliminate  ground-based, short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, a step the Administration  hopes will allow the Soviet Union to live more easily with a united Germany's  presence in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    Bush acknowledged that he does "worry about the military resurgence of some  kind inside the Soviet Union." Soviet generals, wary about the rapid pace of  warming superpower relations, appear to have forced civilian leaders to back  away from proposed arms control deals, senior Administration officials say.    And even though Bush denied a direct link between those concerns and his new  arms control plan, Administration officials indicated they hope that offering  to negotiate away the thousands of U.S. nuclear artillery pieces and  short-range missiles in the NATO's arsenal will ease the Soviet military's  concerns about a united Germany's membership in the alliance.    "We ought to look at ways our objectives can be accomplished that reduce the  friction or enhance the acceptability on the part of the Soviet Union as much  as possible," a senior Administration official said in briefing reporters on  Bush's plan.    The initial Soviet response to Bush's proposal was positive, with Tass, the  official Soviet news agency, declaring that the new American proposal had been  a Soviet idea in the first place.    Bush announced his new arms plan during a 45-minute press conference in which  he also:    * Said he is looking for "goodwill gestures" he can offer Iran, citing in  particular U.S. efforts to uncover information about four Iranian diplomats  believed to have been killed in Lebanon in 1982. But, he added, "there were no  behind-the-scenes negotiations that will come out" that led to the recent  release from Lebanon of two American hostages.    * Called, again, for Congress to give him more flexibility in doling out  foreign aid.    * Expressed "disappointment" with the results of his policy toward China but  insisted that he has "no apologies" for his attempts to avoid a break in  relations between the two countries after the Chinese leadership smashed the  nation's democracy movement last June. "Preserving a relationship with the  People's Republic of China in the broad global context is important," he said.    * Joked about the heckling that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev received  during the May Day parade Tuesday. "He ought to come join some of the parades I  go to around here," Bush said. "That's the fruits of democracy. He's just  learning."    But, Bush acknowledged, Gorbachev is "under extraordinary pressure at home,  particularly on the economy, and I do from time to time worry about a takeover  that will set back the whole process."    In Brussels, where Secretary of State James A. Baker III briefed NATO foreign  ministers on the new arms control proposals, Baker and NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner said that NATO allies are unanimous in their support.    But, as Baker and other officials made clear, several fundamental parts of the  new proposal remain undecided, including whether the eventual goal of the new  talks will be total elimination of ground-based nuclear weapons in Europe, as  many Europeans have urged, or only a reduction in the superpower arsenals.    "We will have to work out the specifics of our negotiating position internally  (within the Administration) and with our allies," Baker said. Many decisions  about the new plan will not be made until a NATO summit that Bush said will  take place in late June or early July.    Bush's new arms plan is part of a basic reevaluation of NATO defense strategy  to adapt to what the President called "the transformed Europe of the 1990s."    The new proposal has two parts. First, effective immediately, the United States  will stop modernizing nuclear artillery shells in Europe and cease work on  modernizing the short-range Lance missiles now used by NATO. Next, the  Administration will ask the Soviet Union to begin negotiating a new treaty on  removing the short-range weapons now in place.    Currently, NATO has about 680 Lance warheads and more than 1,400 nuclear  artillery shells, most of which are based in West Germany.    With the collapse of Communist governments in Eastern Europe and the effective  end of the Warsaw Pact as a military force, plans to modernize short-range  weapons have been increasingly unpopular in Europe and on Capitol Hill.    The current weapons have ranges no greater than 75 miles and therefore would be  guaranteed to explode within the territory of what are now friendly, democratic  nations.    Bush "only performed the last rites" for a modernization plan that was "already  dead," said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.).    "We have to realize that the situation in Europe has changed," West German  Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told reporters in Brussels. "The  American proposal is a contribution to that."    The Administration continues to oppose strongly the removal of all nuclear  weapons from Europe, believing that they are essential to maintain a stable  military balance. At the same time that it negotiates possible elimination of  ground-based weapons, it is likely to push for an increased emphasis on  air-launched cruise missiles to maintain NATO's nuclear deterrent, U.S.  officials say.    NATO officials believe that the ground-based weapons, particularly nuclear  artillery, are of limited use and could be eliminated entirely if the Soviets  would agree to do the same. Baker, in fact, told reporters in Brussels that  Washington might decide to begin removing some short-range nuclear weapons  before a treaty is negotiated.    The United States also might continue producing Lance missiles and nuclear  artillery shells for use outside of Europe, he said, noting that no decision  has been made on either of those issues.    U.S. and Soviet negotiators are working at conferences on three arms treaties:  The strategic arms reduction talks, which are designed to reduce the  superpowers' arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons; the talks on conventional  forces in Europe, aimed at reducing non-nuclear weapons and armies in Europe,  and meetings on an international pact aimed at banning chemical weapons.    The new talks on short-range missiles would begin once a conventional forces  treaty is signed. Baker said that the United States is hopeful that such an  agreement can be reached before the end of this year. But, he conceded, the  talks "have not proceeded as rapidly as we might have hoped."    "We have some proposals on the table and we are waiting for some answers from  the Soviet Union," Baker said.    Once those talks are complete, the United States is likely to begin a new round  of negotiations on conventional forces to accommodate a Soviet desire to see a  cap set on the size of the German army, according to the senior official who  briefed reporters on Bush's plans.    The Soviets have tried to bring up that issue in the so-called two-plus-four  talks about German unification, a move that the United States has resisted. The  foreign ministers of West and East Germany, the United States, the Soviet  Union, Britain and France meet Saturday in Bonn to begin the formal talks after  several weeks of lower-level discussions.    The United States, Baker said, will seek to limit the talks to the status of  Berlin and other matters left over from the occupation of Germany that followed  World War II. He said that the United States will not allow those talks to  become a forum for debating Germany's membership in NATO, which Baker called  "not negotiable."    NATO's foreign ministers voted unanimously Thursday to approve alliance  membership for Germany after completion of the reunification process and agreed  not to expand NATO military forces into territory now part of East Germany.    Bush said in his press conference that he hopes the conventional forces treaty  could be signed late this year at a meeting of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation body that includes the United States,  Canada, the Soviet Union and all European states except Albania. The conference  would meet in Paris, while the Administration has offered to host a preliminary  foreign ministers meeting of the group in New York in September.    The conference is best known for the 1975 Helsinki Accords that ratified the  postwar boundaries of Europe and adopted a variety of human rights measures,  most of them virtually ignored by the Soviet Union and its Eastern European  allies until recently.    Baker said that the 35-nation conference, once scorned by Washington as a  debating society, looms large in the U.S. view of a post-Cold War Europe. He  had suggested to the NATO foreign ministers "a number of ideas for transforming  CSCE from a process into more of an institution," Baker said.    For instance, he said, the 35-nation group could adopt mechanisms for resolving  disputes among member countries, conduct regular political consultations, and  establish a procedure for members to obtain clarifications of unusual military  activities.    Lauter reported from Washington and Kempster from Brussels. Times staff writer  John-Thor Dahlburg, in Moscow, also contributed to this report.      BUSH HIGHLIGHTS    Nuclear Weapons    Bush canceled plans for further modernizing NATO nuclear weapons in Europe. "As  democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops return home, there is less  need for nuclear systems of the shortest range," he said.    Hostages    Bush expressed hope that Iran views recent U.S. efforts as gestures of goodwill  and said "there may be other things we can do" to help expedite the release of  captive Americans in Lebanon.    Lithuania    Bush said he had no qualms about meeting with Lithuania's prime minister, even  though the United States has not recognized the republic as an independent  nation. He also sees no U.S. role in its bid to break from Moscow.    Soviet Union    Bush said that vocal opposition, such as the jeering directed at Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the May Day parade in Red Square, is  something the Kremlin leader had better get used to. "That's the fruits of  democracy," Bush said. "He's just learning."

headline:   PRO-DEMOCRACY SHIP SAILS FOR CHINA, POLITICAL STORM   
text:   It is just an old ship, once used by British oceanographers and later  discarded. But its new name, owners, destination and mission have caused the  United States and several other governments to keep track of its progress as  closely as if it were a nuclear submarine.    The new owners are a Paris-based group of Chinese dissidents and their  supporters seeking to bring democratic change to the Communist regime in  Beijing. A few months ago, the exiles bought the 1,200-ton, 237-foot vessel,  christened it the Goddess of Democracy and outfitted it with powerful radio  equipment.    Now, the ship is churning through the seas of Southeast Asia, headed for the  coast of China. There, from international waters, the dissidents plan to launch  a series of round-the-clock broadcasts beaming pro-democracy messages to the  Chinese mainland.    China is not amused. The Chinese government has been making menacing statements  about the Goddess of Democracy, leaving open the possibility that it may try to  seize or take some military action against the ship if it begins offshore radio  transmissions.    "It is something we cannot tolerate," a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign  Ministry said last month. ". . . We believe that countries friendly towards  China will not support the activities of the ship."    Because of China's warnings, officials in Washington, London, Paris, Taipei and  Singapore have been working overtime to make sure that the voyage of the God  dess of Democracy doesn't turn into a serious diplomatic or even military  incident.    On Wednesday, the ship's crew shelved previously announced plans to dock in the  Taiwan port of Keelung. U.S. sources confirmed that the Bush Administration  earlier had voiced concern to Taiwan about a possible military confrontation  with China over the ship. Christophe Nick, a French journalist aboard the  vessel, told reporters that the Keelung port call was canceled because "the  pressure on Taiwan is very hard."    Similarly, David Wilson, the British governor of Hong Kong, said Thursday that  the Goddess of Democracy will be denied entry to Hong Kong.    "We have a policy here of making sure that Hong Kong is not used as a  battlefield for other people's political battles," Wilson told reporters. "It  would be quite inconsistent with that policy to have a ship of that sort coming  into Hong Kong."    Hong Kong, a British colony, reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and is  sensitive about relations with Beijing.    One Bush Administration official branded the effort to launch pro-democracy  broadcasts to the Chinese mainland as "provocative." U.S. officials have been  checking to make sure no American citizens are aboard. The ship's crew is  French and there are journalists from France and Taiwan on board.    For American officials, the main worry is that the ship could touch off a new  round of friction between China and Taiwan, which in turn would pose a serious  dilemma for the United States. Since 1979, the United States has recognized  Beijing as the legal government for all of China, but it also has maintained  friendly, informal links with the Nationalist government on Taiwan.    The Chinese dissidents have talked of having the Goddess of Democracy anchor  off the China coast near Quemoy and Matsu -- the two islands in the Taiwan  Strait that Communist Chinese forces shelled in the late 1950s in an episode  that nearly led to war.    Members of the Paris organization, A Boat for China, which is sponsoring the  ship, have acknowledged that some of the $1.5 million raised for the project  came from Taiwan. It is not clear whether this money came from the government  or independent private sources.    Citing the funding from Taiwan as evidence, the official Chinese news service  warned Sunday: "In supporting the Goddess of Democracy ship, the Taiwan  authorities are taking a new step to oppose the Chinese government and to  create disturbances on the Chinese mainland."    In recent days, China has been hammering away at the theme that broadcasts by  the Goddess of Democracy would be illegal, even if the ship stays in  international waters. China argues that the ship would be, in effect, a pirate  broadcaster, operating without the approval of the International  Telecommunications Union. In the past, the United States and several European  governments have all objected to pirate commercial stations broadcasting from  international waters adjacent to their territory.    The Voice of America beams both shortwave and AM broadcasts to China from its  huge transmitters in the Philippines, and the British Broadcasting Corp. airs  programs to China from Hong Kong. Over the past year, China has tried to jam  the VOA and BBC broadcasts, but with only intermittent success.    According to one intelligence source, last year China bought two special mobile  jamming units from France that could be used against the ship's broadcasts.    However, the Goddess of Democracy reportedly will be equipped with special  transmitting equipment, also from France, that has the capacity to overcome  these jamming units.    The radio ship was named after the haunting white statue resembling the  American Statue of Liberty that was erected in Beijing's Tian An Men Square by  pro-democracy demonstrators last spring. The vessel left the French port of La  Rochelle on March 17. Organizers have said that on the way to Asia, Chinese  ships followed the ship and harassed it.    So far, Singapore has been the only government willing to risk offending China  by helping the Goddess of Democracy. Ignoring the Chinese warnings, the island  state allowed the vessel to dock there Wednesday to refuel and take on new  supplies and 10 more French journalists.    "Singapore is a free port, and we are open to any ship calling at our port as  long as it does not violate our law or threaten our national security," said  Valerie Mok, an official of the Port of Singapore Authority.

headline:   MEXICO OFFICIAL ALLEGEDLY WAS AT KIDNAP TALK   
text:   Mexico City's current chief of police was present at one of the meetings where  the kidnaping of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena was planned, federal  prosecutors have alleged in court documents filed in Los Angeles.    The U.S. prosecutors said Javier Garcia Paniagua was among 10 men -- ranging  from drug traffickers to top Mexican law enforcement officials -- who met in  Guadalajara in October, 1984, to discuss "a DEA agent that was causing  significant problems," according to a prosecution document filed this week in  preparation for a major trial involving four suspects indicted in Camarena's  murder.    Garcia, who has not been indicted in the Camarena case, was Mexico's secretary  of state from 1976 to 1982 and later served as president of that country's  leading political party, PRI.    A controversial figure, Garcia is a former director of Mexico's federal  security police, which has seen several of its officials implicated in drug  trafficking. When he was appointed Mexico City's police chief in January, 1989,  congressional sources in Washington and U.S. law enforcement agents on both  sides of the border expressed dismay.    Garcia could not be reached for comment Thursday, but Mexico's consul general  in Los Angeles, Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, expressed surprise at the latest  U.S. allegation.    "I had never heard the name of Garcia Paniagua in this case," he said. "I don't  know where they get this information. I am going to send this to Mexico."    The disclosure is likely to further inflame tensions between the United States  and Mexico.    Mexican officials have claimed that a "rogue" unit in the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration orchestrated the April 2 kidnaping of a Guadalajara doctor, who  was flown across the border by bounty hunters to face prosecution in the  Camarena case.    Mexico's attorney general, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, has continually  maintained that all of the people responsible for Camarena's slaying have been  brought to justice. About two dozen people have been convicted in Mexico of  involvement in Camarena's abduction and murder. Three people are also serving  jail terms in the United States.    The DEA has relentlessly pursued Camarena's killers, claiming that the  conspiracy to kidnap the agent involved several former high-ranking Mexican law  enforcement officials.    Camarena, who worked undercover for the DEA, had incurred the wrath of Mexican  drug kingpins by tipping authorities to vast marijuana fields in the Mexican  countryside. A subsequent raid by authorities reputedly cost traffickers  billions of dollars in lost street sales.    The alleged plotters "agreed that something would have to be done about him,"  prosecutors said.    Camarena was kidnaped off a Guadalajara street in February, 1985, and taken to  a house owned by convicted drug trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. He was  interrogated and tortured. His mutilated body was found at a ranch 65 miles  from Guadalajara a month later.    The prosecution memorandum submitted by assistant U.S. attorneys Manuel Medrano  and John Carlton states that the meeting Garcia attended was the second of two  gatherings held in October, 1984, at the home of Javier Barba Hernandez, who is  identified as a chief lieutenant of the Guadalajara narcotics cartel. Barba was  killed in a shoot-out with Mexican federal police last year.    Also attending the meeting, according to the document, were Honduran drug  kingpin Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros; Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former director of  the Mexican federal security police; Miguel Aldana Ibarra, a former director of  Interpol in Mexico; Caro Quintero; drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo;  Mexican businessman Ruben Zuno Arce; Armando Pavon Reyes, Ibarra Herrera's  chief aide, and drug trafficker Manuel Salcido.    All but Salcido, who remains a fugitive on unrelated charges, and Garcia, have  been indicted in the Camarena case.    Defense attorneys in the impending trial said this was the first time that  Garcia's name has been raised in connection with the kidnaping and that no  material on him had been turned over by prosecutors. "This raises more  questions than it answers," one defense lawyer said.    Defense attorneys were divided over the possibility that Garcia would testify  at the trial.    According to the new prosecution memo, there were a total of four meetings held  to discuss what to do about Camarena. The only reference to Garcia is that he  attended the second meeting.    At the third meeting, held in December, 1984, Camarena's photograph was passed  around and conspirators said they were "going to take care of him," the memo  said. The final meeting was held in early February, 1985, just a few days  before Camarena was kidnaped.    "Corruption amongst Mexican high-ranking government and law enforcement  officials was pervasive," according to the prosecution's trial brief. "Law  enforcement officials were on the traffickers' payroll, and facilitated matters  by providing protection for marijuana and cocaine loads, and escorting  marijuana shipments being transported and smuggled into the United States."    One defense lawyer said the trial brief "confirms, once again, that the Mexican  government is on trial."

headline:   3 OF 5 CHICKENS IN U.S. TEST FOUND TO HAVE SALMONELLA   
text:   Salmonella levels in raw chicken are much higher than previously believed,  according to a recent federal study in which almost three out of five birds  tested positive for the potentially harmful bacteria.    An independent laboratory test conducted for The Times also found the more than  50% of the locally purchased chicken showed evidence of salmonella.    The findings could be a setback for the poultry industry, which has spent the  past several years recovering from publication of 1985 federal estimates that  one in three birds were believed to carry the pathogen.    Salmonella is the leading cause of diagnosed food-borne illness in the United  States. There are an estimated 2 million to 4 million cases of Salmonellosis  each year. The disease also kills about 2,000 people annually, according to  federal health statistics.    The U.S. Department of Agriculture report found the incidence of salmonella  bacteria on fresh carcasses obtained from five processing plants in Georgia was  57.5%. Georgia was selected for the research project because it is a leading  poultry producing state.    Department of Agriculture officials downplayed the study results, saying the  salmonella levels discovered are minute and as such, the bacteria's presence  poses no health threat if the meat is properly stored, handled, cooked and  served.    Nevertheless, earlier this week the federal government approved irradiation, a  controversial food processing technique, for use on poultry as a means of  controlling salmonella and other bacteria.    USDA's critics argue that salmonella bacteria can multiply under the right  conditions, allowing just a few cells to reproduce rapidly. Illness could occur  if contaminated raw chicken comes into contact with other foods that are  consumed raw.    The sale of raw meats containing bacteria such as salmonella is not illegal.  Health officials reason that if the meat is properly refrigerated, handled and  cooked, any pathogen present will be destroyed.    California chicken producers have long maintained that the salmonella rate of  their chickens is lower than the national average due to the state's drier  growing conditions, among other factors. However, 52% of raw chickens purchased  by The Times from five Los Angeles County and six Orange County markets in  recent days tested positive for salmonella bacteria, with only Zacky Farms and  Randall Farms showing no contamination.    The sample was randomly selected from major California chicken suppliers, but  not necessarily representative of all poultry products available.    The 21 raw chicken products were tested for The Times by Michelson Laboratories  in Commerce using a procedure approved by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration. The procedure tests for the presence of, rather than the amount  of, salmonella.    Those brands that tested positive included 2 whole Rocky the Range Chickens  from Pine Ridge Ranch in Sebastopol; 1 whole Pride Roaster chicken from Pat  &amp; Sons Poultry in Los Angeles; 2 whole Tyson Chickens from Springdale,  Ark.; and 6 Foster Farms of Livingston products, including whole birds and  packaged parts.    Products without evidence of salmonella were 7 Zacky Farms products, including  whole birds and packaged parts, 2 Foster Farms whole birds and a package of  Randall Farms chicken breasts.    Former Foster Farms executive David M. Theno, who is now a consultant to the  firm, said that the incidence found in The Times test was much higher than  those being found in the Livingston plant. Nevertheless, he added that  consumers must keep in mind that raw chicken products are "to be cooked before  consumption, therefore any bacteria present should be killed by the heating  process."    "People think that if salmonella is in a product then you're going to  automatically get sick. That is not the case," he said. "Whether its 35% or 50%  of the chickens that contain salmonella there is nowhere near that many  illnesses (as a result)."    Bart Ehman, co-owner of Pine Ridge Ranch, which produces the antibiotic-free  Rocky The Range Chicken, said that all poultry producers battle a salmonella  problem.    "We've tested ourselves for salmonella and it does occur occasionally," he  said. "We're not worse off than anybody else and we do everything to avoid  salmonella, we really do. Sometimes, often times, when we test we do not find  salmonella. And sometimes we find some."    Corky Bennish, a principal owner of Pat &amp; Sons Poultry in Los Angeles, did  not have any comment on the lab results. However, he added that his firm did  "everything we can to keep the product wholesome according to USDA standards."    Bob Justice, executive vice president of Tyson, said that his firm's laboratory  analyses do not indicate problems with salmonella and that those Tyson chickens  purchased by The Times must have "picked up some (bacteria) along the line."    Zacky Farms declined to comment.    Industry officials, who saw a 5% decline in chicken sales after release of the  government's 1985 study, attribute the increase in salmonella levels in the  latest study to the use of more sensitive laboratory detection methods and not  to a rise in the contaminant's presence in the nation's broiler flock.    Even so, critics of the USDA say the findings indicate the agency is doing  little or nothing to reduce the incidence of salmonella in chicken.    "The USDA policy on controlling bacterial contamination (in chicken) is a  failure," said Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition  Institute, a Washington-based consumer group.    "They have been unable to get the industry to address the problems of  contamination and have given up," Leonard said. "The only thing USDA can do is  find something (irradiation) that can treat the chickens after they leave the  plant."    The recent study was done by Roy C. Blankenship, research leader of the poultry  microbiological safety unit at the USDA's Agriculture Research Service in  Athens, Ga. Blankenship said his data will appear in the August issue of  Poultry Science Journal.    Blankenship was studying a chlorine washing technique to rid birds of fecal  contamination. He studied 1,500 chickens from five Georgia processors and in  the course of the study determined that salmonella was present in 57.5% of the  birds.    "People should be aware that there is a hazard, but there are a lot of other  hazards in life and you do things to avoid them," he said. "The emphasis should  be on good food handling practices in the kitchen."    Bill Roenigk, spokesman for the National Broiler Council, which represents 90%  of the nation's chicken producers, said: "The methods (Blankenship) used were  more sensitive than previous ones. He could pick up several (microscopic) cells  of salmonella per carcass. While salmonella would be present, a few cells will  not make you ill."    Some industry observers questioned whether the five processing plants in the  Blankenship study were state-of-the-art facilities. However, Blankenship said  that the plants were well-managed, modern facilities operating within the  regulations established by the USDA and under the agency's supervision.    Even so, a top USDA official said Blankenship's results are not cause for  alarm.    "(Some critics) say that because 57% of the chickens had at least one  salmonella organism per carcass that this has public health consequences. It  does not," said Lester Crawford, director of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection  Service. "If we find just one organism, then (the entire bird) is classified as  positive for salmonella. But I don't want anyone to think you can get sick from  that. . . . Even if you ate raw chicken that contained one salmonella cell, it  wouldn't make you sick."    Crawford said health officials believe as many as 500,000 salmonella cells are  required to make a healthy person ill. However, the number needed to cause  Salmonellosis declines, sometimes dramatically, for those in the high-risk  groups including infants, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems  such as cancer or AIDS patients, for whom the disease can be fatal.    Salmonellosis can cause flu-like symptoms such as nausea, fever, abdominal  pains, headaches and vomiting.    Consumers can protect themselves from potential salmonella bacteria by cooking  chicken thoroughly, or to an internal temperature of between 175 degrees and  180 degrees. Raw chicken should be handled carefully so it does not come into  contact with other foods to be consumed uncooked, such as salad ingredients.    All surfaces -- cutting boards, knives, containers that come in contact with  raw chicken should be thoroughly cleansed with hot water and soap after use.  Packaged chicken stored in the refrigerator should be placed on a plate or  container so that none of the product's fluid drips onto other items creating a  phenomena known as cross-contamination.

headline:   CAMPAIGN TALK;    A WEEKLY WINDOW ON THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS.   
text:   3 days left to register to vote before the May 7 dealine.    36 days left until the June 5 primary election    Reporter shopping: At long last, Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de  Kamp have agreed upon their Los Angeles debate -- May 20 at 4:30 p.m. on KCBS.  Insiders note, however, that negotiations between the two campaign staffs  involved efforts at "reporter shopping." The campaigns weighed offers from  rival stations as to which outlets might insist on including their own  aggressive reporters. The agreement signed by the candidates reserves for  themselves and KCBS to pick the panel. The process left a couple of television  journalists feeling blacklisted and others worrying that they might be  perceived as handpicked stooges if they participate.    KCBS News Director Michael Singer said, "My interest in this situation is to  get what I consider the best qualified reporters in this town."    In a separate development, the campaigns changed channels for their May 13  debate in San Francisco. The new agreement calls for the debate to air on  KRON-TV at 8 p.m. This in place of an afternoon session on KPIX.    Political shadings: Wesley Sanders Jr., the treasurer in Compton, is running a  serious but largely unheralded campaign for state treasurer against a candidate  with name recognition and political connections that Sanders can only dream  about. His opponent in the Democratic primary is Kathleen Brown, daughter and  sister of former governors. "I am not a rich man," Sanders said in a recent  speech, "and although I come from a good family, they are not known across the  state."    Then Sanders, who is black, closed his speech with this: "If you insist on  voting for a Brown for treasurer, vote for me. There is nobody running for  office who is any browner than me."    Assembly update: Lynwood City Councilwoman Evelyn Wells walked away with the  California Democratic Council's endorsement for her bid in the crowded 48th  Assembly District primary. Wells was tough to beat: She serves as the council's  controller.    The endorsement will compete with the official party imprimatur bestowed on  Marguerite Archie-Hudson, another of the four Democrats running for the  nomination. Archie-Hudson also has won the moneyed nods of Speaker Willie Brown  (D-San Francisco) and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who is  giving up her seat to run for Congress.    Meanwhile, candidate Rod Wright has been organizing a swelling church-based  grass-roots effort. And Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell has hired  San Francisco-based campaign consultant Clint Reilly, who was running Dianne  Feinstein's gubernatorial campaign until a celebrated tiff last summer.    Looking ahead: Cathy Calfo, executive director of the California Democratic  Party and right-hand woman to Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr., is on her way out.

headline:   GOLAND GUILTY OF ILLEGAL DONATION TO HELP CRANSTON;    POLITICS: BUSINESSMAN IS ACQUITTED OF FOUR OTHER COUNTS STEMMING FROM  CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE 1986 CAMPAIGN.   
text:   Los Angeles businessman Michael R. Goland, a major pro-Israel contributor to  political campaigns, was convicted in federal court Thursday on one misdemeanor  count of making an illegal donation designed to help the 1986 reelection bid of  Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.).    But at the same time, Goland, 43, was acquitted on four other counts of  conspiracy and making false statements, and the jury deadlocked on a felony  false-statement count.    This was his second trial, the first having ended in a jury deadlock last July.    Sentencing on the one count on which Goland was convicted was set by U.S.  District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew for July 16 in Los Angeles. Goland could receive  up to one year in jail and be fined up to $360,000.    According to court testimony, Goland secretly contributed $120,000 to Edward B.  Vallen, the right-wing American Independent Party's candidate in the 1986 U.S.  Senate race, in order to finance a last-minute advertising campaign by Vallen  designed to draw votes away from Cranston's Republican opponent, Rep. Ed  Zschau.    There was no evidence that Cranston knew of the plan, and the senator was never  implicated in the charges of election law violation brought against Goland.    The Vallen ads financed by Goland said that Vallen was a far better  conservative than Zschau and Republicans ought to vote for him. In the election  returns, Vallen received 109,916 votes, about 5,000 more than the margin by  which Cranston defeated Zschau.    It was only revealed later that Goland was the actual contributor, since the  contributions had been funneled through a large group of other people, some of  them Goland friends and associates, others recruited by third parties, and had  been reported under other names.    An irony in the donations to Vallen is that many of them were initially  reported as coming from orthodox Jews highly supportive of Cranston and Israel.  Vallen, on the other hand, had made statements critical of "Zionists." He  insisted later he had no idea of where his contributions were coming from.    Goland has been a controversial donor since waging a $1.1 million personal  campaign in 1984 to defeat Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), who was viewed as  critical of Israel. He has also spent heavily on other campaigns.    Under election laws, there are no limits on what anyone can spend on an  independent campaign for or against anyone. But there are limits of $2,000 --  $1,000 in both the primary and the general election -- on donations to a  candidate's campaign, and Goland's contributions to Vallen far exceeded those  limits.    The jury Thursday accepted government prosecutors' contentions that Goland had  made an illegal contribution, but it did not accept their contentions that he  had conspired to put together the scheme and then had lied about it.    Goland's attorneys, led by Nathan Lewin of Washington, portrayed him as having  been led astray by inept campaign consultants hired to arrange the matter.    After the verdict, Assistant U.S. Atty. George Newhouse, the chief prosecutor,  said he was "disappointed" at the acquittals, "but we're pleased he was  convicted on the one count."    Newhouse did not directly answer the question of whether the prosecution would  recommend that Goland serve time in jail, saying only that his violation was a  serious one and that the government would recommend "a significant sanction."    Neither Goland nor his attorneys could be reached for comment.    Earlier in the day, one of the jurors at the six-week trial was removed from  the jury for undisclosed reasons. During a hearing before U.S. Dist. Judge  Dickran Tevrizian, Newhouse asked that the dismissed juror, Barry Kuhnki, be  ordered to report to the U.S. marshal for fingerprinting and that a juror's  note that had been given to the judge also be examined for fingerprints and  handwriting.    Tevrizian said the note could be examined but he denied the request that Kuhnki  be fingerprinted.

headline:   AZT CLEARED FOR CHILDREN'S USE, FIRST SUCH AIDS DRUG;    HEALTH: THE FDA'S ACTION IS EXPECTED TO MAKE MORE SUCH ANTIVIRAL MEDICINES  AVAILABLE FOR PEDIATRIC USE.   
text:   The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday formally approved the antiviral  AIDS drug AZT to treat children, making it the first AIDS drug sanctioned as  standard therapy for pediatric use.    The drug was approved for use for patients three months to 12 years old who  have fully developed AIDS or who are infected with the AIDS virus and show  signs of a damaged immune system as measured by laboratory tests. In the latter  group, they need not have overt symptoms of the disease. The drug already has  been approved for adolescents and adults.    "AZT clearly benefits children," said Dr. Dan Hoth, director of the division of  AIDS for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the  government's lead AIDS research agency. "With this approval, it will now be  easier for children to get access to the drug. We think this is an extremely  important milestone in the development of therapeutics for this disease because  it is the first drug for children."    Thursday's action is expected to pave the way for more rapid testing and  approval of additional AIDS drugs for pediatric use. The federal government has  been under increasing pressure to make AIDS treatments and clinical trials of  experimental AIDS drugs more accessible to children, since until recently there  has been nothing available to them. With few exceptions, it has also been  long-standing FDA policy that drugs of any kind cannot be tested on children or  made available to them until they have been studied and approved for use in  adults.    Hoth said that at least three other antiviral AIDS drugs -- DDI, or  dideoxyinosine; DDC, or dideoxycytidine, and CD4 -- are currently being studied  in children.    Of the 128,319 reported cases of AIDS in this country since 1981, there have  been 2,192 cases in children younger than 13, according to the federal Centers  for Disease Control. Of these, 1,182 children have died. There are no reliable  estimates of the number of children infected with the virus, although some  experts have speculated that the figure is as high as 10,000.    AZT, also known as zidovudine, already has been in widespread use in children  since last fall, when the FDA permitted access to the drug for compassionate  reasons while pediatric AZT research was continuing.    At that time, however, Burroughs Wellcome, the manufacturer of AZT, provided  the drug for free. The FDA decision to officially approve the drug for children  now means that Medicaid, private insurance and other third-party payers now  likely will cover its cost.    "FDA's approval of AZT for pediatric use means that the drug is now officially  considered to be a standard therapy for children with AIDS," Health and Human  Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in a statement. "This status should  encourage more insurance providers to reimburse for zidovudine's use in  pediatrics."    The drug -- whose dosage in children is determined by body surface size --  costs an average of $1,750 a year for a child. It is available in a  strawberry-flavored syrup.    "We're very excited, and we're looking now to see what happens with the next  few drugs," said Susan DeLaurentis, co-founder of the Los Angeles-based  Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which raises money for pediatric AIDS research.    "We encourage the drug companies and the FDA to test drugs faster in children  and approve them faster," DeLaurentis added. "It is starting to happen -- and  we hope they will learn from the example of AZT."    The FDA's action came after its antiviral drugs products advisory committee --  a panel of outside experts -- recommended March 30 that the drug be approved  for pediatric use.    The company cautioned, however, that children younger than 15 months of age  undergo more sophisticated confirmatory tests for infection or a viral culture  before beginning AZT therapy. The most commonly performed test for AIDS  infection only indicates the presence of antibodies to the AIDS virus and  children of that age whose mothers were infected often still carry antibodies  -- meaning that they may not necessarily be infected.    AZT, which was approved for adult use in 1987, has been studied in formal  trials in more than 200 children since 1986. Once any drug has been approved  for sale, physicians often prescribe it as they see fit, even for unapproved  uses. But in the case of AZT, many health professionals have been reluctant to  give it to children, afraid that its side effects may be more severe in this  patient population.    AZT can cause toxic reactions, which include severe anemia requiring blood  transfusions.    The findings of the pediatric trials have shown that children taking AZT  experience side effects similar to those in adults. The studies have also  demonstrated that children taking AZT experience the same benefits as adults --  that is, it prolongs survival, relieves symptoms, encourages weight gain and  enhances the quality of life.

headline:   PREVIEW / PAPAL VISIT TO MEXICO;    JOHN PAUL II: NO ACCIDENTAL LATIN TOURIST   
text:   On one of Pope John Paul II's frequent visits to the parishes of Rome, an  Italian schoolboy asked him why he traveled so much.    "Because not all the world is Rome," the Pope replied.    John Paul should know. He's been there, from Arctic fjord to South Sea island,  African slums to the sites of concentration camps in Europe. Next week: a  Mexican jail.    What makes the Pope run? He thinks it is, for one thing, a responsibility of  the office. For another, he enjoys it.    On Sunday, John Paul will begin another exhausting foreign pilgrimage, the 47th  of his reign. It will include 10 Mexican cities in eight days, with a stop for  prayers and jet fuel at the Caribbean island of Curacao on the way home.    The Mexico trip, the third abroad for John Paul this year, in effect begins a  second round of travel by a Roman pontiff who has seen more of the world than  all his predecessors combined.    Indeed, it was with his first trip -- to Mexico in January, 1979, a few months  after his election -- that John Paul served notice of a new, on-the-move  papacy. By now, the centuries-old image of an aloof, remote, Rome-bound Pope  are as dated as chain mail and daguerreotypes.    "This is not a Pope who likes walls around him," said Joaquin Navarro, who has  accompanied John Paul on most of his trips, first as correspondent for a  Spanish newspaper and later as papal spokesman. "He will not sit in a  nunciature receiving visitors. He loves personal contact, and he wants five or  six meetings a day -- not only churches, but also slums, factories, jails."    In its way, that first Mexican trip wrote the rules for all that have followed.  Important details have changed and organizational details have been smoothed,  but the practical and theological underpinnings are constants.    This will be John Paul's 10th visit to Latin America, and it is hardly  coincidental that Latin America is home to nearly 40% of the world's 900  million Roman Catholics.    John Paul has made it clear that he sees travel as a major means of fulfilling  his teaching and preaching role as the successor to St. Peter, the first Pope.  For Catholics, he is a visible sign of their faith, just as his presence is a  powerful means of cementing local churches to Rome.    "Quite simply," Navarro said, "the Holy Father believes that people all over  the world have the right to see their Pope, and he has the right to be with his  people, wherever they are."    No aide would ever say it, but they all understand that the Pope enjoys getting  away from the strictures of managerial and ceremonial life at the Vatican.  Here, he is in effect a prisoner in his apostolic palace. If he wants a breath  of fresh air, he walks on the palace roof.    Often John Paul looks wan and tired when trips begin. But at their arduous end,  while those in his retinue stagger from the last accursed bus to the blessed  last plane, he seems perky, refreshed.    John Paul is as hardy as ever, his aides insist, but he is visibly older now,  more stooped, and his travels are much more carefully packaged.    For a then-inexperienced Vatican, the Pope's first visit to Mexico, survivors  say, was a masterpiece of disorganization. He had gone principally to address a  meeting of Latin American bishops wrestling with the implications of the  activist theology of liberation.    But while he was there, at the urging of Mexican bishops and with the consent  of his staff, John Paul tried to do too much. He wound up massively  overprogrammed.    This time, Mexican bishops proposed 19 stops in eight days. Vatican planners,  by now veterans of a to-the-minute schedule, cut it to 10.    The Pope will get his five or six events a day in Mexico, including a meeting  with inmates at a penitentiary in Durango. But he will also get at least eight  hours' rest every night.

headline:   PAY FOR JUDGES   
text:   Your article advocating higher pay for federal judges was rather one-sided and  failed to mention several important points. Perhaps the most important is the  retirement system for federal judges. It is the world's best. He or she can  retire at age 65 on full salary after only 15 years service (Title 18 U.S. Code  S. 371). By comparison, most other federal employees have to put in 40 years of  service to earn the maximum retirement benefit of 80%.    Another item omitted is that several federal judges now serving prison terms  would have been entitled to the 51% salary increase. More significantly, the  Associated Press recently reported that well over 100 federal senior judges (a  senior judge is semi-retired) who have refused to hear any cases since  requesting senior status would have been included in the salary increase along  with their more active colleagues.    Finally, there is a vast difference between what $89,500 will buy in Los  Angeles or Denver than in, say, Boise or Fort Smith. There should be  differences in pay levels among judges in small, medium-sized and large cities.    ROBERT PALMER    Glendale

headline:   GOVERNOR'S REPLY TO EDITORIALS   
text:   In response to my recent letter (March 15), you published three lengthy  editorials which unmasked your definition of vision: higher taxes and more  spending (March 15-17). There is virtually no limit to the big-spending,  high-tax programs you want to impose on the workers and businesses of our  state. These editorials alone call for spending an additional $2.6 billion in  the coming year and you don't make any effort to price them for the out years.    Even so, you conveniently neglected to account for many other spending  increases you have called for in the recent past. Last year alone, The Times  ran at least 70 editorials on the state budget and state programs. Only once  did you call for a reduction in spending, and that was for $50,000.    In all the other editorials, you advocated increased spending, higher taxes, or  both -- yet the costs of many of the proposals were not factored into the  spending totals mentioned in your response. Did you forget, or should we now  consider those editorials "inoperative"?    Your call to slash our prudent reserve by more than a half is not very wise. To  follow your advice would be to put California's fiscal solvency and our  triple-A bond rating in serious jeopardy.    I find your advocacy of closing tax loopholes understandable and self-serving.  You want to apply taxes to lawyers' services, but you failed to mention the  sales tax exemption on the sales of newspapers and advertising revenues  received by newspapers.    Since you have called for tax increases, can we expect that you will begin by  publicly advocating that the sales tax be applied to newspaper sales and  advertising revenues? The Times Mirror Co. can seek the introduction of  legislation to accomplish that in the state Legislature. If you cannot do this,  I think your readers deserve an explanation justifying the continuation of  these exemptions at the same time you advocate taxing lawyers' services.    In your editorials you bemoan the fact that Californians have received what you  have calculated to be $115 billion in tax breaks during the past 10 years. If  the people had followed your advice, they would have paid out $115 billion more  in taxes. I'd like to suggest that you run for governor on that platform and  bring your record of bigger spending and higher taxes to the voters. Then let  the voters decide.    I haven't received your voluntary additional tax payment.     (Editor's note: The governor's March 15 letter noted that Times Mirror Co.,  publisher of the Los Angeles Times, made $332 million in 1988 and stated, "We  will gladly accept your voluntary higher tax payments.")     After publishing 87 column inches of reply editorials, versus my letter of 10  inches, you have now published an 8-page slick reprint and mailed it to  selective persons. You have apparently decided not to "put up or shut up."    P.S. I'm still waiting for your check. Is it in the mail?    GOV. GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN    Sacramento

headline:   PAY FOR JUDGES   
text:   Poor Judge Carrigan! It was all I could do to hold back the tears upon reading  about the terrible life of Carrigan.    First, he had to liquidate many of his financial holdings in order to send his  children "through college and graduate school"; and only the finest private  schools like Notre Dame sufficed. Welcome to the real world, Judge Carrigan!  How about the thousands upon thousands of parents who earn but a small  percentage of Carrigan's salary and yet manage to sacrifice virtually  everything in life in order to help provide some degree of access to the  educational system? Worse yet, how many tens of thousands of willing young  people are forced to forgo a college education due to the severe financial  structures such an undertaking entails? Is it just only recently that Carrigan  has learned that capitalism is inherently unfair; that our society is replete  with a myriad of institutionalized inequities?    Tears also welled up in my eyes upon reading that Carrigan had to sell of "half  interest in the family's Rocky Mountain retreat." I have heard this sad tale of  woe countless times from many of the families in the inner-city in Los Angeles  whose children attend our public schools. Their hearts go out to you, Judge  Carrigan!    And lest we be accused of being sexist, let's hear it for poor Beverly  Carrigan. I mean, sure she could return to a menial and "low-paying occupation"  like "social work." But, alas, being a "bride of the '50s" who likes  "traditional things," it is simply not possible for her to work in order to  supplement the family income. Again, I believe that I can speak for thousands  of working mothers -- many of them single -- when I say that our hearts go out  to you!    One last point, Judge Carrigan. If you think you are not being paid adequately  for your abilities and worth, I suggest that you try teaching for a while in  the public school system for a starting salary in the low $20,000 range.

headline:   COLLEGE BOARD ENDORSEMENTS   
text:   The Los Angeles Community College District is at a turning point. It has a new  chancellor, comparative labor peace and an opportunity to put into effect  far-reaching reforms passed by the Legislature. The decisions made by the  districts' board of trustees, including three members up for election April 11,  will determine how well the nine local community colleges respond to these  changes, in the way they write their budgets as well as in the approaches they  use to help both vocationally oriented students and those who want to go on to  four-year universities.    We are endorsing the following candidates:    Office No. 2 -- Rose Ochi has demonstrated as one of Mayor Tom Bradley's  assistants that she gets things done. She has shown commitment to the community  colleges both by seeking appointment for an earlier vacancy and by serving on  the screening committee that helped select chancellor Donald Phelps. Ochi is a  graduate of Los Angeles City College who transferred to UCLA and later earned  both master's and law degrees. She understands the vital transfer role of the  community colleges and their importance as an entry point for immigrants.    Her opponent, Mary Louise Longoria, has solid education credentials, but we  think Rose Ochi has already proved her leadership and her concern for community  colleges.    Office No. 4 -- Attorney Lindsay Conner, running unopposed for a third term,  has helped the district develop better relations with its teachers' union. He  also has tried to tighten the performance of each campus in recruiting and  retaining students, and deserves a vote of confidence.    Office No. 6 -- Althea R. Baker chairs the counseling department at Mission  College. An attorney as well, she served as chief negotiator for the American  Federation of Teachers local in its bargaining last year with the trustees.  That union is widely perceived as having heavy influence on the college  trustees, but it is a union that seems now to want to work more smoothly with  the college administrators while still standing strongly for better pay and  working conditions. Baker and her colleagues successfully negotiated a new  contract in six weeks instead of the six months of confrontation that had been  the norm. All seven of the current college trustees have endorsed her for this  election.    Baker's principal opponent, Patricia Hollingworth, a teacher at L.A. Trade  Tech, has good credentials, especially in the area of community college  financial management. But Baker has a track record of commitment.    We believe that with the addition of Rose Ochi and Althea Baker and the  reelection of Lindsay Conner, the community college trustees will gain strength  for tackling the changes they face in the coming years.

headline:   WHAT WENT WRONG?   
text:   The 240,000 barrels of crude oil that have spewed from the ruptured hull of the  tanker Exxon Valdez since it ran aground Friday have blackened more than the  pristine waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound.    They also have sullied the credibility of Exxon Co. U.S.A, which owns the  vessel, of Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which manages the trans-Alaskan  pipeline and of the state and federal officials whose responsibility it is to  see that these private firms operate in a responsible manner.    This is a harsh judgment, but the facts of this shocking and unnecessary  environmental catastrophe make no other possible. These facts also make it  mandatory that Congress take a rigorous and skeptical look at the Bush  Administration's claim that oil drilling can be expanded into the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge without unacceptable consequences.    While the tardy and inexcusably chaotic cleanup of the worst oil spill ever to  foul American waters proceeds, vexing questions demand answers:     -- Why were the vessel's master, who has a history alcohol abuse, and two  senior officers absent from the bridge when it strayed out of the shipping  channel? Why was an unqualifiedthird mate piloting the ship?     -- Why did Exxon officials fail so miserably in their responsibility to have  an effective contingency cleanup plan in place? Why didn't they have the  requisite equipment on site? Why did the company's officials move so slowly to  contain the spill, thereby squandering the initial two days of good weather  that might have made a quick cleanup feasible?.     -- Why did Alyeska rebuff earlier offers by Valdez city officials to stockpile  cleanup equipment, assuring the local leaders -- falsely, as it now turns out  -- that the oil companies had adequate supplies on hand?     -- Why did the Alaskan state government, which has the primary responsibility  for legal oversight of these matters, fail to exercise it?     -- Why has the Bush Administration been so slow to intervene into what was  from the first day obviously a major environmental crisis?    In fact, the President waited until Tuesday before sending senior aides to the  scene of the spill, and even then seemed to express doubts that the federal  government ought to take a major role in the cleanup. Bush's approach to this  disaster is perplexing.

headline:   LIKE THE EASTSIDE PRISON, IMPACT REPORT IS FLAWED   
text:   When testifying at last July's hearing to consider the environmental-impact  report on the proposed downtown prison, a businessman commented that if one of  his employees produced a report of the same abysmal quality, he would throw it  back at him.    A three-member panel charged with the task of evaluating the  environmental-impact report will begin to hear testimony at another hearing  today. If the certification panel does its job and adheres to the intent of the  California Environmental Quality Act, it will throw the report back to state  Department of Corrections officials and tell them to do it right next time. If  the governor and the Legislature do their jobs, they will tell the Department  of Corrections not to bother with another report and abandon plans for yet  another prison near Los Angeles' Eastside.    Environmental review of the proposed prison, located southeast of Civic Center,  was seriously flawed before it even started. An environmental-impact report  should evaluate impacts from a project, identify how to eliminate the negative  ones and propose alternatives with less drastic environmental consequences.  Thus, the impact report should provide an environmental safety net to protect  residents from harmful effects.    The first two gaping holes in the safety net for the environment and Eastside  residents were carved by the Legislature with the governor's hand firmly on the  knife.    First, the governor and Legislature eliminated the legal mandate to examine  alternative sites. How can the suitability of one location for a prison be  fairly judged if it cannot be compared to others?    In a second assault on the review process, the Legislature fashioned another  unfair environmental loophole solely for the proposed downtown prison. This  allowed the state to purchase the downtown land before the prison plan was  reviewed for environmental effects. But a different standard was applied for  the other prison authorized by the Legislature. The land for that proposed  prison, located in Lancaster, would not be purchased until after environmental  studies are completed.    This difference represents a total perversion of environmental review. Either  the state so flagrantly disregarded the rights of Eastside residents that it  was willing to subject them to another jail despite the environmental  consequences, or the state threw fiscal responsibility out the window by  spending approximately $30 million on a downtown site it may never use. To make  matters worse, the city attorney estimates that it would cost approximately $60  million more to locate a prison downtown than at a comparable rural site.    The final unweaving of the environmental safety net occurred in the  environmental-impact report itself. Instead of fairly addressing the concerns  raised by residents, the report serves to rationalize the department's  predetermined decision to build a prison on the Eastside. It relies upon  speculation, irrelevant studies and unconvincing analysis to defend the plan  for the first California prison ever located in the middle of a densely  populated urban environment.    For years, residents opposed this prison because they are concerned about the  safety of their children, the future of their families and the character of  their community. It seems unfathomable that an environmental-impact report  could conclude that placement of a prison in a community that already houses  75% of the inmates in Los Angeles County would not affect the environment.  Merlin the Magician could not perform this sleight of hand.    Just consider crime and public safety. The environmental-impact report, in  effect, says, "Don't worry -- crime won't increase." This speculative  conclusion is derived from studies of rural prisons that have perimeter  security and remote locations irrelevant to the discussion of a downtown site.  And the rural sites don't suffer from the severe urban gang and crime problems  that the downtown location has. Further, the report irresponsibly dismissed the  Los Angeles Police Department's concern that gang activity may increase in  communities surrounding the prison.    But perhaps the most blatantly callous conclusion contained in the report is  the suggestion that if an escape occurs and the escapee commits another crime,  this should not be interpreted as having a significant impact on the  environment. Has the Department of Corrections considered the impact it will  have on the victim? The victim's family? The community?    The 870,000 residents who live within five miles of the proposed prison deserve  enforcement of the laws enacted to safeguard their environment. The parents of  the 45,000 children who attend the 36 schools located within three miles of the  planned lockup deserve the same environmental protections parents receive in  more affluent communities. How can the Department of Corrections'  environmental-impact report find no cause for concern regarding the abundance  of schools surrounding the prison site? The Department of Corrections has  produced a report better termed an Environmental Indifference Report.    Fortunately, this pattern can stop. The certification panel can alter the  course by rejecting the report. Then it's up to the Department of Corrections  to pull the plug on this wasteful spending of public funds, search for a more  appropriate prison site, and get on with the crucial prison expansion program.

headline:   IF YOU DANCE WITH KADAFI ON CHEMICAL ARMS, KISS THE AMERICAN MARKET GOODBY   
text:   Every day, step by step, Libya's lunatic leader, Moammar Kadafi, comes closer  and closer to producing chemical weapons and perfecting the means to deliver  them over long distances. If he gets there -- and he might well, not in years  but in months -- we've got a new and deadly ball game in the Middle East.    And Kadafi is not the only problem. Iraq not only has but has used chemical  weapons in its war with Iran. Iran and Syria are hellbent on developing their  own chemical weapons capability. And other Third World nations are moving in  the same direction.    The evil genie is already out of the bottle. There may still be time to get him  back in there, but only if we act now.    We've got the right overall policy. Our aim is to eliminate chemical weapons  entirely. In fact, we've been reducing our own stockpiles of chemical weapons  for years. The Soviets have now said they will start destroying theirs, too. I  hope so. But let's make sure this offer is not just a sham, designed to get us  to halt production of the newer, safer binary chemical weapons that we have  developed to help offset the massive Soviet stockpiles and production lines. We  have to make sure the world -- allies and adversaries alike -- understand this  bottom line: The United States is prepared to agree to the destruction of all  of our chemical weapons when the Soviets are ready to sign a binding,  worldwide, verifiable agreement to ban all such weapons.    But even as we try to negotiate this global ban, more and more nations seek to  acquire chemical weapons. We're trying to stop them by pushing the adoption of  a major international agreement to control the export of technology and  equipment. We made some progress on that score recently at the Paris conference  on chemical weapons. That must remain a top priority. But we also have to face  facts: We're not going to have a good agreement for many months, perhaps years.    We can't just sit back and wait for that day. We have to act now, with every  bit of leverage we have. If Kadafi takes that last step and starts producing  chemical weapons, we should make clear our determination to do whatever is  necessary to deny him the opportunity to use his deadly new toys.    And we have to do one other thing. According to many reports, Japanese and West  European firms, in a sickening pursuit of the almighty dollar, or yen, or  Deutsche mark, are helping Kadafi and his crowd produce chemical weapons or  develop the means to deliver them. No firm that knowingly engages in that kind  of reckless activity deserves the right to profit from the American market.  That's why Sens. Jake Garn, John Heinz and others from both parties have joined  me in introducing legislation that states this sound and simple proposition: If  you deal with the likes of Kadafi on chemical weapons, you can kiss the  American market goodby.    Specifically, the bill requires the President to investigate and report on any  firms engaged in such activity, and then bans all such firms from selling their  products in America or contracting with our government anywhere in the world  for many years.    Do we have the right to take such action? You bet we do. Our security  interests, our allies and friends, the lives of American citizens, they're all  at stake.    Do we need to take such action? We have to. If we don't, who will?    And finally, do we need to act now? We had better. Because one of these  tomorrows, it may be too late.

headline:   NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: RESEARCHERS ASSAIL LACK OF CALCIUM IN WOMEN'S DIETS   
text:   The scientific community, including the National Research Council (NRC) and  U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, has a bone to pick with women who regularly  fail to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance of 800 milligrams of calcium or  who do so by swallowing calcium tablets in lieu of low-fat foods. There is  concern that the importance of continuously replenishing the body's supply of  the mineral through dietary sources has been under-evaluated and overshadowed  by the fear of fat in the diet.    A report released earlier this month by the NRC stressed the need for young and  adolescent women to increase their intake of dietary calcium. The Surgeon  General's Report on Nutrition and Health, published last year, also addressed  this topic.    "Calcium is an essential nutrient," the NRC report stated. "It is necessary for  adequate growth and skeletal development. Certain segments of the population,  especially women and adolescents, need to make careful food choices to obtain  adequate calcium from the food supply. The committee recommends that  consumption of low- and nonfat dairy products and dark green vegetables, which  are rich sources of calcium, can assist in maintaining calcium intake at  approximately the RDA levels."    Furthermore, the report continues, "the potential benefits of calcium intake  above the RDAs to prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well-documented  and do not justify the use of calcium supplements."      Intake Drops    Figures taken from the USDA's nationwide food consumption survey found that in  1985 women between the ages of 19 and 34 managed to achieve only about 80% of  the RDA of calcium from food sources. Calcium intake for women in the 35- to  50-year-old age range, dropped to as low as 68% of the RDA -- which is itself  under scrutiny for being too low.    And since 1984, when a National Institutes of Health panel concluded that  post-menopausal women needed twice the RDA of calcium and pre-menopausal women  needed 1 1/2 times the RDA, supplement sales have "skyrocketed," USDA reports.    To improve consumer intake of dietary calcium, researchers have launched a  triple attack. They are re-emphasizing the importance of building bone during  the formative years, noting that older women consuming less than half the  calcium needed over a prolonged period can suffer a loss of nearly 5% of spinal  bone per year. They are stressing that the female hormone estrogen has a  significant role in bone loss. And they are citing the negative effects of  meeting the recommended goal through supplementation.      Best Insurance    Research data indicates that taking extra calcium after menopause probably  doesn't slow bone loss and building additional bone during youth -- when the  soft tissue inside the bones is in a continuous state of development -- is the  best insurance against osteoporosis later in life.    This was underscored most recently when studies of high calcium intake in older  rats were completed. The research was directed by Dr. James C. Smith, head of  the Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Laboratory at Beltsville, Md., part of the  government's Agricultural Research Service.    "I think there's a body of evidence that the best way is to build up the bones  before menopause," Smith said in an interview, adding, "but I haven't worked  with women."    His investigation was conducted at the Beltsville lab by University of Maryland  graduate students under the direction of Joseph H. Soares, nutrition professor.    It is scientific fact that the body's ability to absorb calcium is variable  with age. During typical periods of growth, intestinal absorption of calcium  increases, with infants and children absorbing up to 60% of the calcium they  ingest. Pregnant women use about 50% and other adults only retain about 30%.  Calcium available from supplements is often even less, depending upon the  binders used in the product, which can hold onto the calcium and prevent the  body from using it. The ability of an individual's stomach acid to dissolve the  supplements also is associated with malabsorption.    And there are other factors: bone loss accelerates naturally after age 35 and  becomes more and more difficult to retard with age; after menopause a steady  decline of estrogen -- an important component in bone mineralization -- is  observed, and the process of bone development appears to slow down as an animal  ages, making the bones solid, more brittle and thus less efficient at storing  calcium.    (Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.  But it is used for various bodily functions. These include: regulating cell and  nerve functions, maintaining normal blood pressure, muscle contraction  capabilities including maintaining heartbeat, clotting of blood and preserving  the material that holds cells together.)    "The high calcium intake did not affect bone dynamics in the aged female rats  but increased bone formation in the young rats," said Rashmi Sinha, the  nutritionist who conducted the study. "Just taking a lot of calcium later in  life, without replacing the female hormones, is not going to increase bone  formation as it does earlier in life."      Risk of Cancer    But estrogen replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk for  endometrial cancer and requires ongoing medical follow-up, according to Dr.  Bess Dawson Hughes, director of the Calcium and Bone Research Laboratory at the  USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. She is  currently conducting a five-year study of 360 post-menopausal women to  determine the benefit of taking calcium, how much is necessary to minimize bone  loss and the potential hazards associated with calcium supplementation.  Preliminary results indicate that with extremely low intakes of calcium --  below the current U.S. intake level of 600 milligrams -- there is some benefit,  even without estrogen replacement therapy.    "The study suggests that postmenopausal women most likely to benefit from  increased calcium are those who consume less than 400 milligrams a day, the  equivalent of 1 1/3 glasses of milk," she said.    "If our research shows calcium can retard bone loss in some women regardless of  estrogen, that's good news, because estrogen replacement therapy isn't for  everybody."    Osteoporosis is the gradual loss of bone mineral from the skeleton, occuring in  millions of American women (and some men), and it "goes on for many, many  years," she said. It starts as early as age 20 and continues at a rate of 1% a  year in women throughout their lives. The rate in men is about .25% per year.    This deterioration typically starts out in the spine, and manifests itself as a  compression fracture. It is a very common disorder, according to Dawson Hughes,  who estimated that one out of every four white women over the age of 60 will be  afflicted with the ailment. There are a number of factors that increase risk.    Since women have less bone to start with and tend to lose it at a greater rate  from their spines, being a female is the primary factor, said Dawson Hughes.  Being either Asian or Caucasian is another. Family history has a role, as does  a lifetime of low calcium intake. Early menopause, low body weight, sedentary  life style, bearing no children, alcohol abuse, high sodium intake, cigarette  smoking, high caffeine intake, high protein intake and high phosphorus intake  are others.    One conclusion that can be drawn is that younger women, who typically are  deficient in calcium as well as iron, should adjust their diets to include at  least three servings of dairy products and other calcium-rich foods per day,  instead of relying on supplements.    According to the National Dairy Board, a serving size is: 1 cup milk, 8 ounces  yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces natural cheese or 2 ounces processed cheese.    Drinking nonfat or low-fat milk is the most efficient way to accomplish this.  One (8-ounce) serving of fluid nonfat milk provides about 90 calories, less  than a gram of fat and 300 milligrams of calcium. The same size serving of 1%  low-fat milk offers 102 calories, 3 grams fat and 300 milligrams calcium.  One-cup of whole milk provides the most calories and fat for its calcium  benefit -- 150 calories, 8 grams fat and 291 grams calcium -- while 2% low fat  has just slightly less calories and fat: 121 and 5 grams fat for its 297 grams  calcium.      Meeting Dairy Requirement    If drinking milk is not an option, here are some dairy and non-dairy foods  which in combination can help meet the daily requirement: 1 ounce of low-fat  cheese, such as part-skim mozzarella adds 200 milligrams calcium; 1 cup low-fat  cottage cheese offers about 140 milligrams calcium, 1 cup low-fat fruit-added  yogurt, 345; 3 ounces canned salmon with bones, 180, and 3 ounces sardines, 300  milligrams.    Dark leafy vegetables, in general, are rich in calcium, but some, such as kale,  broccoli and beet greens, are the best absorbed. Other types, such as spinach  and turnip greens, contain a naturally occuring calcium binder, which tends to  hold on to the calcium.    Some processed foods, because of fortification or a calcium-salt additive used  in the manufacturing process, are also good sources of dietary calcium. These  include tofu (bean curd), canned tomatoes, stone-ground or self-rising flour  and blackstrap molasses.    In addition to increasing low-fat sources of calcium in the diet, women are  encouraged to develop a regular routine of exercise. This helps maintain bone  mass and stimulates new bone formation. Although Dawson Hughes admits that the  exact role of exercise in the maintenance of bone mass remains a little  unclear, it appears that it is "very, very important."    She said it apparently increased bone density in a studied population  representing a cross section of women of all ages -- particularly those who  previously were extremely sedentary.    In another study, women who exercised for one hour, three times a week  increased their bone mineral content by 1% over a one-year period. Those, who  did not decreased their bone mineral content by the same amount.    "If you took the balance on a daily basis," she explained, "the exercisers were  gaining 42 milligrams of calcium for their bodies. You have about 100,000  milligrams in your body, so that doesn't sound like much. But every day, day  in, day out, that adds up . . . . It's a very effective means of impact on your  bones."    To help in designing a calcium-conscious life style, consider some of the  following recipes, which are based upon a popular Oriental cooking ingredient  and non-dairy substitute, bean curd.      SIMPLY SUPER SUKIYAKI    1/2 cup soy sauce    2 tablespoons sugar    3/4 pound ground beef    1 medium onion, thinly sliced    1 pound spinach, washed and drained    1 bunch green onions, cut into 2-inch lengths    1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced    1 (10.5-ounce) package firm tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes and well-drained    Combine soy sauce, sugar and 1/2 cup water.

headline:   COOK IT LIGHT: SLIMMING DOWN A FETTUCCINE DISH   
text:   DEAR JEANNE: This recipe appeared in a newspaper recently. It's yummy, and we  love it, but a quart of heavy cream? Can you help, please?     -- LIZ DOERING, Minneapolis, Minn.      TRADEWINDS CHICKEN FETTUCCINE    2 pounds fettuccine noodles    4 cups whipping cream    1 1/2 tablespoons chopped garlic    2 tablespoons powdered chicken base    1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper    2 cups freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese    4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed    1 ounce butter or margarine    Freshly chopped parsley    Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and cool.    Reduce cream by 1/4 in saucepan over low heat. While reducing, add garlic,  powdered chicken base and white pepper, stirring occasionally. When reduced,  add cheese slowly while whipping with wire whisk until sauce has consistency of  shake or malt.    Saute chicken meat in butter or margarine in large non-stick saute pan over  high heat. Stir and break up pieces. When outside of chicken is cooked, add  sauce, reduce heat to medium and add noodles. Stir 5 to 10 minutes or until  hot, being careful not to scorch.    Garnish with parsley. Makes 4 to 6 servings.    DEAR LIZ: I agree, a quart of heavy cream is excessive -- and the fat and  cholesterol can be dangerous. There are some other problems with this recipe,  however. When I made it I realized that it yields about 16 cups, which means  that if you are feeding six people, each one would have to eat almost three  cups.    I think a more realistic number of servings for this recipe would be 10 to 12.  You will notice the difference this makes in the bottom-line figures when you  compare the original recipe as figured for six servings and the revised figured  for 12 servings.    Another change you might want to make is to cut the recipe in half unless you  are planning to serve it for company. You might also find that you can make the  recipe without the noodles, then serve it as a sauce over pasta and keep the  unused portion of sauce in the freezer.    I substituted low-fat milk for the cream and eliminated the chicken base  altogether since it contains sodium and MSG. I also reduced the amount of  cheese called for, to help lower the calories and fat, as well as sodium. This  revision will not taste as "fatty" as the original, but the garlic and cheese  flavors will be more predominant.      JEANNE'S CHICKEN FETTUCCINE    2 pounds fettuccine noodles    2 1/2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine    1/2 cup unbleached flour    2 cups chicken stock    1 1/4 cups low-fat milk    5 garlic cloves, chopped    1/2 teaspoon salt    1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper    6 ounces freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese    1 pound boned and skinned chicken breast halves, cubed    Chopped parsley    Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and cool.    Melt margarine in saucepan. Add flour and stir over medium heat 1 minute. Do  not brown. Add chicken stock, low-fat milk and garlic. Using wire whisk, stir  over medium heat until mixture comes to boil.    Add salt and white pepper and continue to cook 1 minute more. Slowly add grated  cheese to sauce, whipping with wire whisk until sauce has consistency of shake  or malt.    Saute chicken meat in large non-stick skillet over high heat. Stir and break up  pieces. When outside of chicken is cooked, drain water from skillet and add  sauce. Reduce to medium heat and add noodles. Stir 5 to 10 minutes or until  hot, being careful not to scorch.

headline:   LIVER AND ONIONS   
text:   The secret of this recipe for classic Liver and Onions is the long, slow  cooking.    Cook the onions at least 20 minutes, during which time they will develop a rich  brown color and release their natural sweet taste.    Prepare the liver while the onions are cooking by cutting it into thin, even  strips. By slicing the liver in this fashion you enable it to cook thoroughly  in only about 3 minutes. The short cooking time gives the liver a velvety  texture and helps it achieve the maximum flavor. Add a drop of vinegar or lemon  juice at the end of the cooking time to further enhance the flavor.    Peel and quarter 2 large onions and slice thinly. In large skillet heat 2  tablespoons oil, then add onions and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes.  Move onions to edge of pan, add 2 tablespoons oil and heat until hot.    Add 1 pound calf's liver, cut into strips, and cook, stirring constantly, about  3 minutes or until done. Sprinkle juice of 1 lemon over liver, then stir with  onions. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons chopped parsley. Makes 4 servings.

headline:   THE KITCHEN CABINET: A GOOD PLACE TO COOK UP WEDDING GIFT IDEAS   
text:   In the market for a wedding present? Try something for the couple's kitchen,  which is always a great source for potential gift ideas. Varying in price  range, the item could be anywhere from a nifty culinary gadget such as a small  lemon reamer to a major appliance -- an upscale noise-free dishwasher, for  instance.    The duplication problem of ending up with a bridal present that stands the  chance of becoming a candidate for store return or exchange may be avoided by  providing an unusual but useful gift. Kitchen Whiz from Seiko Instruments is a  brand new product that fits the needs of experienced and novel cooks,  particularly dieters and those who adapt recipes from publications.      More Than a Calculator    Nicely packaged, Kitchen Whiz ($59.95) is a recipe conversion calculator and  more. The first of its kind, the invention was based on an original design by  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My first impression of this  electronic device was that it seemed complicated to operate. But once  directions were read (they were rather easy to comprehend by the way), the  operation was surprisingly simple. The only requirement is to remember the  techniques, which become easier through frequent use; otherwise it's just as  easy to go over directions again.    With the touch of a few buttons, you can program and convert to the desired  number of servings from a larger or smaller recipe. Each ingredient can be  reduced or increased proportionally with a simple formula. Other applications  of the tool include controlling meal portions (which is terrific for dieters),  converting recipes from metric to English weights and measures, computing  cooking times for roasts and converting temperatures.    The Kitchen Whiz also acts as a food preparation timer with a beep, a clock, a  calendar and to say the least, a mathematical calculator. Unlike other  calculators, the numerical figures and words in the washable key pad are easy  to read and sensitive to the touch. Equally legible is the display screen with  8-digit, 12-character dot matrix. The computer measures 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 1 1/2  and is fitted with a special bar on the back for propping on a countertop or  hanging on the wall. The Kitchen Whiz operates on two size AA batteries and  comes with a full one-year warranty. For more information on the product, call  Seiko Instruments' toll-free number: (800) 837-4568.    Not an uncommon bridal gift is a set of cookware. For everyday cooking,  particularly by those interested in low-fat dishes, nonstick cookware has fared  very well in the past several years. Among the lines that have been successful  is T-Fal. Attractive, lightweight and good heat conductors with its aluminum  base, T-Fal nonstick cookware sets feature porcelain enameled pans in a variety  of colors with heat resistant handles. The custom-fitted stainless steel covers  are equipped with adjustable safety steam-vented cover knobs to help prevent  boil-overs.    The latest from this French-based company is the Classic Series ($70 for an  eight-piece set), featuring an elegant pewter gray and etched trim look. The  outside has a special nonstick coating too for even quicker cleanups.      Gift of Cookware    Introduced last fall is the Versailles line ($90 for an eight-piece set) in the  prettiest, brightest cobalt blue. Each piece features "Ultrabase," an exclusive  formulation from T-Fal that consists of three exterior layers: an outside  porcelain enamel layer, a second thermic layer for heat distribution and a  close contact layer for perfect contact on heat sources such as the newer  ceramic cooktops. The interior features a nonstick surface that has improved  resistance to scratches, abrasions and staining.    Also available are the Durabase Royale Black ($70 for eight pieces), with  high-tech black porcelain and reinforced bottom surfaces, and the premiere  Signature collection ($80 for eight pieces). The latter is Euro-designed in  handsome dove gray with white accent. Each T-Fal cookware set is available in  colorful gift packaging. Open stock pieces are available and different series  may also include a Dutch oven, chicken fryer, griddle, an oblong roaster or a  wok.      Handmade Block Sets    If you admire Corian countertops, you easily could fall for a Corian and Oak  Knife Block Set ($519) from Kitchen Kitchen in Rancho Mirage. This beautiful  block set includes a complete set of J. A. Henckels white Professional Series  knives and sharpening steel plus a pair of Henckels shears. Phil Carter, owner  of this desert specialty shop, designed the set and had them handmade by a  Corian craftsman. He says: "The white-handled knives look out of place in an  ordinary oak block, but absolutely come alive in the Corian block. The  black-handled ones are also very attractive in it, especially when the kitchen  has black appliances." After designing the block, Carter has gotten positive  responses from decorators as well as from people who have the Corian tops in  their kitchens.    The block itself ($195) is usually available in Corian white with oak striping  but can be specially ordered in a different Corian finish. For more information  call (619) 568-0620.     The Seiko Instruments Kitchen Whiz will soon be available at Home Express,  Arrowhead Business Machines, Buffum's, Federated, The Sharper Image and Long's  Drugs.     The T-Fal cookware sets are available at Robinson's and May Co and some  specialty gourmet shops.     The Corian and Oak Knife Block Set is available at Kitchen Kitchen (Rancho  Mirage).

headline:   HINTS FROM HELOISE: SOME SHORTCUTS TO EASY CLEANUP WHEN YOU'RE FLOURING A  CHICKEN   
text:   DEAR HELOISE: One of my least favorite chores is trying to get a plate clean  after using it when flouring chicken. After dipping the chicken in either milk  or egg batter and then rubbing it in flour, the plate is a terrible mess. I  scrub and scrub and eventually it comes clean.    Now before I start cooking, I cover the plate with a piece of plastic wrap and  then put the flour on it. This way I simply roll the flour and everything up  and throw it away. This sure made my meal preparation much easier.     -- BETSY C., Anniston, Ala.    DEAR BETSY: I use a paper plate and toss the whole mess away.    DEAR HELOISE: When I have leftovers, I try to find clever ways of using them.  My family hates the idea of eating leftovers, so when I succeed in disguising  them they never even know, and mealtime is more pleasant for all of us.    When I have a small amount of fruit left over, I add it to the batter of either  pancakes or waffles, whichever I prepare for breakfast. Pancakes and waffles  are now a favorite in this household.     -- GLORIA C. Phoenix, Ariz.    DEAR HELOISE: I have some burned-on food on a stainless steel pot. Is there an  easy method without scrubbing endlessly? I can't seem to find anything that  works well.     -- A READER, Los Angeles    DEAR READER: You are right, that burned-on food can be a devil to remove. The  following method should only be used on stainless steel and not on aluminum  cookware.    Preheat the stainless steel pot until it is slightly warm and place it on a  heavy brown paper bag to protect your counter. Generously spray the pot with  some oven cleaner. Allow it to set for five to 10 minutes and then rinse off  the pot.    If the food has been on the pots for a long time or if it is a heavy  concentration, it may take several applications and some scrubbing. Eventually  most of the burned food will be removed. The pan should be washed after all the  oven cleaner is rinsed off. Wash it well with hot soapy water and allow it to  dry.     -- HELOISE    DEAR HELOISE: Here's a great tip on saving bottled salad oil from pouring out  all over my vegetables.    When I remove the cap from the bottle of oil, rather than removing the seal, I  cut a slit in it. It pours out slowly so I can measure it, without spilling it  everywhere. Sure saves on the calories, and no more soggy salad.     -- JOAN D., Oklahoma City, Okla.    DEAR HELOISE: It seems I am forever dieting and when dieting it is important to  drink eight to 10 glasses of water a day. This was always difficult for me. I  mean, who actually likes to drink that much water? Certainly not me.    So, to try to help I bought my very own special glass. It is very attractive  and I use it all the time. Whenever it is empty, I refill it. It serves as a  constant reminder of how great I'm going to look.     -- KAY S., Harrisburg, Pa.    DEAR KAY: I use a beautiful crystal goblet. It does make a difference.     -- HELOISE      DEAR HELOISE: How can I clean a solid copper kettle? I answered my door and  when I returned, I found it black from being on the stove burner.     -- NINA, Metairie, La.    DEAR NINA: Of course, you can use a good commercial cleaner or you could try  our home-style remedy. Try pouring some white vinegar on a sponge along with a  sprinkle of salt and rub the kettle. The black should come off. If the kettle  is really black, you may need to do several applications. Good luck.     -- HELOISE    DEAR HELOISE: This past summer I was invited to a picnic and was told to bring  some soda pop. I stopped by a corner convenience store and bought four cold  six-packs of soda to put in my two small coolers.    When I saw the price of bags of ice, knowing the soda would be gulped down  quickly when I got to the picnic, I bought four cans of frozen orange juice and  put them in my coolers with the soda. The soda stayed cold until it was  consumed.    I took the cans of orange juice home, mixed them and drank it during the next  week.     -- MIKE, Houston    DEAR HELOISE: For years I have hassled with the 13-gallon trash bags I put in  my wastebasket. After emptying the trash, I always opened the new plastic bag  and shook air into it, spread it at the bottom and hoped it covered the bottom  and corners of the basket.    Well, it didn't work. Almost every time I threw something in the new bag, the  top part that I had carefully folded over the top edge would fall down inside  the basket.    I thought that a large rubber band (or an elastic cord that has a diameter  about the size of a pencil) around the top of the basket would keep the bag in  place. Since I didn't have either of those, I tried plain old clothespins. My  wastebasket is round and I used three clothespins spaced around the top edge.  They work well and do not interfere with me tossing trash in it.     -- MARSHAL, Waco, Tex.    DEAR HELOISE: I am a short person and I found it hard to clean a chest freezer,  but I finally discovered the trick to make it easy. After the freezer  defrosted, I got a sponge mop and mopped up the bottom of the chest. The sponge  takes up most of the water and is easy to wring out. No more bending over the  side to reach the bottom, no more wet hands and no more backaches.     -- ELAINE, Northfield, N.H.    DEAR HELOISE: My family loves frozen waffles. However, it seems that when I  would get them to the table they would be cold.    So, to alleviate this problem I now heat the syrup. I place the syrup in a pan  of hot water for about 10 minutes. Now when the waffles are on the table we  pour the hot syrup over them.    It is delicious.     -- NANCY, San Diego    DEAR HELOISE: My family loves mushrooms. How can I get them sliced so the  slices will be uniform? They look so much more appetizing when they are neatly  cut and I know there has to be an easy way to do this.     -- PEGGY, Boise, Ida.    DEAR PEGGY: You are right! There is a simple and easy method to slice them --  use an egg slicer! The slices come out evenly in just the flick of your wrist.    DEAR HELOISE: I remember reading in your column some time back several  different uses for chopsticks.    At that time I thought they were good ideas and now I can't seem to locate the  clipping. Would you please reprint this information for me.     -- A READER, Orangeburg, S.C.    DEAR READER: Chopsticks are quite handy to have in the kitchen.    They are especially good for mixing eggs. They are also handy when mixing  orange juice. You can "chop" at the frozen clump and it breaks apart much  easier.    I also find them helpful when measuring out ingredients. They are great for  leveling off just about anything.    One favorite is to use one to break up clumps of dirt in the ivy sitting in the  kitchen window.    Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.

headline:   DISEASES OF DIETARY EXCESS;    AMERICANS EATING THEMSELVES TO DEATH   
text:   The U.S. surgeon general's report on nutrition and health, released several  months ago, offered some good and some bad news.    Our abundant food supply has virtually eliminated such deficiency diseases as  rickets, scurvy, pellagra, beriberi, xerophthalmia and goiter.    But we are eating ourselves to death.    Diseases of dietary excess and imbalance now rank among the leading causes of  illness and death in the United States.    Diet plays a part in five of our top 10 causes of death -- coronary heart  disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. In addition,  diet also may contribute to other problems such as high blood pressure,  obesity, dental disease, osteoporosis and gastrointestinal disorders such as  diverticular disease.    Some of the end costs of diet-related diseases were detailed in the surgeon  general's report, along with recommendations for prevention. These included:      First Line of Intervention    Coronary heart disease. More than 1.25 million heart attacks occur each year,  and more than 500,000 people die as a result. In 1985, illnesses and deaths  from coronary heart disease cost Americans an estimated $49 billion in direct  health care expenditures and lost productivity.    The report's recommendation: "For individuals whose high total and LDL  cholesterol levels warrant treatment, the first line of intervention is diet  therapy."    High blood pressure, or hypertension. This is a major risk factor for both  heart disease and stroke. Almost 58 million people in the United States have  hypertension, including 39 million younger than 65. About 50,000 Americans a  year suffer a stroke, resulting in nearly 150,000 deaths in 1987 and long-term  disability for many others. About 2 million living Americans suffer from  stroke-related disabilities, at an estimated annual cost of more than $11  billion.    Recommendation: People need to be informed of the likely benefit of dietary  practices such as achieving and maintaining desirable body weight, moderating  sodium and alcohol intake and moderating fat, especially saturated fat.    Cancer. The costs of cancer for 1985 have been estimated to be $22 billion for  direct health care costs, $9 billion in lost productivity due to treatment or  disability and $41 billion in lost productivity due to premature death.      Reduce Elevated Risk    Recommendation: People at high risk for diet-related cancers because of family  history, obesity or excessive alcohol intake should receive counseling from  qualified health professionals to design approaches that could reduce their  elevated risk for cancer.    Diabetes. In 1985, diabetes was estimated to cost $13.8 billion a year. In  addition to the nearly 38,000 deaths attributed directly to diabetes, 95,000  deaths a year result from cardiac and kidney complications.    Recommendation: Again, more information and counseling on diet.    And the list goes on.    In the past, we all just took eating for granted. But with escalating health  care costs, we need to take another look at the food choices we make every day.    Choosing an extra baked potato instead of a second serving of meat could be one  step toward saving yourself the cost of bypass surgery.

headline:   A REASON TO AVOID NICOTINE CHEWING GUM   
text:   Question: I've been using nicotine chewing gum in a program to get me to stop  smoking. Can I continue to use it if I become pregnant?    Answer: Nicotine chewing gum should not be used during a pregnancy.    Q: I've been making a point of using skim milk and cottage cheese instead of  whole milk and solid cheeses because I was told that I would get less fat in my  diet that way. But I'd like to know what low-fat really means. If I don't use  skim milk and cottage cheese, how much fat do these other dairy products have  in them? Does it really make a difference?    A: Butter is about 100% fat, and many cheeses are at least 70% fat. As for  whole milk, one-half of its calories come from fat.    Q: My sister-in-law has cancer, and she's been accepted for a clinical trial. I  know that it involves some form of treatment, but I'm not sure what a clinical  trial actually is. Are there any risks to it? I would appreciate an  explanation.    A: Clinical trials usually are designed to evaluate a new form of treatment.  New treatments may appear to be safe and effective when tested in the  laboratory, but no one can be certain of this until it is used on humans. The  clinical trial helps determine this.    All treatments, both new and old, involve both risks and benefits; with a new  treatment, however, there may be risks that could not have been foreseen. On  the other hand, a clinical trial can provide patients with the finest in  available medical care and with a form of treatment that may be superior to  anything else they had been receiving.

text:   The U.S. Information Agency has decided not to appeal a pivotal court ruling  that found the agency violated constitutional guarantees of free speech by  denying export certificates to a group of documentary films that espoused  liberal views opposed by the Reagan administration. The much-publicized 1986  case pitted seven film makers, whose on-screen topics range from Nicaragua  under the Sandinistas to the perils of nuclear energy, against the USIA and its  former director, Charles Z. Wick. The agency refused to certify the films for  export, and the film makers charged that the agency was attempting to censor  the films' contents. The agency's criteria for determining suitability for  export certification were challenged in Los Angeles federal court and found  unconstitutional. That ruling was appealed and upheld in higher courts. The  agency this week chose not to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

headline:   JAZZ REVIEWS ;    HOLLOWAY/SHELDON TEAM AT GRAND AVENUE BAR   
text:   Going to hear a quintet fronted by saxophonist Red Holloway and trumpeter Jack  Sheldon is a little like settling down to watch a rerun of a favorite  television show, or reading for the umpteenth time a favorite novel or poem.  While you might be a bit fuzzy on the details, you know the gist of the whole  thing and are eager to be impressed again by the quality.    At the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar on Tuesday evening, Holloway and  Sheldon -- two familiar hands on the jazz scene -- offered nothing startling  over the course of two sets, but impressed nonetheless with the quality of  their art.    Holloway, an energetic saxophonist mired happily in the mainstream, is beyond  having to display the screeching high end of his instrument's range -- or its  belching bottom -- to impress. Rather, he stays firmly within the natural range  and allows his ideas to gush forth with a mature musicality.    Sheldon, his partner in this venture, was likewise able to impress with  bell-clear notes that rang true as he explored the vagaries of the written song  and delivered a seemingly non-stop series of improvised gems.    "Green Dolphin Street" is a song so overplayed that it belongs in permanent  cold storage. But this group, spurred by drummer Paul Humphrey and anchored by  bassist Richard Reid, found new life. New life was also found in the familiar  "Don't Get Around Much Any More" and "Just Friends," two tunes that featured  Sheldon's musky, yet effective vocals. Again, working from the time-honored  tradition of improvisation, the quintet was able to make each of the songs  bright and fresh.    Though a bawdy little blues from Holloway and a rollicking rendition of Charlie  Parker's "Billie's Bounce" were highlights, it was the ballad inclusions that  were particularly special. Holloway's readings of "You Don't Know What Love Is"  and "Here's That Rainy Day" were simply beautiful, with Sheldon accenting his  co-leader's ideas with sensitivity and style. Pianist Dwight Dickerson was  accomplished in both accompanying and soloing roles.    For those who appreciate old wine in new bottles, the Holloway/Sheldon Quintet  is a worthy find.A.

headline:   GEORGE O 'KEEFFE SHOW OPENS AT COUNTY ART MUSEUM   
text:   Bleached cattle bones bake in the white-hot sun, lush poppies unfurl rich red  petals, vivid abstractions reek with erotic overtones: Georgia O'Keeffe's art  has come to town.    Winding up a blockbuster five-city tour, "Georgia O'Keeffe: 1887-1986" opens  today at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Critical assessments of the  exhibit have varied, but museum officials who have hosted the revered American  modernist's show, already seen by more than 1.3 million people, call it  immensely popular. In Dallas, it broke attendance records.    Organized in late 1987 by Washington's National Gallery of Art, the exhibit  traveled from there to the Art Institute of Chicago, then to the Dallas Museum  of Art, and was initially scheduled to conclude this February at New York's  Metropolitan Museum of Art. Lenders weren't keen on loaning their works for too  long. But big crowds and a little persuasion apparently paid off.    "We were able to convince the National Gallery, (exhibit funder) Southwestern  Bell Foundation, lenders, and the O'Keeffe estate that a West Coast venue would  be not just desirable but essential," said Earl A. Powell, County Museum of Art  director. The artist's estate loaned about one-third of 101 paintings and  drawings on view through June 18.    O'Keeffe, whose giant, sensuous flowers and transcendent Southwestern desert  landscapes made her one of America's best-known and best-loved artists years  before she died in 1986 at age 98, seems likely to cause long lines to form on  Wilshire Boulevard.    Already about 45,000 tickets have been sold for the artist's first extensive  posthumous exhibit, and the County Museum's membership, which has totaled about  81,000 since 1984, leaped to 84,000 after an enrollment campaign keyed to the  show offered new members two free tickets, officials said.    Chiefly for conservation reasons, the local exhibit contains about 20 fewer  pieces than the traveling version, but it is essentially the same show, Powell  said.    O'Keeffe, who wed photographer Alfred Stieglitz, left for months at a time the  man she deeply loved to paint in the New Mexican desert, and has projected a  pervasive, though perhaps not entirely accurate, persona of staunch  independence and reclusion.    But it had been nearly two decades since her last major retrospective and,  while everybody knew about O'Keeffe the person, "a whole generation was  unfamiliar with O'Keeffe the painter," said co-curator Juan Hamilton,  representative of the O'Keeffe estate and a ceramic sculptor who cared for the  artist during the last 13 years of her life. (In a much-publicized controversy,  Hamilton's share of O'Keeffe's $79-million estate was recently reduced from 70%  to 10% after relatives challenged her will.)    The exhibit, not a definitive retrospective but a selective, chronological  survey, strives to remedy this ignorance about the artist, he said.    In addition to the artist's iconic desert and flower images, there are  O'Keeffe's early charcoal drawings -- the works that led to her professional  discovery by Stieglitz, then a leading New York avant-garde art dealer --  brilliantly colored-abstractions, views of New York and huge cloud paintings  she made in her 70s.    But the show may also shine new light on O'Keeffe's personality with a  catalogue that presents some of her previously unpublished letters.    "For the first time, people are able to hear her speaking directly," said  National Gallery researcher Sarah Greenough, who edited the letters. "I think a  very different side of O'Keeffe emerges."    A correspondence from 1922 reveals that the artist loathed critics'  interpretations of her work as "shameless" or "throbbing" symbols of female  sexual anatomy, Greenough said.     Tickets for "Georgia O'Keeffe" are on sale at all Ticketron locations and at  the County Museum of Art. Information: (213) 857-6110.

headline:   STAGE WATCH : QUESTIONS CONTINUE OVER TAPER'S 'SANSEI'; 'STAND-UP' LATEST  CONTENDER FOR MAIN STAGE   
text:   Examine the credits for "Sansei" at the Mark Taper Forum.    It was "created and performed by" Hiroshima, the band that is its subject. It  was "developed and directed by" Robert Egan. The dramaturg was Brian Kulick.    But no one wrote it.    "Sansei" was drawn from taped reminiscences by four members of Hiroshima. The  raw material was edited into a script, a collaboration between the members of  the band and Egan.    As the first Asian-American project to appear in a Mark Taper Forum mainstage  season, "Sansei" is the subject of much comment among the Asian-American  theatrical community. One question that has arisen: Why wasn't a writer hired  to tie together the band members' stories into a real play?    "It was entertaining, but there could have been much more meat to it, more  insight, more of a structure," said actress and former television producer/host  Sumi Haru. Rattling off a list of seven Asian-American writers, she said, "They  know how to put a play together. I wonder if they were asked."    " 'Sansei' is not a play; it's more of a concert piece," said Mako, former  director of East-West Players. "Each member of the band had something to say,  but it was told as opposed to shown. It lacked conflict." The Taper "deserves a  little pat on the back for doing something" about Asian-Americans, he added,  "but I wish it had been a lot stronger, more pertinent. The language wasn't  heightened. Obviously they (the members of Hiroshima) are not playwrights."    Jude Narita, whose "Coming Into Passion/Song for a Sansei" won a best play  award Monday from the Assn. of Asian/Pacific American Artists, acknowledged  that she "was quite moved to see Asians on stage (in 'Sansei'). It was a  wonderful concert." She appreciated that the Taper supported "Sansei" "to the  point of putting it into the big house" (main stage).    However, Narita pointed to the contrast between the "crafted" quality of  Hiroshima's music and "the casualness of the language" in "Sansei." "Writing  for the theater is as demanding as writing a song and deserves as much  respect," she continued. "You have to give up your commitment to the actual  spoken word (from the taped interviews) and springboard off the thoughts. By  remaining so true to the exact words, they missed the universal."    " 'Sansei' is an entertaining and energetic endeavor," wrote critic John Saito  Jr. in the Japanese-English newspaper Rafu Shimpo. But he didn't find enough  "fiber in the plot."    Not everyone missed the presence of a writer. "I don't see how a writer could  have been more sensitive, more aware," said Dolores Wong, president of Asian  American Friends of Center Theatre Group, which raised approximately $50,000  for "Sansei" at a benefit. She admitted "a certain amount of anxiety selling  tickets for a performance for which we hadn't even seen a script." But she's  now "very proud" of "Sansei," calling it "very honest, fair, authentic."    Taper artistic director/producer Gordon Davidson said the decision not to use a  writer was the band's -- and he respected it. "When we decided it would be  their story (an earlier idea was for Hiroshima to provide music for another  story), they wanted to tell it in their own words. It was a delicate  experience. I knew it would yield certain results and certain problems. Clearly  it lacks a writer's ability to take that material and transform it. But what  I've got in return is a certain honesty and simplicity."    Davidson added that "we weren't making a play. We were making something new."  However, he also said, "the logical next step would be to take that material  and see whether one could marry it with a writer. We'll play it, listen to it  and talk about how we can turn the documentary material into a more artful form  without losing the honesty."    Asked whether this process should have been completed before putting "Sansei"  on the main stage, Davidson replied: "I've got to be able to experiment on the  main stage. There's no way to do new work if you look at it as finished. Almost  all the work you do in theater is work in process." Besides, he added, a  smaller stage hardly could have accommodated the band with all of its  instruments and equipment.    Hiroshima leader Dan Kuramoto agreed that "if there is another life for  'Sansei,' we may consider (hiring a writer) then." And he recalled that at one  point in the development of the play, director Egan had furnished "a list of  writers, if we wanted to do that."    But "the veracity of the show had a raw appeal that (Egan) liked," added  Kuramoto. At Egan's suggestion, Kuramoto read some of Studs Terkel's oral  histories and used them as an inspiration.    Kuramoto himself has written plays. He studied the craft at San Francisco  State, he said, and a Bay Area company wanted to perform one of his plays when  he was only 18 years old. But he withdrew it, fearing that it wasn't ready yet.    Now 41, he's no longer willing to wait for perfection. "In theater, everyone  waits until it's too late," he said. "It's important to do it while the issues  are still boiling." Also, given the band's touring schedule, "we don't know  when we'll have another chance to do it."    He conceded that "a lot of refining needs to go into it. But I don't know of  any piece that couldn't stand a bit of touching up. I've seen many shows and  wondered what they were doing in front of a paying audience."    For Kuramoto, "how successful it is isn't as important as the fact that we're  moving in a direction that includes (Asian-Americans) above the Equity Waiver  level. Success is doing what you believe in. Hopefully there will be much  better pieces than ours, but we have to start somewhere."    Veteran actor Sab Shimono agreed: "It could have been better, but at least it's  there. I hope the Taper will bring in Asian writers soon, but at least they  used Asian actors. They could have used Joel Grey to play Dan Kuramoto."    LATE CUES: Some Taper main stage offerings do ascend from the lower rungs of  the Taper ladder. The latest candidate for such a move is "Stand-Up Tragedy,"  now playing the Taper Too and originally developed at the Taper Lab last fall.  Negotiations are under way to take it to the main stage, said a Taper  representative.    Meanwhile, Steven Banks is taking his "Home Entertainment Center" from the  Pasadena Playhouse's Balcony Theatre to the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills for  an April 13 opening. Susan Dietz, the Playhouse's artistic director, is  producing the venture (without Playhouse participation).    "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" is so unsinkable that it established a Long Beach  Civic Light Opera record for gross sales ($683,000 and counting) 45 days before  its opening on May 6. . . . "At Wit's End " has extended its run at the Coronet  through April 30. "Les Miserables" has added three more weeks; it will now play  through July 23.    Bring a non-perishable food or household item to the Doolittle Theatre box  office and you'll get two tickets for the price of one for the Saturday 8 p.m.  preview of Tom Stoppard's "Hapgood." All items will be donated to the  "Necessities of Life" program of AIDS Project Los Angeles. . . . George  Schaefer and Martin Tahse have organized a memorial gathering honoring actor  Maurice Evans, who died March 12. It's at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Globe  Playhouse, 1107 N. Kings Road.

headline:   MUSIC REVIEW;    ALICIA DE LARROCHA IN RECITAL AT ROYCE HALL   
text:   Alicia de Larrocha's latest recital program was a curious, but utterly  characteristic, thing of clear contrasts and an understated progression from  comparative abstraction to full-bodied pictorialism. Tuesday evening at Royce  Hall, she paired Schubert with an Iberian group; her previous recital here this  season had matched Mendelssohn and Albeniz.    In the overheated hall, the 65-year-old pianist began slowly, with a detached,  ill-balanced account of Schubert's C-minor Impromptu, D. 899, No. 1. She  communicated a much greater degree of involvement in a fleet performance of the  A-flat Impromptu, No. 4, in the same set.    The Sonata in A, D. 664, elicited a fully engaged performance. Larrocha allowed  the sentiment and lyricism gracious space, while keeping formal shapes taut, in  direct, evenly modulated playing.    After intermission, Larrocha switched from pastels to primary colors in oil for  a set culminating in Turina's "Sanlucar de Barrameda," appropriately subtitled  "Sonata Pintoresca." Her boldly etched, expressive playing clarified textures  and thematic links as well as painted moods with idiomatic flair.    Larrocha's complete control of rhythmic and articulative nuance, and her  formidable sense of concentrated direction, well served the "Tres Danzas  Caracteristicas" of Oscar Espla. She unwound the Habanera with sinuous ease,  let the Ronda Serrana glitter naturally, and drove the Sonatina Playera with  indomitable zest.    The "Sonatina pour Ivette" by Xavier Montsalvatge is at once austere and  playful, aristocratically ordered and vividly earthy. Larrocha set it forth  with clarity and brio, alert to inner tensions as well as surface sparkle.    In encore, Larrocha furthered the cause of sophisticated Iberiana with a  tenderly introverted account of Mompou's "El Secreto," and an intensely vital  performance of Falla's "Dance of Terror" from "El Amor Brujo," delivered as a  single fiery impulse.

headline:   TESTS SHOW ALAR TRACES ON APPLES IN 2 COUNTY STORES   
text:   Apples in two Los Angeles County supermarkets were found in independent tests  to contain residues of Alar, a potentially hazardous chemical that the stores'  suppliers had claimed was no longer used.    The tests, conducted for The Times by a private San Francisco laboratory, found  traces of Alar on apples sold at a Hughes market in Monterey Park and a Lucky  store in Bell. Officers of both stores said their growers had pledged in  letters not to use the chemical. Lucky was apparently confident enough of the  claim to post it on signs on produce shelves.    The test results demonstrate that supermarkets, increasingly sensitive to  consumer concerns about pesticides and chemicals, may not be able to guarantee  the purity of their produce without independent laboratory verification. Some  environmentalists are demanding an immediate ban on Alar.    In response to the results, a spokeswoman for Lucky said the chain pulled the  apples from the market where The Times purchased them last week and will test  them to verify The Times' findings. In the meantime, she said, Lucky's no-Alar  signs will probably be revised.    Hughes, concerned by the findings, began testing apples in its warehouse  Wednesday and found Alar residues on three different brands of red apples. A  Hughes vice president ordered its stores to pull those brands from the shelves  late Wednesday afternoon and announced that the chain will now test apples in  its warehouse on a regular basis.    No Alar residue was detected in samples from two other stores, a Vons in La  Canada and a Ralphs in South Pasadena. These two supermarket chains verify  their growers' claims of Alar-free fruit with independent laboratory testing.    The amounts detected in The Times' tests were substantially below the allowable  limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An EPA official said  Alar residues at or below the allowable amount -- set before the chemical was  linked to cancer -- could cause health problems over a lifetime of consumption  but not in the short run. The agency next year is expected to ban the chemical,  which is used to improve the appearance and extend the shelf life mainly of red  apples.    "The finding of Alar in so-called Alar-free apples demonstrates why we need the  EPA to take this chemical off the market once and for all," said Lawrie Mott, a  senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental  group that released a controversial study earlier this month about the  chemical's effects on children.      Private Lab Hired    The Times last week purchased eight to 10 apples of each red and yellow variety  at the four stores and hired Anresco Inc., a private San Francisco laboratory,  to test them for residues of Alar, the trade name for the chemical daminozide.  The laboratory used a testing method recognized by the EPA and the Food and  Drug Administration.    Of 23 samples tested, five had detectable levels. The EPA's allowable limit for  the residue is 20 parts per million. The EPA does not, however, say that apples  containing that amount or less are safe.    "We aren't saying there is any level that is absolutely without risk," said EPA  spokesman Alber Heier. "However, we think the risk is small."    Agency officials say the average Alar residue detected on apples is one part  per million -- 1/20th of the limit. For every 100,000 people who eat apples  containing that average amount, there will be about 4.5 additional cancer cases  over the lifetime of those people, according to the EPA's calculations.      Range of Findings    The amounts found in The Times' tests ranged from .97 ppm to 9 ppm. Anne  Lindsay, director of pesticide registration for the EPA, said any residue above  1 ppm probably results from current use of Alar. Smaller amounts may be found  on apples one or more years after the grower has stopped using the chemical  because it persists in the soil and root system of the tree.    At Hughes, a sample of McIntoshes was found to have residue of 9 ppm. A sample  of large red Delicious apples had a detectable level of .97 ppm and "fancy" red  Delicious had a level of 3.7 ppm.    At Lucky, a large red Delicious sample showed 1.8 ppm and a regular red  Delicious sample had 4.1 ppm.    Judy Decker, a spokeswoman for Lucky Stores, said the chain will decide whether  to make changes in its produce policies after receiving the results of its own  laboratory analysis. She noted that Lucky produce signs say the chain has been  asking growers for three years to certify that they do not use Alar.    "The sign is still correct as far as I am concerned," Decker said. "The grower  has certified to us that he has not used Alar."      Variance of Claims    But claims of certification vary, said Tom Hale, president of the Washington  Apple Commission, which represents 5,000 apple growers in the state. Some  growers certify that no Alar was used to the best of their knowledge. Others  certify that actual testing was done at harvest time.    "I believe the certifications that are occurring are honest," Hale said. "But  I'm not saying it's foolproof and something couldn't slip through."    Harland Polk, vice president of sales and marketing at Hughes, acknowledged  that levels of certification from growers vary.    Hughes will now post signs in stores informing customers that samples of their  apple shipments are tested for the chemical, Polk said. Of seven apple samples  tested by the store Wednesday, four had no traces of Alar. But some red  Delicious apples had 1.2 ppm; others had 2.5 ppm and still others showed 3.6  ppm, Polk said.    Hughes used the same method of testing as Anresco, but the apples tested by  Hughes may have come from different growers.    Polk said Hughes had letters from each of those suppliers saying that Alar was  not used on their apples to the best of their knowledge. "Those (apples) will  be pulled from sale and returned to the supplier, and if it is appropriate we  will take legal action against those suppliers," Polk said.    Stores say that once apples are on the shelves, it is difficult to determine  who the growers were.    The EPA estimates that 5% of fresh apples are now treated with Alar. Lindsay,  director of the agency's pesticide registration division, said that estimate is  based on reports from county and state agricultural officials who work with  growers, the amount of Alar production reported by its manufacturer and private  services that collect such information.    Lindsay conceded, however, that the agency must rely in part on what growers  say they are doing because "there is no official national reporting system of  what people use."    Consumers Union, the New York-based publisher of Consumer Reports, challenged  that estimate in a report showing that 55% of raw apples purchased in the New  York region contained Alar. The organization's test showed residues ranging  from .4 to 2.3 ppm on 11 of 20 samples of red apples tested.    Consumer Union called on the EPA to ban Alar "as soon as possible." In the  meantime, consumers should not stop eating raw apples "because the health  benefits of apples outweigh the very low risks" associated with Alar, said  Consumers Union spokeswoman Marnie Goodman.    Times researcher Angela Justin contributed to this article.      TESTING FOR ALAR     Apples from four stores -- Vons, Ralphs, Hughes and Lucky -- were tested for  daminozide, a growth-regulator marketed under the brand name Alar, which is  suspected of causing cancer. Twenty-three samples of eight to 10 apples each  were tested. No Alar was found in the Vons or Ralphs samples. Five samples --  three from Hughes and two from Lucky -- showed traces of the chemical. The  legal limit for Alar on apples is 20 parts per million. Anresco Inc., a San  Francisco firm, did the testing for The Times.     The laboratory, established in 1943, tests for pesticides, preservatives,  nutrients and other compounds in food, usually for private companies. The  laboratory used the government-approved PAM II testing method in which apples  are put in a blender, mixed with sodium hydroxide, titanium trichloride, an  antifoam agent and zinc granules. The mixture is heated and decomposed into  unsymmetrical dymethyl hydrazine (UDMH), a breakdown product of Alar. Results  are read in a spectrometer, with color intensities proportional to the amount  of Alar in the sample. The test has a margin of error of plus or minus 4%.

headline:   'JUNK BOND' KING MILKEN INDICTED FOR STOCK FRAUD   
text:   Michael Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert "junk bond" wizard in Beverly Hills  who revolutionized U.S. corporate finance and raised funds for dozens of  corporate raids, was indicted Wednesday on federal racketeering, insider  trading and other securities fraud counts.    The long-expected indictment also named Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, and a  former Drexel trader, Bruce L. Newberg.    If convicted on the racketeering charges, the three could face an astronomical  amount in financial penalties: The indictment asks that they forfeit a total of  $1.85 billion, representing their salaries, other compensation and their share  of Drexel profits, all earned in what the government charges was a continuing  criminal enterprise operated at the New York-based investment banking firm.      Fines Could Be Doubled    In addition, the federal racketeering law, known as the Racketeer Influenced  and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, at least theoretically could subject  them to twice that amount in fines. This means each defendant could face up to  $3.7 billion in fines on the two RICO charges. They also face additional fines  on the other counts totaling in the millions of dollars.    Michael Milken faces a maximum jail sentence of about 300 years, with lesser  amounts for the other two defendants.    The indictment apparently marks the end of Milken's 20-year career at the firm  that his junk bond operation transformed from a second-rank investment bank to  one of the powerhouses on Wall Street. Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield  debt securities.    Immediately after the 98-count indictment was returned by a federal grand jury,  Drexel said that Milken, 42, and his brother, 40, had requested and been  granted leaves of absence. John Kissick, formerly head of the firm's corporate  finance department in Beverly Hills, has been expected to take Michael Milken's  place.    The criminal charges result from the biggest criminal securities fraud  investigation ever undertaken by the government. The inquiry has been under way  for over two years. Benito Romano, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said "this  specific investigation is continuing" and didn't rule out the possibility that  additional individuals may be charged soon.    The charges filed Wednesday mean that Newberg is now facing two separate  racketeering indictments. He is also named as a defendant in an indictment  returned last July relating to Princeton/Newport Partners, a small investment  firm that did business with Drexel. The charges against him in the two  indictments appear to cover the same general chain of events.    Lowell Milken, a lawyer, gave up a promising legal career in the 1970s to help  his brother run Drexel's Beverly Hills office. The indictment charges that  Lowell "was his brother's principal adviser in the conduct of the conspiracy."    Sources at the firm said the indictment of Michael Milken probably would clear  the way for Drexel to swiftly settle civil charges filed by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. Milken's continued presence at the firm was a major  sticking point in the talks.    Settlement with the SEC, in turn, would remove the last obstacle to Drexel's  carrying out its pledge to plead guilty to six criminal counts and pay $650  million in financial penalties. The firm had entered into that agreement in  December, in part to avoid more serious racketeering charges and a possible  huge forfeiture of assets.    The 110-page indictment returned Wednesday appears to closely follow the civil  charges contained in an SEC lawsuit filed in September against Drexel and the  Milkens. It contains only a few charges that weren't in the SEC's complaint and  leaves out a number that were.    The indictment accuses Michael Milken of a prolonged pattern of insider  trading, stock market manipulation and defrauding clients. It claims that he  sought to enrich himself through self-dealing at the same time that he was  acting on behalf of Drexel's customers.      Areas of Wrongdoing    The indictment charges three broad areas of wrongdoing. One involves  transactions with former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who pleaded guilty to  a single criminal charge and gave prosecutors the information that touched off  the Drexel investigation. The indictment charges that Milken used Boesky's firm  to hide illegal stock trading.    The second broad area involves transactions with Princeton/Newport Partners, in  which Drexel and Milken allegedly helped Princeton/Newport carry out tax fraud  through sham securities trades with Drexel. Among other charges, the indictment  alleges that Drexel used Princeton/Newport to illegally manipulate the price of  COMB Co. securities in 1985.    The third general area involves alleged straight insider trading in the  securities of Lorimar Inc. and Viacom Inc. by Michael Milken.    Although the government could immediately ask a federal judge to freeze the  three defendants' personal assets, Romano, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said  he probably will not do that. He said his office has been negotiating with the  defendants' lawyers and added that he expects a bond to be posted by the three  men, covering at least a part of the amount they may be required to forfeit to  the government.      Expects Assurances    Romano said he expects to receive written assurances that assets covering the  rest will not be dissipated before a trial is held.    When asked about the huge amounts, among the largest that individuals have been  asked to forfeit in a RICO case, Romano said the numbers represented "the  extraordinary levels of compensation and stock ownership in the (illegal)  Drexel enterprise" paid to Michael Milken and the others. The indictment notes  that Milken received $1.1 billion in direct compensation from Drexel from 1984  through 1987, as well as millions in other forms of compensation, and that he  is Drexel's largest individual stockholder, owning about 6% of the firm.    According to the indictment, Milken's pay was $123.8 million in 1984 and $135  million in 1985, then more than doubled in 1986 to $294.8 million. In 1987, he  was paid $550 million. The indictment says that, during those years, Milken's  personal compensation amounted to between 28% and 44% of the junk bond  department's gross revenues.    Lowell Milken allegedly received $102 million in direct compensation during the  same period.    Drexel's tentative settlement of the six criminal charges pending against the  firm calls for it to withhold nearly all of Michael Milken's compensation from  1988, as well as about $13 million owed to Lowell Milken. But the brothers are  challenging that in court as a violation of their constitutional rights, and it  will be up to a federal judge to decide.    The $1.85-billion total that the three are being asked to forfeit was based in  part on calculations of how much each of them had received from Drexel. But  Romano said that, under the law, each of them could be held "jointly and  separately" liable for the full amount. Michael Milken has been reported to  have a personal net worth of nearly $1 billion.    Arthur L. Liman, one of Milken's main defense lawyers, said in a written  statement that Milken "will plead not guilty with confidence that in a fair  trial he will be acquitted." Liman said: "The charges against Mr. Milken are  essentially a repetition of the accusations made by Ivan Boesky and others as  they bargained for leniency or immunity from prosecution."    Both Milkens strongly denied the charges against them. Michael Milken said in a  written press release: "I am confident that in the end I will be vindicated."  Lowell Milken said that "the proof will show that I had virtually no contacts  with Ivan Boesky, and that I had little, if anything, to do with the events the  prosecutors misrepresent in order to construct their charges."    He added that "I have been thrown into this indictment because of a fact in  which I take great pride -- I am Michael Milken's brother."    Michael Armstrong, Lowell's lawyer, said in a brief interview that he found  little that was unexpected in the indictment. "It seems like little more than a  rehash of what the SEC came out with six months ago," he said.    In another statement, two lawyers representing Newberg accused the government  of seeking to punish Newberg for refusing to become a prosecution witness by  indicting him twice on racketeering charges.    "The second RICO indictment of Mr. Newberg, containing essentially the same  charges as those in the first indictment, is a total perversion of the RICO  statute," the lawyers said. Newberg could not be reached for comment. He left  Drexel when it became apparent that he was going to be charged in the  Princeton/Newport case.    Romano said that none of the three would be arrested. Instead, they will be  allowed to present themselves for arraignment, probably one week from today.  The government requested that U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood be assigned to  the case, because she is already presiding over the case in which Drexel is  expected to plead guilty to six charges.    The indictment conspicuously leaves out a number of names of Drexel employees  who reportedly have been under investigation. Several of them had received  "target" letters from prosecutors warning them that they faced indictment.  Defense lawyers said they believe that the government may file additional  indictments, or file a new indictment, superseding the one handed up Wednesday,  that would include more individuals as defendants.

headline:   DEFENSE PROBE FIGURE LIKELY TO PLEAD GUILTY   
text:   Woodland Hills, Calif., defense consultant Fred H. Lackner will plead guilty  Friday to federal fraud and bribery charges in the Ill Wind Pentagon corruption  investigation, sources told The Times Wednesday.    In an agreement almost identical to that struck last week between prosecutors  and former Navy procurement official Stuart E. Berlin, Lackner will plead  guilty in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., to charges of wire fraud,  conspiracy and bribery of a public official.    He faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison and fines of $750,000.    Lackner, 52, will admit his role in a scheme to pay Berlin about $6,000 for  inside information on two Navy electronics contracts, the sources said. Lackner  and an associate, defense consultant William L. Parkin, sold the data to  Teledyne Industries Inc., of Newbury Park, Calif., and Hazeltine Corp. of Long  Island, N.Y., to help the firms win lucrative Navy business.    With his plea, Lackner would become the 12th person to admit to charges arising  from the Ill Wind inquiry. Teledyne and Hazeltine also have pleaded guilty to  charges of conspiracy, fraud and lying to the government.    Three Teledyne officials face trial, beginning Monday, on charges of using  Parkin and Lackner to bribe the Navy official for inside information.    The three-year investigation into corruption in military weapons-buying broke  open last June when agents of the Naval Investigative Service and the FBI  searched the homes and offices of four dozen defense contractors, consultants  and government officials. The inquiry has been described as the broadest ever  into fraud and bribery in the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year procurement  system.      More Charges Likely    Federal prosecutors, under the direction of Henry E. Hudson, U.S. Attorney for  the Eastern District of Virginia, are continuing to build cases against a  number of defense consultants and Pentagon officials who have not been  indicted.    Their chief target is said to be former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn R.  Paisley, who left the Navy in 1987 to become a highly paid consultant.  Investigators are pursuing allegations that Paisley bribed his former Navy  colleagues to steer contracts to some of the nation's biggest defense  contractors.    Another target is former defense consultant William M. Galvin, a Paisley  associate and a well-known figure in the defense industry. Attorneys for  Paisley and Galvin have asserted that their clients are innocent of any  wrongdoing.    Sources said Wednesday that Lackner decided to plead guilty and cooperate with  prosecutors after Berlin, 51, and Parkin, 65, confessed to their roles in the  conspiracy. Parkin, who attempted suicide two weeks ago, pleaded guilty to  bribery and fraud charges last Monday.    The two men are scheduled to be sentenced June 3.    The prosecutor's case was built largely around wiretapped conversations between  Lackner and Parkin in which the two made veiled references to money for Berlin  as "a little green" and "a lot of spaghetti and meatballs."    FBI surveillance cameras also recorded Lackner's withdrawing money from a bank  and later meeting with Berlin, federal investigative sources said. But the  actual transfer of funds was never witnessed, they said.    Berlin admitted last week that, beginning in 1985, he sold confidential  information on a Navy electronics contract to Lackner and Parkin, who in turn  sold it to officers of a Teledyne subsidiary for $160,000.      Documents Show Deceit    Parkin and Lackner agreed to split the Teledyne fee and pay a one-third share  to Berlin. But, according to government documents, they lied to Berlin about  how much they were paid and gave him only a tiny fraction of their fees.    Teledyne, in the plea agreement under which it will pay the government at least  $4.3 million in fines and reimbursements, called the plan a "corrupt and  illegal arrangement" to subvert the Pentagon's procurement process.    Prosecutors said that Lackner, Parkin and Berlin were involved in a similar  scheme to help Hazeltine win a different Navy electronics contract. Lackner and  Parkin again allegedly misrepresented the size of their fee and gave Berlin  less than a one-third share.    Carla Lazzareschi reported from Los Angeles and John M. Broder from Washington.

headline:   HALLEY'S COMET MAY BE A DEEP SPACE 'INTERLOPER'   
text:   Halley's comet, which has fascinated scientists and lay people alike because of  its periodic and sometimes spectacular return to the Earth's neighborhood, may  have originated somewhere beyond the solar system, making it truly a visitor  from deep space, scientists reported Wednesday.    It has long been thought that the periodic comet came from a cloud of "dirty  snowballs" on the fringe of the solar system, but a new chemical analysis  suggests that Halley may be different from all other objects in the solar  system and could have been an "interloper" that was captured by the sun's  gravity as it passed nearby.    That scenario offers one explanation for why Halley now appears to be somewhat  different than scientists had thought, said astronomer Susan Wyckoff of Arizona  State University.    Using a technique that has allowed astronomers to examine the chemical  composition of a comet for the first time, Wyckoff and a team of researchers  discovered that the ratio between carbon 12 and carbon 13 in Halley "differs  from all other solar system objects examined, including terrestrial and lunar  rocks, meteorites and the atmospheres of large planets," she said.    The National Science Foundation, which sponsored the research along with the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, announced the results Wednesday.  The findings are also reported in the April 1 issue of the Astrophysical  Journal.    The scientists used a sensitive instrument that reveals the chemical  composition of a celestial body through a process called "spectral analysis."    She said even an instrument as sensitive as the one used by the team is  effective only on bright objects. The big question now remaining is whether any  other comets have the same composition as Halley.    "There's another bright one coming in sometime this summer," Wyckoff said. That  comet, called Brorsen-Metcalf, should be bright enough for chemical analysis,  and like Halley, it passes this way rarely.    If it turns out that Halley is different than all other comets, "it might mean  that it was a captured comet," she said. "The sun just ventured too close to an  interloper comet" and the comet became trapped in the sun's gravitational  field.    That would explain one thing that has mystified scientists for centuries:  Halley travels in the wrong direction as it orbits the sun.    "Only five out of 124 (periodic comets that return again and again to the inner  solar system) go around the sun backwards," she said. "People have been puzzled  by that."    That could be explained if Halley was an interloper captured by the sun's  gravity and it entered the solar system in such a way that it ended up going  around the sun in the opposite direction of nearly everything else.    An alternative reason could be that a star exploded nearby just as the our sun  was forming, "splattering parts of the solar system with carbon 12 material,"  Wyckoff said. Some materials, possibly similar to whatever formed Halley's  comet, may have been somehow shielded from the blast and ended up with less  carbon 12 than others.    That could explain why the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is 89 to 1  throughout most of the solar system, including on Earth, and only 65 to 1 in  Halley's comet, according to the new findings.    Whatever the explanation, Halley's comet continues to engage the astronomical  community despite the fact that it long ago disappeared from the southern sky  on its journey back toward the outer edge of the solar system. It takes about  76 years for the comet to complete one orbit, and it has been observed for more  than 3,000 years.

text:   Powerful thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in Texas and Louisiana and dumped more  than a foot of rain in some areas, while a low pressure system left nearly a  foot of snow on the Upper Plains. The National Weather Service said tornadoes  touched down near Nacogdoches, Lufkin and Huntington, Tex., and Anacoco, La.  There were no reports of injuries or serious damage. More than 14 inches of  rain fell at Longview and 13 inches at Henderson, Chalk Hill and Atlanta in  east Texas, the weather service said. Six inches fell at Hope, Ark., and nearly  that much at Texarkana. Some roads were flooded and others were washed out in  northeast Texas. Some homes in Texarkana reported 2 feet of water inside. A dam  failed near Henderson and some people had to be rescued from trees by boaters.  In Panama, Okla., the Poteau River was 6 feet above flood stage. The weather  service reported 11 inches of snow at Petersburg, N. D., 7 inches at Larimore  and 4 inches at Grand Forks.

headline:   EXPERTS HOPE BRIDGE FALL WON'T DELAY TROLLEY LINE   
text:   Los Angeles County transit officials were cautiously optimistic Wednesday that  the collapse of a partly completed 400-ton trolley bridge will not  significantly delay the summer, 1990, scheduled opening of the first line of  the region's multibillion-dollar mass transit system.    While the cause of Tuesday morning's spectacular accident was still to be  determined, contractors were developing plans to make up construction time lost  when the concrete trestle for the Los Angeles-to-Long Beach trolley fell onto  Firestone Boulevard in an unincorporated area of South Los Angeles.    Eight people were injured, none seriously. They included two men who were  trapped in a pickup truck that was crushed by the falling bridge, five bridge  workers and a pedestrian.    Workers moved quickly to reopen the busy thoroughfare, which officials  originally predicted might be blocked for three days. By early Wednesday  morning, the 110-foot span had been broken up and removed and all four lanes  were open to traffic.    Meanwhile, an interagency team of state and county engineers began a  two-pronged investigation to determine the cause of the near-tragedy and to  ensure that other bridge-building projects in the county are safe.    Attention focused on the timber-and-steel temporary structure that had  supported the bridge. One transit official told The Times that, for no apparent  reason, the temporary support structure, or "falsework," appeared to shift  several feet and toppled "like a domino."    There was still no estimate of total damage Wednesday. But officials with the  county Transportation Commission, which is building the trolley system, said  their insurance would cover losses.    The $720-million, 22-mile Long Beach trolley, dubbed the Blue Line, is about  70% complete and will be the first in the system to carry passengers.    A segment from Long Beach to the southern edge of the Central City financial  district is scheduled to open in July, 1990. A final leg, which will drop into  a subway station beneath 7th and Flower streets in downtown Los Angeles, is not  expected to open until 1991.      Connecting Links    The Blue Line will connect with the Metro Rail subway, or Red Line, and the  Century Freeway trolley, or Green Line, which are both scheduled to open in  1993.    Tuesday's bridge collapse was the largest mishap so far in the county's  ambitious mass transit construction program, which includes the RTD's Metro  Rail subway and the commission's trolley lines that planners hope will some day  extend for 150 miles. Thus far, the mass transit program's problems mostly have  been construction delays.    Last year, however, there was an embarrassing foul-up on another Long Beach  trolley bridge being built across Compton Creek. Cracks developed in the  surface of the bridge because steel reinforcing was placed improperly and  commission inspectors did not catch it. The problem has since been corrected,  with the contractor agreeing to pick up the added costs.    The investigation of Tuesday's collapse -- a mishap that engineering experts  described as highly unusual -- was expected to take several weeks. A task force  of bridge experts and public works engineers from Caltrans, the county Public  Works Department and the Transportation Commission was being assembled  Wednesday.    "We're going to get in there and do a thorough investigation and analysis of  exactly what occurred," said Ed McSpedon, the commission's rail construction  chief. "What we do know is that something unusual happened on that south  abutment" where the trestle fell.      Temporary Structure    McSpedon has emphasized that it was a temporary support structure that failed,  not the bridge itself. He noted that the span was "still very much intact"  after the accident, he said.    Concerns about the quality of construction on the Firestone bridge contract,  which includes two separate spans, were raised last year in an internal memo by  a design engineer on the project.    Those concerns included possible soil settlement problems with a temporary  support structure similar to the one that apparently failed Tuesday, as well as  the need for field engineers to be more aggressive in enforcing contract  requirements.    A Transportation Commission official insisted Wednesday that those concerns  were addressed shortly after they were raised last year, as the first of the  two spans was being built.    "All of the issues were responded to and reviewed," said commission spokeswoman  Erica Gobel. She said the memo was part of the "normal checks and balances" and  "healthy dialogue" between engineers on such projects.    The engineer, who works for a consulting consortium hired by the commission,  has declined to comment. He referred inquiries to the commission.    Gobel said it is the commission's policy that its own officials, rather than  contractors and their employees, respond to news media inquiries.    Morrison-Knudsen, the bridge contractor, also declined comment.    SURVIVOR'S STORY    "My only thought was to get out" after bridge collapsed on his vehicle, driver  says. Page 8

headline:   U.S. TO TAKE LEAD IN 'WHISTLE-BLOWER' SUIT AGAINST LITTON   
text:   The Justice Department disclosed Wednesday that it will take over prosecution  of a private "whistle-blower" lawsuit accusing a Litton Industries subsidiary  of overcharging the government by at least $25 million for computer work on  hundreds of defense contracts.    The lawsuit, ordered unsealed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Matthew M. Byrne  Jr. in Los Angeles, accuses the company's Woodland Hills computer division of  boosting charges to the government for computer time so it could charge  commercial customers less.    Lawyers representing the former Litton data systems analyst who initially filed  the suit, James Carton of Moorpark, said the suit could make the company liable  for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.    Justice Department lawyers declined to comment on the case, but in court papers  unsealed Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said the  government has completed its investigation of Carton's allegations and has  elected to "assume primary responsibility for prosecuting the action."    Litton, one of the nation's leading suppliers of defense electronics equipment,  said there is no truth to any of the allegations and said the company had in  fact saved the government money by sharing computer time with commercial  customers.      Claims Money Saved    "We're aware of the general allegations being made, and what we would like to  say is that in fact the exact opposite is true," said company spokesman John  Thom. "There's been no overcharging. In fact, there's been substantial  reduction in costs for the data processing services that division charges.  We've been saving American taxpayers literally millions of dollars by selling  to commercial customers."    Under the federal False Claims Act, private citizens like Carton who believe  they have evidence of wrongdoing against the government are allowed to file  lawsuits that are kept under seal until the government investigates the  allegations. If the government decides there is merit to the case, it can elect  to take over the lawsuit and share a portion of any damages collected with the  original "whistle-blower."    "It's precisely the kind of case that the False Claims Act was designed to  unearth," said John Phillips, one of the lawyers representing Carton. "No  government auditor would have turned this up, regardless of how careful and  thorough they were."    The lawsuit alleges that Litton, apparently in an attempt to attract more  commercial computer customers, did not charge commercial clients for using  Litton's computer memory banks beyond a certain "cap" level.      Government Clients    There were no such "caps" for government contract clients, however, and the  government has ended up paying the excess overhead for commercial customers,  the suit alleges.    Carton, 46, said in an interview that he discovered the problem when he was  asked as technical director of the Woodland Hills division to do a  profitability study of the company's computer clients.    Carton said he discovered within a few days that there was no way to determine  how much profit Litton derived from each customer because the accounting system  between government and commercial clients was so intertwined. "I was deep into  the bowels of the software that runs the machine, and I was apparently touching  some nerves," he said.    Carton said he confronted his superiors with his findings -- that the  government was clearly being overcharged for computer services -- but got no  response.    Phillips said he believes that Litton officials deliberately designed the  accounting system to pass excess costs to the government. "It was conscious, it  was deliberate, it was planned, and they were reaping the benefits of it all  along," he said.      Lawsuit Initiated    Carton filed the lawsuit about a year after he left the company on friendly  terms in 1987. But he continued to work as a consultant for Litton and believes  that the company has continued to mischarge the government.    Litton officials declined to discuss details of the company's accounting  system, and also declined to say what proportion of the company's computer  customers are commercial clients.    But Thom did say that sharing computer time between government and private  customers allowed for economies of scale that were passed off in the form of  savings to the government.    "We're stunned by the fact that we would get sued over such a matter, when  we're saving the government money," he said.

headline:   FIRST GOVERNOR TO VISIT;    DEUKMEJIAN GETS WARM WELCOME IN KOREATOWN   
text:   Sounding more like a candidate than a lame-duck politician, Gov. George  Deukmejian used his first official visit to Koreatown Wednesday to tout his  efforts to reduce crime, aid small business and improve trade with Pacific Rim  nations.    In a pointed reference to his predecessor, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.,  Deukmejian took credit for appointing "over 700 common-sense judges" during his  tenure in office and signing new laws strengthening criminal penalties.  Deukmejian has repeatedly criticized Brown in the past for his judicial  appointments, especially that of former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird.      First Visit    The 200 business leaders, who paid $20 apiece to attend the luncheon with the  governor, greeted Deukmejian with a standing ovation but seemed more interested  in his presence than the 20-minute speech he gave.    "This is really the first time that a governor has visited Koreatown," said  Edward R. Borcherdt, chairman of the Los Angeles Pusan Sister City Committee.  "They're very excited about it, because it is a recognition of the importance  of the Korean-American community in this city and this state."      Economic Strength    Yoon Hee Kim, president of the Korean American Coalition, said the governor's  visit symbolized the emerging political and economic strength of the  Korean-American community, whose population has exploded in the last two  decades.    An estimated 350,000 to 500,000 Korean-Americans now reside in Southern  California, with Los Angeles being home for the largest Korean population  outside Asia.    Kim said only in the last six years have Korean-Americans really begun to look  at themselves as a community and to register to vote in any numbers. Even so,  their voting strength -- she estimates it at 25,000 -- is still relatively  small. Kim said their voting patterns appear to be evenly divided between  Democrats and Republicans.      'Real Commitment'    "This is a community whose growth is absolutely phenomenal," she said. "Now  it's time that the Korean community work with outsiders, but at the same time,  we need a real commitment from mainstream politicians. The first and critical  thing for us is to bring them down to see the community."    Deukmejian declined an invitation to tour Koreatown, citing other commitments  in his schedule, but Craig Coleman, executive director of the Korea Society,  said he had agreed to lend his name to efforts to promote cultural and  educational exchanges between Korea and the United States.

headline:   COLLECTION AGENCY WILL SHUT DOWN ITS OPERATION   
text:   North America Credit Assn., one of the oldest and largest credit collection  agencies in Southern California, notified clients Wednesday that it will cease  operating April 30.    However, delinquent debtors will not be let off the hook. Companies that employ  collection agencies generally have several firms doing collection work for  them, and observers said competitors will quickly pick up the business.    An unknown number of employees will be laid off by the Pasadena company, which  has annually collected about $500,000 in delinquent credit payments on behalf  of companies such as GTE California, the Broadway department store chain and  First Interstate Bank.      200 Employees    Until about three weeks ago, the company reportedly had about 200 employees,  but owner Alexander Kreger told state authorities then that he was in the  process of reducing that number "significantly." A woman who answered the phone  at the company late Wednesday said the firm had no comment to make.    Alonzo D. Hall, chief of the Bureau of Collections and Investigative Services,  a unit of the State Department of Consumer Affairs that licenses the state's  678 collection agencies, said bureau auditors will begin examining the  company's books Monday. Hall said he had no idea what prompted the planned  shutdown.    For a time, he said, "we will take over the client accounts" to ensure that any  money already collected on behalf of clients is turned over to them.      55-Year-Old Agency    NACA, as the nearly 55-year-old agency is known, notified the bureau in  Wednesday's mail of its intention to close. Hall said he talked with Kreger  three weeks ago after receiving an anonymous tip that NACA was having financial  difficulties. Hall said Kreger at that time denied any financial woes but  acknowledged that he was reducing his staff.    At GTE California in Thousand Oaks, spokeswoman Ilona Smith acknowledged that  the company had been notified of NACA's decision to close but said the action  would have little effect on the phone company. "We have seven agencies that we  use, plus we do some of our own in-house collections before we ever go to an  agency," she said.    Whereas the closing is not expected to affect consumers, competitors  immediately set out to try to lure NACA's clients.    "That's dead meat out there now, and they will be picking at the bones," Hall  said. For the collection industry, he added, "it is really a big deal."

headline:   IT'S CHRISTMAS IN MARCH FOR GLENDALE'S RESIDENT SANTA   
text:   The Glendale city attorney who argued the case thought the ruling was nothing  short of vindication. So did his opponent, Santa Claus.    The two were squared off over a consent decree that Glendale's self-styled  Santa, Robert George, who keeps his home decorated for the holidays all year,  had signed in November, 1987. In it, George gave up, among other things, his  right to have visitors come to his home, except "bona fide" friends and  deliverymen. Later, on the advice of the American Civil Liberties Union, George  reneged on the clause, which the city said was designed to keep sightseeing  crowds under control.    On Monday, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals chided the city for what it  viewed as an "Orwellian" attempt to abridge a citizen's most fundamental rights  -- those of free speech and association.    But the court did not side with George entirely, noted Senior Assistant City  Atty. Scott Howard.    Nothing in the Constitution, the judges ruled, precludes a city from limiting  the number of "Styrofoam bells, baubles, artificial animals, statuaries, or any  other temporary or permanent Christmas-type ornaments . . . lights or lighting"  a resident can put up, or when.    Thus the Court of Appeals let stand George's agreement not to put up any more  decorations than he had on Oct. 1, 1987, and to turn the remaining ones on only  during the Christmas season.    "If there were to be any gripes at all about the decision, or any feelings of  disappointment, it is that the court allowed him to back out of an agreement,"  Howard said.    Santa, on the other hand, seemed a touch more ebullient.    "I beat the city," George said. "Santa Claus beat the city. They said I  couldn't do it, but I did."    The court was clearly piqued at the city's attempt to "ban members of the  public from entering or remaining on appellant's property" and to allow "no  more than two visits a month by terminally ill children," as the consent degree  called for.    The city argued that both parties understood that those words referred to the  large crowds of sightseers at George's home.    "This is not what the order says, nor can the First Amendment rights be the  subject of unwritten and, therefore, unenforceable understandings," the court  said.    Neither side, at this point, plans an appeal. But that doesn't mean the case is  closed.    George said he plans a victory party. He also intends to put back up the lights  he took down after the city began enforcement against year-round Christmas at  his rented home on Alameda Avenue.    Howard says he will be watching for illegal lights.

headline:   PROJECT ACTIVIST ALARMED BY HOUSING AUTHORITY REBUKE   
text:   Last month, Margarito Gutierrez went door to door in the Estrada Courts public  housing project, collecting money from his neighbors so he could attend a  housing conference in Washington. One tenant gave four pennies. Another kicked  in two quarters. In all, Gutierrez raised $627.    Gutierrez, a member of the Housing Authority Residents Advisory Committee,  returned from the conference three weeks ago with a message for his fellow  tenants: Beware that the Housing Authority could sell Estrada Courts in East  Los Angeles to a private developer just as it plans to do with the dilapidated  Jordan Downs public housing project in Watts.    On Tuesday, according to Gutierrez, Housing Authority officials summoned him to  the manager's office at Estrada Courts to rebuke him for going to Washington  and for appearing on two Spanish-language television stations in Los Angeles to  criticize the proposal to sell Jordan Downs. A housing official defended the  visit to Gutierrez, claiming the tenant needlessly frightened other project  dwellers.    Gutierrez, 44, a longtime resident of Estrada Courts, said Wednesday that he  was grilled during a 20-minute meeting with Leonard Karter, the agency's group  operations manager for Eastside projects, and Georgina Garcia, the manager of  Estrada Courts. Karter posed a series of questions on the trip to Washington  and on his television appearances, Gutierrez said.    "He started to interrogate me. 'What did I say in Washington? Who gave me  permission to talk to television? Why was I making people afraid?' " Gutierrez,  who speaks little English, said in Spanish.    Karter said Wednesday the thrust of the meeting was to assure Gutierrez that  Estrada Courts was not for sale. Karter denied that he inquired about the  Washington trip, but acknowledged asking about the television appearances,  including questions about Gutierrez's motivation and who initiated the  interview.    "We discussed the free speech thing," Karter said of the Tuesday meeting.  "Anybody can say what they wish but at the same time, he had a responsibility  not to alarm tenants."    The meeting occurred Tuesday afternoon -- the same day that Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky assailed the Housing Authority and its executive director, Leila  Gonzalez-Correa, for proposing a ban on public comment by the agency's  employees. Gonzalez-Correa has introduced a policy that would prevent employees  from writing or speaking to housing commissioners, City Council members,  government workers and reporters without the executive director's permission.    Yaroslavsky introduced a motion Wednesday recommending that the Housing  Authority Board of Commissioners reject the proposed policy and that  Gonzalez-Correa be required to appear before the City Council. The motion was  scheduled to be heard next week.    Gutierrez reported the meeting with Karter to David Etezadi, a Legal Aid  Foundation attorney who represents East Los Angeles tenants. Etezadi said he  was "outraged" by the incident and considers the actions by housing officials  "a violation of Gutierrez's rights." Etezadi pointed out that, a year ago, the  Housing Authority sent a police officer to question a tenant who had signed a  petition calling for Gonzalez-Correa's resignation.    "I think it is an intimidation tactic," Etezadi said. "Clearly, they are trying  to extend the gag order to residents."    Etezadi said Gutierrez called him Tuesday "very much upset" that he had been  reprimanded by the Housing Authority.    "Mr. Gutierrez has been working real closely with residents throughout the city  to oppose the sale of Jordan Downs," Etezadi said. "His fear as a tenant  representative stems back to a year ago when the executive director guaranteed  that the Housing Authority would never sell a development. He, as well as other  residents, feel incredibly betrayed. He has been quite active since the  announcement of the sale warning people that the same thing could happen in  their own developments."    On Wednesday, Gonzalez-Correa issued a bulletin advising tenants that the  Housing Authority had no plans to sell Estrada Courts, housing officials said.    Gutierrez, a factory worker who has been on welfare since he was laid off two  years ago, lives in a clean, well-kept five-bedroom apartment in Estrada Courts  with his wife and six children. A captain of his Neighborhood Watch program,  Gutierrez was elected two years ago by tenants at Estrada Courts as their  representative on the residents advisory committee. Since then, he has been a  relentless activist in organizing tenants at Estrada Courts to keep their  project clean and crime-free.    In news interviews that aired over the last week on television stations KMEX  Channel 34 and KVEA Channel 52, Gutierrez said he feared that Estrada Courts  may be put up for sale because tenants have spotted groups of Chinese investors  walking through the project on weekend mornings.    Gutierrez said he attended the National Convention of Urban Homesteading and  Resident Management conference in early March because he wanted to learn how  residents became owners and managers of public housing projects in Washington  and other cities. He hopes to begin a process this year for residents to take  over Estrada Courts.

headline:   ENCINITAS GENERAL PLAN STRICTLY LIMITS GROWTH   
text:   Culminating nearly two years of debate and scores of hearings, the Encinitas  City Council on Wednesday adopted the fledgling municipality's first general  plan, an ambitious blueprint for the future that includes strict limits on  growth.    The council approved the plan on a 4-1 vote, with Councilwoman Gail Hano  dissenting because of her opposition to the slow-growth provisions of the  document.    Mayor Anne Omsted said adoption of the plan marks "a milestone in city  history," but echoed Hano's concerns about the tough controls on growth.      200 Units Annually    Omsted expressed hope after the meeting that the council could work together in  the coming months to hammer out less restrictive slow-growth measures  acceptable to all factions in the city, which incorporated in 1986 on a wave of  anti-development sentiment.    Aside from dramatically reducing projected housing densities from the days of  county rule, the new general plan includes a cap on housing construction of  about 200 units annually and requires voter approval for significant changes in  land use or for density increases.    Taken in total, the density reductions would allow a population of 65,000 at  buildout, contrasted with an eventual population of 75,000 under the old county  land-use plans.    City officials say adoption of the plan represents a significant symbolic step  for Encinitas, the final act in throwing off the yoke of county rule.    "I almost feel choked up thinking of all the things we requested for so many  years, all of them finally being put into one general plan," Councilwoman  Marjorie Gaines said before the meeting.    Acting as a sort of municipal constitution, the plan embodies a wide range of  rules and standards for development, among them tighter grading restrictions,  tougher landscaping requirements, strict design reviews and regulations to  better protect environmentally sensitive areas.      Effort for Migrants    Although city officials were bullish on the new general plan, critics remained  to the end. In particular, advocates of more low-income housing for migrant  workers mounted a last-ditch effort to alter the plan.    During the past year, migrants camping out in the hills around Encinitas have  come under increasing pressure from local authorities eager to see them  uprooted.    Advocates for the immigrants argue that the city's new plan is a barrier to the  construction of affordable housing for those displaced from their simple homes  of scrap lumber and plastic sheeting in the squalid migrant encampments.    Officials with California Rural Legal Assistance, a group that aids the  impoverished migrants, wrote letters to the city and state in an effort to  argue their case.    "This plan is stunningly exclusionary," Claudia Smith, regional counsel for  California Rural Legal Assistance, said in an interview before the meeting. "It  makes Newport Beach look good. Encinitas officials don't want poor immigrant  workers in any way, shape or form, and this general plan is the proof in the  pudding."    Smith protested an effort by the city to get a one-year extension on Friday's  deadline for adopting the general plan. Under state law, cities have 30 months  after incorporation to approve a general plan, but Encinitas is seeking to  extend its deadline until next year to immunize its land-use plan from legal  challenges while authorities tinker with the document.      Considered Suing    Smith characterized the city's request as "a transparent attempt to foil  litigation for a year." Her group has considered suing the city because of  concerns about the plan's effect on low-income housing.    If the state grants the one-year extension, Smith said, the city should be  allowed to approve construction of large projects consisting of 10 or more  units only if 25% of the homes are set aside as affordable housing.    City Manager Warren Shafer agreed that the city wants the time extension as a  safeguard against litigation.    But he said officials are wary of legal challenges simply because the general  plan is still scheduled for review by the state Coastal Commission, which could  order changes in the document. Moreover, city planners will continue to work on  zoning provisions of the plan during the coming year. A lawsuit or two would  only complicate either process, Shafer said.    Although a suit over the migrant issue could loom, city officials contend that  their greatest concern is a legal challenge by developers.    "Basically, we're just trying to avoid unnecessary litigation and expense,"  Shafer said, noting that officials hope to have the city's plan before the  Coastal Commission for review in the next few months.

headline:   SCHOOLS AWAIT WORD ON TEST SCORE MISTAKES   
text:   Schools in San Diego County and throughout California will find out later this  week that their scores on a key statewide test of writing skills for  eighth-graders were computed erroneously for the spring of 1987, the first year  that the test was given.    The schools only last week learned their scores for the second year of the  writing test, given in the spring of 1988, and received comparisons between the  two years, which will now have to be refigured by state California Assessment  Program testing officials.    For the San Diego Unified School District, the revised scores will offer little  solace, as the results will still show that their students fall behind their  peers in other county districts and across the state in their ability to  organize their thoughts and write coherent essays on an assigned topic in a  45-minute test.    Some of San Diego's 22 junior highs and middle schools will find that they did  better in 1988 than in 1987, and others will learn they did not do as well as  they thought. But the trend in San Diego still points to shortcomings with the  district's writing programs, despite the increased emphasis on teaching writing  during the past two years.      Designed by UCSD Professor    "No one is going to applaud, even with the (revised) scores," Robert Raines, a  testing evaluator for the San Diego district, said Wednesday. "When all is said  and done, the bad news is still going to be that the district is below the  state on writing achievement, and that is not good enough for us."    The CAP writing test, designed by UC San Diego literature and writing professor  Charles Cooper, is the state's first to directly assess student writing ability  rather than evaluate it on the basis of responses to multiple-choice questions  on standardized tests.    Students are asked to write an original essay on topics in one of six areas of  writing -- including autobiography, evaluation and problem-solving -- with the  grading done by selected teachers from around the state.    Under CAP procedures, scores for individual students are not collected. Rather,  data is compiled for individual schools and for school districts to measure the  state's educational pulse each year and see whether state goals are being met  by educators.    The mistake happened because the consultants failed to take into consideration  the number of students at each school who took the test, state CAP official Pat  McCabe said.      Performances Dropped    No one noticed the discrepancy until scores for the spring 1988 test --  correctly calculated -- were received during the past couple of weeks, which  showed that most San Diego city schools dropped in performance between 1987 and  1988 -- or stayed about the same -- despite increased attention to writing in  the classroom.    Several principals called Raines to ask how their scores could have dropped, in  some cases quite dramatically.    One example of what has happened is at Memorial Junior High School. It had been  told there was a difference of only 1 point between its 1987 and 1988 scores.  This was a disappointment because the school is now a special magnet writing  academy in an effort to boost performance among its overwhelmingly Latino  student body and to attract Caucasian students.    Raines said that Memorial's revised 1987 score will now drop significantly,  meaning that its 1988 score will reflect considerable improvement.    But, despite expected comparison gains at some schools, most schools and the  district will report 1988 scores below the state average.    District administrators do not yet fully understand why their schools' writing  performance lags behind countywide and state averages. The district has  sponsored workshops for teachers to learn new techniques, participated in a  countywide writing project for secondary schools, and in general stressed the  need for more writing in all major academic areas.    UCSD's Cooper said questions asked of students taking the CAP tests show that,  no matter the socioeconomic base of a school, "where the emphasis is on writing  in all areas of teaching and where every teacher takes an interest in writing,  there are big gains.      'Strong Leadership'    "The research also supports the need to practice a lot of different kinds of  writings, that gains in literacy are connected to specific uses and that  teachers need to be encouraged to teach writing more carefully.    "In addition, a principal has to show strong leadership in encouraging  teachers."    At one of the district's bright spots -- Mann Middle School in East San Diego  -- its 1988 score is well above district and state averages, and its 1987 score  will probably be revised downward, meaning the school will be one of the few in  the district to make significant gains.    "It results from a concentrated effort spearheaded by our teachers," Mann  Principal Maruta Gardner said. "We devised a plan where each department, such  as math, took upon itself to emphasize two particular types of writing and we  did that throughout the year, not just during the testing period."    Almost a quarter of Mann's students are not yet proficient in English, and  about a quarter more, although fluent, are not native English speakers, making  the school's performance all the more remarkable.    "With our population, we knew we had to work hard at this, and not just tell  the kids that they should get a good night's sleep before the test and to eat  well. We decided last year that we needed to have a plan," Gardner said.    At Correia Junior High in Point Loma, the revised scores will mean less of a  drop between 1987 and 1988 than Principal Mike Lorch thought, although there  will still be a drop.    "It's very disappointing . . . and basically, instead of coming up with  explanations to gloss over and mitigate, we basically know that we are not  writing enough and not writing enough in a lot of areas. That's something I  want to sit down with my teachers and support committees and figure out why.
