headline:    Martinazzoli Rebukes De Mita's Criticism 
text:  Language:   Italian   Article Type:BFN     [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Martinazzoli Versus De Mita:   `His Remarks Are Merely Insults'"]    [Text] Rome -- It was a sharp slap in the face: Nobody  likes to hear themselves being called "nonexistent," accused of  submissiveness to an "idiot" -- even if that idiot's name is  [Pact for Italy leader] Mariotto Segni. [Italian Popular Party,  PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli said nothing. Nothing to  journalists, nothing to his aides, and nothing even to those  working with him to draw up lists of candidates. It must have  been difficult not to comment even to his closest associates on  the bomb dropped by De Mita in the very heart of what used to be  the DC [Christian Democratic Party] left. To ignore the  announcement that, amid so many problems, the "great outcast" is  planning to wage war, within a PPI that he can see sliding to  the right, into the arms of [Northern League leader] Bossi and  [Forza Italian leader] Berlusconi. But in the evening  Martinazzoli's rage exploded: "Let him by all means occupy an  opposition stance within the party; that is his right. But,"  Martinazzoli said, "I consider some of his remarks entirely  unjust. They are insults, rather than arguments. And I greatly  regret the fact."    The secretary was furious, hurt, and worried. This is  because he is fully aware that De Mita is not alone in thinking  those things, as he witnesses the disappearance or the collapse,  one by one, of the candidates, representing all groups, of the  old left -- De Mita, Bodrato, Tina Anselmi, Granelli, Mancino,  and Mattarella. Moreover, in the shadow of the axis with Segni,  there is again a growing fear that the "ideologue," Rocco  Buttiglione, could realize the dream of a DC "controlled by  Communion and Liberation."    In fact the PPI [Italian Popular Party] leadership realized  at once that the secretary had read De Mita's interview  carefully. They inferred it from Martinazzoli's response to the  reckless person who asked him to reveal his plans for the coming  days: "But we do not even know what the world will be like next  week." The questions subsided, but his silence was not enough  to quell his anger. And when he drove off from his home at 1600  Martinazzoli looked extremely grim. This, even though he was on  his way to meet not with "the Irpinia progressive ethnic group"  (as PPI leaders call De Mita's supporters) but with the  officials of CIDA, the Business Managers' Federation.    He arrived dressed in blue, on edge, smoking a cigarette,  with a look that said: "Don't come near me or I'll kill you."  But television Channel 1 journalist Mimmo Sacco -- who has  devoured several DC secretaries -- was brave enough to approach  him. He knew exactly where he was driving, but he took an  oblique approach, asking whether there are still any "problems"  with Segni. His prudence did not spare him an attack: "You must  stop it. It is you who have fabricated these ruptures and  disputes. I have had enough of it." Sacco did not give up, and  craftily talked about Occhetto, about strong men, even  succeeding in making the secretary smile. He took advantage of  this to ask his key question: What about De Mita? This time  Martinazzoli did not even answer: He rolled his eyes, shook his  head, spluttered, "What, again?" and made off, turning his back  on Sacco.    At 1900 he returned to PPI headquarters. Rosy Bindi had just  left. It is well known that she does not like the right. So,  did she like what De Mita had to say? "His interview confirms  that he has tremendous political acumen," she replied with  conviction. So is he correct? Are the PPI's lists really in  danger of providing a stepping stone to a life to the right of  Segni? "We are indeed working to ensure that this does not  happen."    That is not exactly the official line. This, though  Martinazzoli did make hints at his meeting with CIDA officials:  He stepped up his attack on a Right that he swore he did not  want to ally with, a right that "if it continues this way  threatens to be victorious," a Right that "is anything but what  the country needs, and that will lead Italy back to the years of  autarchy" -- a Right that has "a real leader who is neither  [Northern League leader] Bossi nor [Italian Social Movement]  leader Fini" and within which the League "no longer represents a  break but has become an amalgamating force."    This is consistent, according to his associates; "it is what  he has always thought; he does not need to reply to De Mita."  They too are angry with De Mita who is "obsessed with being at  the center of the world"; "who is now attacking CAF [Craxi,  Andreotti, Forlani], though in 1989 he curbed Martinazzoli,  arguing the `realism' of the agreement with Forlani"; who "would  be right if it were true--which it is not--that he was left off  the electoral list without anyone having asked him to make such  a generous gesture..." Silvia Costa also defended the  secretary: "What? If we have always claimed that parliamentary  representation is a service, why should someone get angry over  their seat? De Mita is wrong: Unfortunately, it was the way in  which he was asked not to run that turned his personal candidacy  into a political one."    But these remarks came from the first floor, contrasting  with  the sepulchral silence that reigned on the second floor -- in  the inner sanctum, until Maria Eletta Martini emerged. So what  about De Mita? she did not reply, drew a sigh, and shrugged.  Are you turning to the right? She was about to shrug again,  then stopped herself and blurted: "Ciriaco is expressing  well-founded anxieties, with which I fully agree. But I  interpret them as anxieties, whereas he talks about them as  faits accomplis. In fact, after all, the elections have not yet  taken place. As you know, we are in a difficult situation. We  have loyally supported what was certainly not a progressive  government and have had to form handicapped alliances." And  were they fair with De Mita over his candidacy? This time the  old De Mita supporter became heated: "On this point De Mita is  entirely in the right. We treated him like dirt, like some kid  who should stand aside. I have said so, too." A few feet away,  Martinazzoli's press officer blanched. But by this point she  was unstoppable. And when someone asked her whether she trusts  Segni she looked at him as though he were crazy: "No, for  goodness' sake." These are difficult times for Martinazzoli.

headline:    Occhetto Says Craxi's Accusations To Support Berlusconi 
text:  Language:   Italian   Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the   Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, and Deputy Secretary Massimo  D'Alema by Roberto Roscani; place and date not given:  "Occhetto: `Craxi's Slander'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Roscani] You refer to the  poisoned fruits of Craxism. Do you have the names?    [Occhetto] I have said this many times and I will repeat it:  Berlusconism is the product of Craxism. Anyone writing about  the history of Italy would link these two phenomena. On the  other hand, just two or three years ago even a child would have  answered Berlusconi if asked which businessman was linked to  Craxi. Now it seems to be blasphemy but we know how important  historical memories are.    [Roscani] You have said that the word of a malefactor has  become the yardstick of justice. This means that the PDS  intends changing all legislation that favors those who confess,  because this is what has happened to date in Italy.    [Occhetto] You have distorted my statement in saying this: I  spoke about the word of a malefactor becoming a yardstick of  false justice.    [D'Alema] And then we are not aware of the fact the Craxi is  a confessor, if anything, he is a recidivist. If we want to  talk seriously about emergency legislation, however, let us do  so, but it has nothing to do with all this.    [Roscani] Honorable Occhetto, in these days there has also  been the [PDS official] Morandina case and the judicial notices  of investigation to the DC [Christian Democratic party] heads in  the Veneto region. What is your opinion about this?    [Occhetto] I learned about the Morandina case from the  press.  He made statements saying that these accounts belonged to him.  This situation does not convince me and I hope that the  judicial authorities will help us understand what has happened.  We would be extremely severe with anyone who may have abused  the name of the PDS for its own illicit activities.    [Roscani] This morning the front page of all the newspapers  read: D'Alema under investigation. Do you mean that all the  press misunderstood?    [Occhetto] The current state of the situation is this: Craxi  accused Occhetto, D'Alema, Stefanini, and others. D'Alema went  to lodge a counteraccusation. As a result D'Alema was reported  as being under investigation. I said that it could be a case,  which would then hold true for everybody, of the automatic  application of Article 835 of the Code on Proceedings which has  a purely technical significance and not the political and  judicial significance attributed in some newspaper headlines.  Accused by Craxi: This is our situation today.    [D'Alema] Neither you nor I can know if a name is included  in  the register of those under investigation. Nobody can know, nor  must they know. A person is under investigation if he receives a  judicial notice to that effect. I have received none.    [Roscani] The newspapers have been going on with these  rumors  for two years now.    [D'Alema] I am not able to confirm or deny this for the  simple reason that I do not know. None of us can know.    [Occhetto] If the public prosecutor's office does its work  properly your case and our case are identical: that of people  who do not know. Because if we were to know, this would mean  that one aspect of that institution has been violated. In fact,  that one aspect is secrecy.    [Roscani] Do you think that Craxi's move is a means of  supporting Berlusconi's electoral campaign?    [D'Alema] Occhetto has been very clear. Objectively it is,  even though this does not mean that there was an agreement or a  plot.

headline:    Berlusconi on D'Alema Investigation, Judiciary 
text:  Language:   Italian   Article Type:BFN     [Unattributed report: "Berlusconi to D'Alema: `I Am Sorry,   Best Wishes'"]    [Text] Rome -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi  about [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Deputy Secretary]  Massimo D'Alema. "I am sorry to hear this news. I am very  deeply sorry. I really don't approve of people who rejoice when  a political opponent gets into such a situation." Silvio  Berlusconi was talking during a long interview on GR-1 radio.  "I prefer to think positively," the Forza Italia leader said,  "if there has to be political competition, let it be honest  competition, in which everyone confronts each other on the basis  of party programs. I say this very sincerely, I do not like to  see these things happen." Berlusconi after expressing the wish  that the election campaign "become unpoisoned," dwelt on the  subject of the judiciary. "I'd like to think that one does not  find in the judiciary the strong politicization which many  believe to be there, and there are no judges and magistrates who  act in the service not only of the law, but in the service of an  ideology or even a political faction." "I believe that judges  and magistrates," Berlusconi added, "should feel that it is part  of their function to be above parties. If a judge becomes  politically biased, I believe that he is no longer a judge. My  wish is that they are conscious of the responsibility of their  function, and that all of them, in the north, in the south, even  if they have sympathies to the right, the left or the center,  realize that this is what is important."

headline:    League Criticizes Scalfaro's Approach Toward PDS 
text:  Language:   Italian   Article Type:BFN     [Unattributed report: "Scalfaro Overly Solicitous Toward   Occhetto"]    [Text] Milan -- For the Northern League, the reactions to  the "judicial matters involving the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left]" last Wednesday [16 February] are "serious and alarming."  In particular, we read in a release from the League's press  office that the "worrying" approach taken by President of the  Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro toward PDS Secretary Achille  Occhetto is open to criticism. "The Northern League," we read  in the communique, considers as unacceptable the statements made  by PDS member of parliament Correnti, for whom "justice is too  serious a matter to be left in the hands of the judiciary," and  is even more concerned at the intervention of the head of state  who, after convening the chairmen of the lower house and the  Senate to the Quirinale [president's palace], felt obliged to  reassure Occhetto, explaining to him that he himself was acting  as guarantor of a correct and calm outcome of the election  campaign, with the responsible assistance of all the organs of  state, the judiciary included, evidently."    The memo also includes several statements by Roberto Ronchi,  in charge of the political secretariat, who wonders "why  Scalfaro did not show a similar concern when, during the past  electoral campaigns, other political forces were involved."  "The League genuinely hopes," Ronchi wrote, "that this  election, which is so important for the future of our country,  will not be disturbed by the final thrashings of a style of  politics now in its death throws."

headline:    Major, Reynolds on Ulster Peace Moves 
text:  Language:   English   Article Type:BFN     [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION]     [Text] Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart  Albert Reynolds pledged today to continue the search for peace  and political progress in Northern Ireland.    In 75 minutes of talks in Downing Street -- the first since  they signed their historic Ulster peace declaration two months  ago -- they took stock of developments on their joint initiative  to end the spiral of violence.    Hours before their discussions began they were given a grim  reminder of the continuing terrorism.    A series of firebomb attacks in seven London stores bore all  the hallmarks of the Provisonal IRA, said Scotland Yard.    As they left Downing Street, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds united  in condemning the incidents and recent terrorist attacks in  Northern Ireland    Mr Major said: "Our response to that is entirely identical.  There is absolutely no justification for those firebombs  overnight any more than there is justification for the killing  of a community police officer in Belfast last week or the other  atrocities that have taken place in Northern Ireland."    The prime ministers agreed to initiate a new round of  negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland with or without a  response from the IRA and their Sinn Fein allies to the December  15 peace declaration.    Mr Reynolds said officials from the two governments would  agree later today on a date for a meeting of their liaison  committee to advance the next stage of the talks process.    Mr Major insisted: "There is a route now open for Sinn Fein  to join the constitutional process -- they know what they have  to do. All they have to do is give up violence and then they  will have a proper route to express their views  constitutionally."    Mr Reynolds again stressed his view that the road to peace  was going to be a long one and that there would be difficulties  along the way.    "We knew there would always be people on both sides on the  paramilitaries who would be trying to stop our best efforts.    "But regardless of this violence and destruction that takes  place we will continue along that difficult road, recognising  that people will be trying to frustrate our efforts but that  they will not succeed."    Today's meeting went ahead before the two prime ministers  join the crowd at Twickenham for the Ireland-England rugby  international. Mr Major referred to the match as he and Mr  Reynolds began a brief news conference outside 10 Downing Street  by saying he had brought along his second row.    "We are wholly united in our approach to try to find a  solution to the problems of Northern Ireland," he added.    "We regard our joint declaration as a foundation stone for  the future approach of the two governments. We are committed to  it and its lasting value. We see it as a balanced statement of  lasting principles, and it is our view that its value has  already been clearly shown in the way it has been received both  in Ireland and internationally."    Mr Major said it was impossible for either he or Mr Reynolds  to say whether the IRA would give up its campaign of violence in  the near future.    "What we are utterly agreed about is that there is no  justification for the continuation of violence by the  Provisionals or by anybody else. What must be fully understood  is that we are not waiting for the Provisionals or anybody else.    "We have taken further steps in the talks process and we  have  this morning reaffirmed our joint commitment to that process.  No one should be able to veto progress on the talks. We have  made clear what Sinn Fein needs to do to join the process.    "They are free to come in or they are free to stay out -- if  that is what they choose. But what they can't do is hold up our  determination to continue with the talks process and endeavour  to find a solution."    The two premiers agreed to maintain the current high level  of  cooperation on security and do all they could to oppose  terrorism.    Mr Major said he believed improved security cooperation was  of immense help in recent years, and that was going to continue.    "The intention that we both have is peace. We'd like it soon  but however long it takes our determination is to continue a  search for that peace."

headline:    London Shops Firebombed; Reynolds Previews Talks 
text:  Language:   English   Article Type:BFN     [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION]     [Text] IRA violence will not deter Irish prime minister  Albert Reynolds' belief in the two-month-old Anglo-Irish  Northern Ireland peace declaration, he insisted today.    As terrorist experts investigated the cause of the fires  which broke out at seven stores in central London this morning,  Mr Reynolds again stressed there was still no deadline for an  IRA response to December's joint initiative.    The Dublin premier was speaking before new talks at Downing  Street with John Major on prospects for ending the terrorism --  against a background of the Oxford Street firebombings at the  end of last month and renewed IRA violence earlier this week.    The new IRA attacks -- including the first murder this year  -- were being seen as a thumbs-down for the talks process.    But Mr Reynolds said: "If somebody thinks I'll just give up  because we have another unfortunate killing or attacks, they  should know it is not going to stop me.    "We are on a mission of peace and will continue with it  until  we are absolutely satisfied there is no hope left. That is the  way I feel at the moment -- and I am going to continue on that  road."    Mr Reynolds arrived in London last night with Deputy Premier  and Foreign Minister Dick Spring for their first meeting with Mr  Major and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew since  the December 15 signing of the Ulster declaration.    Early indications were that this morning's store attacks  were  carried out by the IRA. The outbreaks were caused by incendiary  devices which bore "all the hallmarks of the Provisional IRA",  said Scotland Yard.    But the Irish team made clear they were more determined than  ever to keep alive the prospects for peace.    As Mr Reynolds consulted officials before heading for  Downing  Street, he agreed the renewed terrorism -- demonstrated by both  the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast this week -- was  "disappointing".    He asserted, however: "I am still very hopeful of the  chances  for peace. There has been considerable progress already as I  see it. I have said from the very start that I did not believe  there would be a quick decision on the part of the republican  movement.    "Their decision is of historic proportions, and it will  inevitably take time. There is an intense debate going on in  Ireland north and south among the republicans."    Mr Reynolds said he thought there was considerable support  from members of the IRA and Sinn Fein for the peace declaration  in the run-up to their annual conference in Dublin next weekend.    "I have no intention of setting a deadline. That is not the  way we are going to get a result at the end of the day," he  added, basing his assessment on contacts he has had with  community leaders on both sides of the Ulster border.    After their talks, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will join the  crowd at the England-Ireland rugby international at Twickenham.    Later, in what sounded like a direct message to Sinn Fein,  Mr  Reynolds said there was sufficient in the explanations and  clarifications of the Downing Street Declaration "to enable the  debate to come to a conclusion".    Considerable progress had been made towards peace since the  publication of the declaration in mid-December, he told BBC  Radio 4's Today programme shortly before his Downing Street  talks.    "I have said from the start I did not believe there would be  any quick decision in this regard. I think the intense debate  that is continuing in the republican movement is what I expected  it to be -- very intense. For them to come to a decision of  historic proportions will inevitably take time."    While he thought there was growing support among  nationalists  for peace "a slim majority would not really be acceptable among  the republican movement.    "Nobody wants a split in that movement again -- the split in  the 1970's brought the last 25 years of violence and we do not  want another 25 years of violence.    "Whatever time it takes to finish that debate and to ensure  a  very large majority of republican supporters would go along with  the peace process -- that is what we want and that is what we  are going to try to achieve."

headline:    Major on `Greatly Improved' Situation in Bosnia 
text:  Language:   English   Article Type:BFN     [By Joe Quinn, PRESS ASSOCIATION]     [Text] Air strikes now appear less likely in war-torn  Bosnia after the handing-in of Serbian big guns -- and the  intervention of the Russians, the prime minister said today.  But speaking in Edinburgh at the start of engagements in  Scotland, he said his optimism was heavily qualified with  caution.    However Mr Major added that the situation in Bosnia had  "greatly improved" in the last 24 hours.    "A large number of heavy weapons have been handed in and  have  been corralled, and are now under UN control" he said.    "That has been happening for two days now. It seems to be  accelerating so it is certainly looking quite good at the  moment."    Mr Major, who had earlier met Scottish business leaders,  said: "I think it is everyone's hope air strikes can be avoided.    "The purpose of threatening air strikes was to stop the  bombardment of Sarajevo and bring the heavy weapons under  control.    "If that can be done by negotiation, and it seems possible  --  we can't yet be certain that it will be, but it seems possible  that it might -- that is clearly very good news."    The prime minister said he was "very pleased" at the  Russian's intervention in the former Yugoslavia.    "The Russians are a member of the permanent five of the  Security Council and have a very considerable influence in that  role, and a very considerable historical influence and  relationship with the Serbs. I think their involvement is bound  to be helpful and I welcome it."    He declined to say if he had persuaded President Yeltsin to  take the decisive step during his visit to Russia earlier this  week, but agreed he discussed Bosnia with him.    "I certainly express the view both privately and publicly  that it was helpful for Russia, the U.S., and the European  Community separately to use their influence and I am delighted  the Russians are doing that."    Mr Major said he had no fears that the United Nations would  be unable to control the Russian forces in Bosnia.    "I would have no concern about that at all," Mr Major said  in  interviews for the BBC and Scottish Television.    "When the Russian forces arrive they will be part and parcel  of the general command structure and I have no doubt at all they  will come under UN control and make a material contribution."    Changes in Russia in recent years have been profound and it  was in everyone's interests to support the Russians, he said.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said his country was  discussing with the UN how many Russian troops would be deployed  around Sarajevo. He would know the figure "in a matter of  hours".

headline:    Leotard on NATO Ultimatum, Subsequent Actions 
text:  Language:   French   Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by   Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux and Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place and  date not given: "Leotard: `No One Should Doubt Our  Determination'"]    [Text] NATO's ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of heavy  weapons from around Sarajevo expires on Sunday [20 February] at  midnight. In this interview, given before the declarations of  Radovan Karadzic, Defense Minister Francois Leotard underlines  France's determination.    [LE FIGARO] How will the international community, NATO, and  the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] evaluate whether or not the  ultimatum has been respected?    [Leotard] The UNPROFOR's opinion will be the decisive  factor.  It will be up to UNPROFOR Commander General Rose, and above him,  General Cot, to decide on the reality of the situation on the  ground.    This is a twofold reality. First, it requires the cessation  of the bombardments of the civilian population in accordance  with the text adopted by NATO on 9 February. Second, it  concerns the withdrawal of heavy weapons.    After the expiry of the ultimatum deadline, we will have to  examine the results on Monday morning. The UNPROFOR will issue  its opinion to the governments of the NATO countries. We  ourselves will be in constant contact with our allies to  evaluate compliance with the withdrawal requirement.    If this evaluation is negative, then the measures planned by  NATO will be put into action. No one should doubt our  determination to apply the decisions that were made in Brussels.    [LE FIGARO] Air strikes could be decided, then, simply by  agreement between the allies? Will it not also require another  meeting of the UN Security Council or the NATO Council?    [Leotard] The decision will be a political one after an  analysis of the facts by General Cot, Mr. Akashi, and Admiral  Boorda, while, of course, keeping the UN secretary general  informed. The UN-NATO procedure is in accordance with what was  decided in August 1993 and translates UN resolution 836.    [LE FIGARO] Has France, independently of the allies, set a  threshold below which it would consider that the ultimatum has  not been respected?    [Leotard] We remain totally free to make up our minds in the  framework of the NATO resolution. We do not have to set a  threshold, that is to say how many weapons, when, how, and  where... If weapons remain, and the Serbs must be aware of this,  then they will be, and I quote from the Brussels communique,  "exposed to air strikes."    The question is not therefore who will decide, because that  decision has already been made. If there is a question then it  could be: Do you want to make one strike on 50 guns or on a few  guns for 50 minutes? That, however, is just a problem of air  strike tactics. Weapons have already been gathered together on  both sides, but we are still nowhere near what is required. If  the ultimatum deadline were to end halfway, I can tell you that  the decision to strike would have been made immediately.    [LE FIGARO] Let us use a more favorable hypothesis, that is  of the ultimatum being respected by Sunday night. What are the  military consequences then?    [Leotard] There will be air and ground patrols. Air patrols  by the aircraft that have for some time been engaged in  reconnaissance missions over Sarajevo; and ground patrols by  UNPROFOR units -- French, Ukrainian, and Egyptian, with the  current reinforcements from Malaysia and Jordan, and perhaps  other units too. We cannot exclude, either, British and French  troops being redeployed.    [LE FIGARO] With fresh units sent from France?    [Leotard] No, using those already in Yugoslavia. The  government does not currently intend sending more soldiers from  France to Sarajevo.    [LE FIGARO] A second hypothesis is that the ultimatum is  not respected and that air strikes are carried out...    [Leotard] Air strikes have been the subject of a constant  process of coordination between the leader of the NATO forces,  Admiral Boorda, the UNPROFOR, and ourselves. As for telling you  where, when, and how they will be implemented and whether it  will be a warning strike or a general strike, do not even hope  that I will tell you. That is military information that cannot  be disclosed.    [LE FIGARO] So nothing is ruled out?    [Leotard] Nothing is ruled out -- no location, no weapon, no  progression in the strikes. That is the very principle of  deterrent.    [LE FIGARO] Certain pieces of Serbian artillery could be  moved rapidly...    [Leotard] All that is known and has been taken into account  by the operations staff. For several months, we have had lists  of targets that are known both to the Air Force and to the  Ground Troops. We will use all the means at our disposal.    [LE FIGARO] Before these air strikes are carried out, have  steps been taken to protect the UN forces in Sarajevo or  elsewhere in Bosnia?    [Leotard] Of course, some very solid precautions have been  taken. However, we know only too well that they cannot cover  every risk. We must be clear: The aggressors would be running  a considerable risk. They must know that.    [LE FIGARO] Could this new measure influence humanitarian  operations?    [Leotard] Since 9 February, the mission of the UN forces has  changed somewhat. In Sarajevo the 3,000 or so troops are now  intervening a lot more, while before they were hardly  intervening at all, and as a result they are accompanying a lot  fewer humanitarian convoys.    At the same time, there has been an increase in other types  of humanitarian action. On Mount Zuc, a very important  electricity line was destroyed by Serbian bombing. The French  Engineer Corps is trying to repair it. If they succeed, it will  be possible to restart the pumps that supply a part of Sarajevo  with drinking water and to reactivate some heating facilities.  That would be a real civilian victory which would restore the  people's confidence.    [LE FIGARO] If there are air strikes, is there a parallel  process of political attempts toward finding a solution?    [Leotard] The whole operation consists of using force on the  one hand while above all proposing negotiation on the other. I  have said several times that the use of force itself is  senseless if it has no other aim.    It is all the more true that the air strikes are not an end  in themselves. They are a way of protecting the civilian  population and bringing the belligerents, in particular the  Serbs and the Bosnians, together around the negotiating table.  You saw that, on Tuesday, the meeting that had been planned at  the airport was cancelled by the Bosnian party.    [LE FIGARO] Did that seem to you to be a serious sign?    [Leotard] Neither party has any reason to exclude itself  from  discussions.    [LE FIGARO] Is there the risk of the UN troops being caught  in the crossfire?    [Leotard] As I said, for several weeks now there have been  no  risk-free policies. There are hopeless policies, such as  getting bogged down, but there are no longer any risk-free  policies. We have to accept a degree of risk if we want to free  ourselves from this deadlocked situation, where humanitarian  convoys are being attacked, people are being pinned down, and  supplies are increasingly failing to get through. We have  examined this situation with the other European powers that are  the most actively involved in Bosnia. All our policies include  a degree of risk, if we try to maintain the previous situation,  if we withdraw, or if we keep to the stance taken today.    [LE FIGARO] Do these risks also include the problem of  moving  from being the peace-keeper to the peace-maker?    [Leotard] Everything I have just described is the  consequence  and the strict application of resolution 836. That is what I  recently told the Russians. We are only applying a resolution  that was adopted unanimously by the members of the Security  Council.    I notice that, while we are applying it in Sarajevo, it is  not being respected in Bihac, Tuzla, or Srebenica. The United  Nations identified six safe areas, but we are only applying this  resolution in Sarajevo.    [LE FIGARO] Through a lack of resources or a lack of  political will?    [Leotard] For the moment, through a lack of resources,  because, since resolution 836 was passed in June 1993, no  country has responded to France's call or followed our lead.  However, we have to ask ourselves whether we really do want to  apply the UN resolutions. As we speak, Bihac is being bombed,  Tuzla is being bombed, and Srebenica is being bombed by  aggressors who are going unpunished.    [LE FIGARO] At the 11 January NATO summit, the French  priority was Tuzla and Srebenica....    [Leotard] The massacre perpetrated on 5 February made  international public opinion aware of the seriousness of the  situation in Sarajevo. The situation is, keeping things in  proportion, a little less serious in Tuzla and, generally, in  the Bihac enclave. However, we are not abandoning any of our  aims. You know that French troops are currently on the ground  in Bihac.    In addition, in the European Union's plan, which is and  which  will remain the diplomatic objective, the area around Sarajevo  is considered as having the right to UN administration for two  years. France is looking for this plan to be applied. If we  manage to find a solution for Sarajevo, maybe it will serve as a  model.    [LE FIGARO] The United Nations came to Yugoslavia with the  agreement of all three parties....    [Leotard] Yes, and we remain there on that understanding. We  currently hold Sarajevo airport with the agreement of both  belligerents. There is permanently one Serb and one Bosnian in  the control tower monitoring aircraft arrivals.    To move from a situation where the trucks will no longer be  painted white in the colors of the United Nations but will  instead be painted khaki and be accompanied by tanks,  helicopters, and artillery, is not currently an option for us.    I know that some people find it hard to believe and that  they  want to "do battle." We have neither the UN mandate that is  required to do that, nor the decision or the support of the  French people and Parliament. France has not declared war on  Serbia, nor has any of the other 30 nations declared war on any  of the three protagonists. Many people would like it to be a  black and white affair, but we have to accept a situation whose  very complexity is the result of post-communism.    [LE FIGARO] Is it possible to avoid the logic of war?    [Leotard] It is true that we are on the fringes of the  military and the humanitarian. If the French, the British, and  anyone else had decided to go to war with Serbia, things would  have appeared a lot less complicated. We would have been  stronger with regard to resources, weapons, or troop numbers.  The Serbs would certainly also have been less arrogant.  However, we have not made any such decision and I do not think  we should. We are intervening in one country, Bosnia  Herzegovina, that is recognized by the United Nations, and which  has a president, a Parliament, and which contains warring  factions. We are not intervening between two states.    [LE FIGARO] All three parties in this UN-recognized state  have formally accepted the European plan for partitioning the  country. Is this plan viable?    [Leotard] The European Union's plan must be one stage on the  path toward a final objective. Considerable progress will have  been made when the three parties have signed and are respecting  a cease-fire agreement.    The next stage would be for the three parties to discuss,  negotiate, and become more open with each other. A no-hope  solution, on the other hand, would be if each party became  entrenched behind its lines of barbed wire -- that would be  absurd.    The strength of the European action plan is that it has been  accepted by all three parties and that it is the only one that  exists. It is designed to favor the return to a stable  situation, giving people time to once more adapt to peace and  civilized life. Civilized life comes through exchange, not  through entrenchment.    [LE FIGARO] Does that mean that a Bosnian Federation remains  the political objective?    [Leotard] To be a man of peace means having a great deal of  humility. I do not see how we could decree solutions that today  are violently refused by the parties. It cannot be imposed  through war. In any case, no European state envisages that.    [LE FIGARO] For any initiative to succeed, do we not need  the  support of the whole international community, including the  Russians?    [Leotard] For the security of western Europe, Russia is an  essential and probably the most important partner. To settle a  crisis like the one in Yugoslavia, Russia's participation in a  political solution is absolutely vital.

Patrick Mizrahi, you are  outside the Hotel Matignon where the prime minister has just  made a statement.    [Mizrahi] In a 45-minute meeting in Matignon, a few hours  before the expiration of the NATO ultimatum, Edouard Balladur  had around him Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Defense Minister  Francois Leotard, and government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy.  Also there were Elysee Secretary General Hubert Vedrine,  General Quesnot, the private presidential chief of staff, and  Admiral Lanxade, Armed Foreces chief of staff. Just one  watchword: firmness.    [Begin Balladur recording] The ultimatum must be respected,  and it must be respected today, tomorrow, and the day after  tomorrow. Our aim is not war but peace. But everyone must take  all the necessary measures for this to happen.    Originally it was a humanitarian mission and still is one,  but it is true that if things were to evolve, all measures must  be taken to ensure, as far as possible, the protection of our  soldiers. [end recording]    [Mizrahi] Edouard Balladur added that France was the  defender  of international law and morality. At 2130 it will be the turn  of Francois Mitterrand to meet the prime minister, the minister  of defense, and the minister of foreign affairs in the Elysee.

headline:    Holds News Conference 
text:  Language:   French   Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has just given a  news conference after meeting leaders of the main political  parties in France to brief them on the situation in Bosnia.  Edouard Balladur:    [Begin Balladur recording] Since yesterday, we have been  able  to see that our firm stand, which we had called for, and which  was initiated by our country and our diplomacy, has been a  success. At the moment we speak, we can say that it was a  success. This does not necessarily mean that everything has  been solved, and many problems remain to be solved.  Nevertheless, our assessment of the situation at this stage  shows that the alliance's decision, acting within an  international mandate, has, for the most part, been respected.  Is this a definitive situation, is it a lasting situation? The  future will tell, but it is our duty to [words indistinct].    Our attention now turns to the follow-up to this action from  the point of view of a lasting solution to the problems of  Bosnia- Herzegovina. This first of all means a solution of the  situation in Sarajevo, with the restoration of free movement,  the lifting of the siege, and the international administration  of the city, which seems to many to be the only way of providing  a lasting solution to the problem. Second, it means the  solution of the problems facing a number of other towns or  regions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which have been designated as  safe areas, and which sometimes have not been safe areas, and  where the situation remains unchanged. Finally, it means a  solution of the overall problem of Bosnia, in other words  progress towards a lasting peace.    You know that the European Union has drawn up a plan. This  plan is on the table. It is not a rigid plan, it can still be  debated, and we are quite prepared to discuss it with our  partners within whatever framework or organization. What is  essential is that, thanks to this action, we can gradually move  towards a solution of the situation in Bosnia. [end recording].

text:  Language:   French   Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe met his British  counterpart Douglas Hurd, this afternoon. Paris and London  agree to extend the UN soldiers' action on the ground to those  towns still under siege in the former Yugoslavia. Alain Juppe:    [Begin Juppe recording] A first step has been made, as we  have all said. Having said that, a lot remains to be done:  First, in order to guarantee the effective lifting of the siege  of Sarajevo and to rebuild this town ruined by war; second, in  order to extend our action to all safe areas or all besieged  towns in Bosnia, and third, in order to promote a global peace  plan without which a stable solution cannot be found. There has  been convergence on all these issues.    I would like to point out that a number of decisions have  already been taken. I am thinking in particular of Tuzla and  Srebrenica, two safe areas covered by Resolution 836, and on  which the Council of the Atlantic Alliance took a very clear  stance on 10 and 11 January. As you know, the aim is to reopen  Tuzla airport for humanitarian purposes, and to restore freedom  of movement in Srebrenica again, in particular for UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces]. We [Juppe and Hurd] both hope that these  decisions will be implemented in the very near future. [end  recording]

headline:    Mitterrand: Bosnian Struggle Enters `New Phase' 
text:  Language:   French   Article Type:BFN     [Address to the nation by President Francois Mitterrand from   the Elysee in Paris on 21 February--live or recorded]    [Text] My dear compatriots: The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina  entered a new phase in Sarajevo last night. The Serbs, who have  been besieging the town, inflicting thousands of deaths and  terrible suffering for the people, have withdrawn most of their  heavy weapons, guns, mortars, and tanks, within a radius of 20  km. The weapons that have not been withdrawn are now grouped  under the control of UN Forces. The first condition was met  within the allotted time. The North Atlantic Council set the  deadline on 9 February at the request of France and the United  States, and it was meant for both the Serbs and the Bosnian  Government.    Last night, I invited the prime minister, the ministers of  defense and foreign affairs, as well as the chief of staff, to  the Elysee in order to take stock of the situation. From the  Elysee I called General Cot, who is commanding the UN Protection  Forces on the ground in the former Yugoslavia. He told us that  the withdrawal of Serb weapons was accelerating.    I then called Washington, where President Clinton, who had  just talked with Mr. Yeltsin, confirmed the information given by  General Cot. We agreed that if events unfold as they are  expected to until the deadline [as heard], it will not be  necessary to use our military means. Since the information we  received from our own services confirmed this, air strikes did  not take place.    The withdrawal of heavy weapons was obtained thanks to the  determination of the allies and the moderating intervention of  the Russians with the Serbs. Need I emphasize the role played  by France, which from the beginning originated all of the  initiatives aimed at settling the conflict, and which has given  the United Nations the largest contingent of peace soldiers? We  need only look at the most recent events. May I remind you that  it was in the wake of the talks that took place 15 days ago  between Mr. Juppe and American Secretary of State Christopher,  that it was possible to find an outcome.    However, much remains to be done. It is necessary to  consolidate the lifting of the siege in Sarajevo. The  cease-fire has been heeded so far, but freedom of movement for  people and humanitarian convoys has not yet been restored.  People are still living in fear.    It is clear that any violation of the decisions of the  Atlantic Alliance will be....[pauses] would be punished  tomorrow as we had intended to do today. I hope that the most  will be made of the time we have saved and of this first success  of reason over so many murderous passions, in order to extend  allied pressure to the other Bosnian towns, to the other zones  of this country where violence is rife. We will thus give a new  impetus to the search for a political settlement, for there can  only be a negotiated solution.    Consultations will take place within the next few days. As  early as this week France will appeal to the Security Council  and ask its members to put Sarajevo under UN administration.    We shall not slacken our efforts. The minister of defense  and and the minister of foreign affairs are following the  development of events--under the authority of the prime  minister--just as I am, hour by hour.    I presided over a restricted meeting this afternoon, as I  did  yesterday. The same will happen over the next few days, and, if  some among you listening to me are wondering, I will tell you:  What is happening in the Balkans affects us, it affects France.  Beyond the human solidarity demanded by the scope of this  tragedy, yes, this affects us, as other things did in the past.  Similar conflicts can flare up at any time. Born from the  dislocation of the Soviet Union and from the solution which will  prevail in Bosnia, many things will happen.    I am about to conclude, my dear compatriots. Let us think of  the 18 French soldiers killed, of the 281 injured in that part  of the world, and let us appreciate together the value of their  sacrifice for the sake of peace. Long live the republic, long  live France.

headline:    Leotard Interviewed on Serbian Artillery Withdrawal 
text:  Language:   French   Article Type:BFN     [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by   unidentified correspondent -- live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Francois Leotard, thank you for  joining us in the studio. [passage omitted] My first question:  is the withdrawal of Serb heavy artillery real or not?    [Leotard] Yes, yes. Of course, there can be, here or there,  a weapon that might have been left behind, but these are only  exceptions, and these exceptions are in fact often condemned by  the Serbs themselves. In other words, to sum things up: about  50 percent of the weapons around Sarajevo -- and there were  indeed more of them than we thought -- have been pulled back  beyond the 20-km perimeter or taken to Pale, which is the  enclave where the Bosnian Serbs have their parliament. There is  a large concentration of weapons there. I have photos that show  this quite clearly, but they are allowed to keep them there,  since we had allowed a two-km zone around Pale, which was not  threatened by air strikes. The other 50 percent have been  gathered together in barracks, in emplacements controlled by  armed members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].    [Correspondent] So you are not worried by pictures showing a  few undeclared Serb weapons?    [Leotard] No, there might still be a few tomorrow morning.  You know, until recently, we did not have any helicopters in  Sarajevo. France sent two helicopters at first, then four, and  they are now going from hill to hill to control this perimeter,  which covers some 12-13,000 square km.    [Correspondent] Is this withdrawal just tactical or is it  sincere? Have the Serbs promised not to come back anywhere near  Sarajevo?    [Leotard] No, no, we simply said: If you do that, if you  keep  these weapons, we will bomb them, so they are either leaving or  being regrouped. Of course, if they were to come back -- this  must be quite clear to everyone -- if they were to come back, we  would bomb. That must be quite clear. Yesterday, we met in  northern Italy with defense ministers from America, Holland,  Great Britain, and we said we would maintain our air deployment,  and that we would keep to the conditions of the ultimatum. If a  weapon comes back, it will be bombed -- this must be quite clear  -- and if a shell were to land on the civilian population, we  would punish those who had fired it. All this must be quite  clear.    [Correspondent] So it is out of the question that they  should  shell Sarajevo again?    [Leotard] Out of the question. You may have heard that  General Cot repeated this today at my request, and I can repeat  it to you now: we came to an agreement with the allies and with  the other defense ministers in Italy yesterday, and the  deployment will be maintained. We have not set an end date for  that deployment.    [Correspondent] So any strike could happen without an  ultimatum, without warning?    [Leotard] Absolutely. We have no need, either for a new  meeting of the North Atlantic Council, or for a new meeting of  the Security Council. Everyone must know that, and we will keep  our deployment for as long as necessary.    [Correspondent] Both the president and the prime minister  have said that if they withdrew, it was because our firm stand  had paid off.    [Leotard] It is true. It is absolutely true. There is no  doubt that, because of the cohesion of the allies, because of  the cohesion of the French executive also, we showed that there  were no chinks in our determination.    [Correspondent] Why don't we show the same determination for  Tuzla, for Zepa? The fighting carries on outside Sarajevo. Why  don't we do the same thing there?    [Leotard] First, there is a material problem, a problem of  means. You know that France already has some 9,000 men on the  ground, by far the largest contingent. There is also a  scheduling problem. We are currently planning the Tuzla  operation....    [Correspondent interrupting] In other words?    [Leotard] In other words, we would like Tuzla airport, which  lies to the north of the Muslim-held pocket....[pauses] This  airport is very interesting for humanitarian aid. We want to  take control of this airport and ensure that if ever planes  bringing in humanitarian aid were attacked by the besieging  Serbs....[pauses] Well, there also we would like to strike.    [Correspondent] So you want to press home your advantage?    [Leotard] We want to press home our advantage. You might  remember that Tuzla and Srebrenica are two of the areas  considered at the NATO summit on 12 January. So we are still  pursuing this aim. Another aim could be to bring the greater  Sarajevo area under UN supervision -- this possibility was  already being considered last August -- and this would mean  taking on the civilian administration -- gas, water,  electricity, security.    [Correspondent] Let us imagine that after this NATO  ultimatum, calm were suddenly to return to the whole of Bosnia.    [Leotard] I am less confident about this than you are. I  fear alas that in certain areas -- Mostar, Bihac, Srebrenica, to  quote but a few -- the warring parties are in a situation where  shelling continues, sieges are under way as we speak. We have  to do something about this. I once said that there was a  terrible game in this land, a game of hatred, of violence. It  started off as a Serbian aggression, but now it is happening on  all sides, so this is a terribly difficult task for UNPROFOR.  We have to go about it sector by sector, town by town, with a  lot of tenacity.    [Correspondent] So let us be quite clear: NATO has won a  lull, but the war goes on.    [Leotard] It is a stage. As the president of the republic  said, it is a turning point in this crisis in this horrible war,  a turning point in the right direction, without doubt. The very  fact of seeing women and children walking outside, like human  beings in Sarajevo, this is a wonderful reward for UNPROFOR.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Francois Mitterrand said that Russia had had  a moderating influence in the crisis. Is this the right term?  Wasn't the West afraid of seeing a return to the cold war, with  Russia playing this rather strange game?    [Leotard] We must always be very careful, but I don't think  so. I am glad that the Russians are involved. Russia is in the  process of democratization, and I am glad that it contributes to  security issues in Europe. We wanted this. Alain Juppe said  so, and so did I. I went to see Russian Defense Minister  Grachev some two weeks ago, and Mr. Kozyrev, and told them this.  We wanted Russia to have this attitude. It is a positive  contribution, for now. Let us enjoy the sight of a European  city returning to life. [passage omitted].    [Correspondent] Thank you, Francois Leotard.

headline:    Says More Tanks To Be Sent to Sarajevo 
text:  Language:   English   Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 22 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister  Francois Leotard on Tuesday [22 February] told senators France  would send 10 to 20 Sagaie tanks to Sarajevo in the next few  days to boost existing materiel for United Nations troops.    The chairman of the Senate Defence and Foreign Affairs  Committee, Xavier de Villepin, told AFP Leotard had noted that  UN troops were lightly armed and confirmed that Sagaie tanks  would be sent in the near future.    The tanks, which are equipped with 90-mm guns, will be  shipped to former Yugoslavia from the southern port of Toulon,  he said.    He emphasised that the tanks were to reinforce materiel for  troops already on the ground and would not be operated by the  troop reinforcements France has pledged.    French UN troops in Bosnia are already equipped with this  type of tank, which is the heaviest weapon in their armoury.

headline:    Sees `Turning Point' in Bosnia 
text:  Language:   French   Article Type:BFN     [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by   Franz-Olivier Giesbert on 21 February--live]    [Text] [Giesbert] The defense minister is the man everyone  wants to hear this morning. Thank you for coming to answer our  questions. First, can we regard what happened yesterday as a  victory, a great victory, for NATO and for France?    [Leotard] I won't use the word victory for the moment. It is  a stage. It is a positive stage on a path where other stages  have been very negative. There is still a war situation on the  ground, in many other places. The town of Sarajevo is still  under siege. The people lack food, they cannot leave.  Elsewhere towns are being shelled, women and children are still  in a very dangerous situation. I think we have to realize that  we issued threats, we threatened to use force, and I am glad to  see that this threat worked, that it made it possible to achieve  a result, and that it hasn't yet been used.    [Giesbert] For you, it is a small first step?    [Leotard] It is a step, it is a stage, and a positive one,  of  course, because what we wanted is happening. But it isn't over.    [Giesbert] It is not all done. For example, we have heard  every figure as far as estimates are concerned: for the United  Nations, 100 percent of the Serb heavy weapons were neutralized  or moved yesterday; for Karadzic, the head of the Bosnian Serbs  it was 50 percent; for Francois Mitterrand it was 80 percent.  Has the ultimatum been respected 100 percent, 90, 80 or 50  percent?    [Leotard] You know, day is breaking. Yesterday afternoon we  sent two helicopters to Sarajevo, since the planes had problems  because of the weather. So now again today these helicopters  are going to fly over the hills around Sarajevo. A number of  guns, if they are still there, are there for technical reasons.  The Serbs themselves showed us that they couldn't move them any  more either because there was no more petrol, or the engine of a  tank had disappeared, or they were concreted in.    [Giesbert] And do you believe this?    [Leotard] We checked. We checked. And we will continue to  do so today. You must remember that the ultimatum is still  there as far as the means of carrying it out are concerned.  That is to say that if ever there is to be shelling, for  example, of course the hardware that has been assembled, the  aircraft, would be used. That is clear.    [Giesbert] So you are saying now, this morning, that there  could still be air strikes?    [Leotard] Of course. Of course. We really mustn't -- I was  going to say, disarm ourselves.    [Giesbert] So you haven't given in to Serb strategems, as  the  Bosnian Muslims are accusing you of having done?    [Leotard] No, not at all. Let me remind you that were there  to be shooting from the Muslim side, they would undergo the same  treatment. Let me repeat, we are not there to make war on one  of the sides, we are there to enforce respect for a UN  resolution, and what is to be regretted is that we were not able  to do it earlier, for all sorts of reasons. Now we have to be  firm about implementing what the ultimatum actually says, that's  to say the use of aerial force should there be shelling of the  civilian population.    And I will add a second very important factor: the town of  Sarajevo is still under siege at this moment, and it is  essential to get the siege of Sarajevo lifted. This is our aim  now.    [Giesbert] That was the aim of the ultimatum, if I  understand  it rightly? It seems that you have given a short period of  grace, a short extension, to the Serbs?    [Leotard] There wasn't even half an hour's extension. Not  even half an hour.    [Giesbert] Ah, because you are not yet quite sure that the  ultimatum is being respected?    [Leotard] No, not at all. I have just said that according to  our information, all, or almost all, the weapons have been  withdrawn. We will check during the morning hours whether it is  all of them, and whether there is no dishonesty: it is a  question of hours, but of course we are keeping the possibility.  All the officials (?of the EU) and my counterpart ministers of  defense repeated the same thing as I did yesterday in Italy, and  so we are keeping the possibility of doing so. Everyone must  know that our resolve remains intact.    [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, isn't the danger now that the Serb  arms might be deployed elsewhere in Bosnia? The weapons that  have left the surroundings of Sarajevo will be used elsewhere?    [Leotard] That's what I said at the beginning, that we are  still in a conflict situation. So when a weapon has not been  confiscated and taken under UN control, it is moved to be used,  unfortunately. We are in a country where towns are still under  siege, and shelling is taking place. So what you are saying is  quite clear: there are risks elsewhere now, and what I would  like is for the dynamics of the victory on the diplomatic level  -- victory is the word you used -- the dynamics of this sea  change on the diplomatic level, to get the situation to improve  elsewhere.    [Giesbert] So basically you are telling us: we will continue  to put pressure on the Serbs?    [Leotard] Absolutely. And I am convinced that we have to put  it not only on the Serbs, but on the Bosnians too.    [Giesbert] Is that what Edouard Balladur's statement meant  yesterday, when he told us that the ultimatum would stay in  force for a few more days?    [Leotard] We and the other allies took the decision to  retain the air contingent, which is large, and the first  infringement will be very seriously punished, and at the same  time decided to continue pressure diplomatically and  politically, so that, for example, one of the aims we are  pursuing, namely to put the sector of the Sarajevo district  under UN control, can be put into effect. This presupposes huge  diplomatic efforts. For the moment the local people, the Serbs  and the Bosnians, say they are willing, but the conditions are  not right. That probably means that at the UN Security Council  there will be initiatives, it means that there will be extra  troops on the ground, for example, it means a number of  conditions which at the present moment have not been met.    [Giesbert] From what you are saying, Mr. Leotard, we cannot  help feeling that in fact everything is just beginning now?    [Leotard] I think a lot of people have made the mistake of  thinking that...    [Giesbert, interrupting] It is not over, it is beginning?    [Leotard] Yes, exactly, that the end of the time limit was  the end of the war. The end of the time limit is the beginning  of another period.    [Giesbert] Yesterday evening we avoided the  internationalization of the fighting, but it can still get  internationalized?    [Leotard] We are by no means out of the woods as far as this  danger is concerned. You know that we are there to a large  extent to avoid this. It is a conflict that has very serious  potential dangers for Europe, so if there are 9,000 French  soldiers there in the area of operations as a whole, in the  Adriatic and in Yugoslavia, we are there mainly to prevent this  conflict from flaring up.    Let me take the chance to tell you that I hope everyone  realizes that the 270 French injured, the 18 dead we have  suffered, all this has not been pointless. France's physical  effort, the effort of its troops, of its lads, has not been  pointless, because I am thinking of them today. I think that  what they did made it possible for peace to move forward.    [Giesbert] You told me just now that we must not focus all  attention on the tragedy of Sarajevo. It is true that there at  the moment there are other tragedies -- there is the tragedy in  Tuzla, for example. Yesterday the Serbs fired three shells.  There is Mostar, where the Serbs and Muslims are resisting the  Croats, there is Bihac.    [Leotard] There is Srebrenica, there are numerous towns.    [Giesbert] Don't we need to make ultimatums now for Tuzla,  Mostar, Bihac, and the others?    [Leotard] I think so. We have to use the enormous air force  that we have now gathered round and over Yugoslavia so that the  process of negotiation and political discussion can go on. We  have always said, and I repeat it again, that there is no  military victory in the real sense of the word is possible on  the ground, so now the force we put on show, the force we  demonstrated, can have its effect without being used. That is  the principle of forces for democracies, in fact.    [Giesbert] The force you are talking about, is simply a  turning point for European defense?    [Leotard] I think it is a real turning point, or in any case  I hope so, and I am saying this without self-satisfaction for  the French government, or for France in general. It is a  turning point above all, because French concepts have gradually  been accepted. We are the ones who have been behind all the  diplomatic and military initiatives from the beginning. We were  the ones who asked for the creation of protected zones. We were  the ones who asked for corridors. We were the ones who provided  troops. Today about half the planes are French planes. So it  was France which took all these initiatives, and it hopes the  other Europeans will grasp the dimensions of the Yugoslav  tragedy.    [Giesbert] You speak of France, but there is another country  that has returned in strength to the diplomatic scene, Russia.  Are you glad?    [Leotard] In a way, yes. I'll tell you why.    [Giesbert] Why in a way? Because you feel a bit that it is  playing a double game?    [Leotard] As long as Russia is in the process of becoming  democratic, it is and can be a partner for security in Europe.  Of course this condition: as long as Russia is becoming  democratic is important. It is doing this. But I think that  the Europeans must realize that Russia is a factor in the  security if it becomes a democratic country. Why not? Because  it is a power which has strategic interests in Europe and round  Europe. So we can enter a partnership of dialogue for the  architecture of security in Europe.    [Giesbert] We now have to think of political solutions, Mr.  Leotard. It is time for diplomacy too. What do you want to see  in Bosnia -- there are several solutions: there is partition,  there is cantonization.    [Leotard] First of all -- and it wasn't me who thought of it  -- it is up to the different sides, the three sides who are  still making war, to sit down round the table. Several months  ago they accepted a scenario of -- we say partition, but I hope  it won't be partition, because these people have to live  together. Trade exchange and a common currency. In other  words, that they should manage to find the tools themselves, and  define the tools of cooperation between them. If they didn't do  that, we would have a continuation of the war, because these are  scattered pieces of territory, as you saw on the map. So they  have to continue to be able to make exchanges on this part of  the European continent. That is one of the most important aims  for us.    [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, you and Edouard Balladur are going  to  receive the political leaders today. What are you going to tell  them?    [Leotard] The prime minister took the wise decision, and a  brave one, to consult all the French political forces. He asked  Mr. Juppe and me to be with him. I think this is a good picture  of what a government can do, first to act, first to face up to  its responsibilities and commit itself to its actions, and at  the same time to consult the political forcs of the country to  get them to ponder this tragedy.    [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Leotard.

headline:    Reynolds on Northern Ireland Talks With Major 
text:  Language:   English   Article Type:BFN     [Text] New talks on the future of Northern Ireland would go  ahead, with or without Sinn Fein, Irish Premier Albert Reynolds  said today.    Speaking after Saturday's [19 February] 90-minute meeting in  London with Mr. Major, the Taoiseach [prime minister] warned the  IRA and Sinn Fein they would not have a better opportunity to  enter the political process. He denied setting a deadline of  March 17 for a Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street peace  declaration. Both he and Mr. Major had made it clear the door  to peace would not be closed, said Mr. Reynolds.    "We are not closing the door to peace, we are not going to  lock that door and throw away the key." But he added: "I do not  think the overwhelming support of the Irish people can be  ignored. This is a new opportunity, there is never going to be  a better offer on the table and I cannot see what justification  there would be for the continuation of violence or the taking of  one more innocent life."    During their meeting at Downing Street on Saturday both  leaders agreed to resume the three-strand Northern Ireland talks  process.    Mr. Reynolds told Irish radio the talks would be based on  the  principles enshrined in the declaration. "The new starting  point will be the peace declaration. That has not been clear up  to now, we finally agreed it on Saturday. We also agreed that  it is a three-stranded process and not an internal settlement as  some people were suggesting."    Mr. Reynolds said it was helpful that Mr. Major had  reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration. "It was important  that the British prime minister said it because I think there  were people who were suspecting that maybe the British  Government in some way or another were not behind the  declaration."    Mr. Reynolds quashed hopes that the Sinn Fein annual  conference next weekend would deliver a response to the Downing  St. declaration, saying: "I never expected that forum to be the  forum at which the response would be put together." But he  hoped sufficient people would recognise that the road to peace  was "a better road to choose to pursue their political  objectives rather than the road to violence which in the last 25  years has been carried on by paramilitaries on both sides.  There will be no military victories."    Mr. Reynolds said: "We want people to sit back, study  exactly  where they have come from, where they are at and which road has  the best chance of advancing the cause of nationalism. We  believe the peace process is the only road."    Earlier, Mr. Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's The World This  Weekend that progress was likely within a month.    "Saturday's meeting cleared the air and we have now agreed  on  the basis for the new talks, which is that the peace declaration  will form the basis for the resumption of talks. That will be  the new starting point," he said.    And Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew told the  same programme that no party, including the Rev. Ian Paisley's  hardline Democratic Unionists, could be allowed to veto progress  of the peace talks.    Meanwhile, Irish Deputy Premier Dick Spring called on the  IRA  and Sinn Fein to show "leadership and courage" and accept the  Downing Street peace declaration.    But speaking on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost programme he  conceded that the IRA and Sinn Fein might never respond to the  peace initiative.    John Hume, the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] leader,  said he did not agree with the view that the Declaration was  unacceptable to Sinn Fein.    He told the London Weekend Television Walden programme: "My  reading is that they are still giving it detailed study, which  is what I expected, given the nature of that organisation.    "Their immediate reaction is suspicion and that is what I  expect. But they have not rejected the Declaration. They have  asked for clarification."    Mr. Hume said that peace in Ireland was above party  politics. "I am putting it above party politics myself in the  dialogue that I have been engaged in, so I would feel that what  the British Government should do now is to directly clarify to  them whatever they want clarified."

headline:    Official Views Situation After Expiry of NATO Ultimatum 
text:  Language:   German   Article Type:BFN     [Telephone interview with Friedrich Bohl, minister in the   FRG Chancellor's Office, by Hans-Joachim Wiese in Hamburg --  live]    [Text] [Wiese] Good morning.    [Bohl] Good morning.    [Wiese] How does the FRG Government assess the fact that the  NATO ultimatum has expired without the threatened air strikes  having been necessary?    [Bohl] Well, the situation is that NATO and the United  Nations are making it clear after all that air strikes are not  required now and this development is very positive. I think it  is always good if war-like and military conflicts or strikes are  not necessary. In this respect, it is certainly a good  development.    [Wiese] International deliberations on a new peace  initiative for Bosnia are to be held in Bonn tomorrow.  Chancellor Kohl is said to have suggested these talks in a  telephone conversation with Russian President Yeltsin. Is this  correct?    [Bohl] Well, over the past few days the chancellor had many  telephone conversations, particularly with the U.S. President  and the Russian president. I think one can say the chancellor  has done his decisive share in the fact that we will now have an  apparently good round of high-standard talks in the diplomatic  sector. I think that major credit for the present development  goes to the chancellor.    [Wiese] What will be the contents of these talks, Mr. Bohl?  Can you give any details?    [Bohl] No. I neither can nor want to do this. The FRG  foreign minister already made relevant statements yesterday  evening. Nothing more can be said at the moment. It would also  be inappropriate to do this now. I ask you to understand this.  However, as I have said, I hope that we now have a positive  basic tendency and we will make progress now.    [Wiese] You referred to FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.  He also called for a solution for the Bosnian areas that are  still contested, for example, Bihac and Tuzla. Is another NATO  ultimatum conceivable for these areas?    [Bohl] I really ask you to understand that I do not want to  comment on this. I do not want to make any statement that goes  beyond what the foreign minister has already said.    [Wiese] How does the Federal Government assess the role of  Russia in connection with the NATO ultimatum?    [Bohl] Well, I think it has already been expressed in my  response to your question regarding the decisive progress in  this respect made by the chancellor, the U.S. President, and the  Russian president and mention of the fact that Russia has  certainly made a decisive contribution to the present  development. Altogether I think it has to be very positively  assessed that all those who are responsible are making great  efforts to prevent the further escalation of this conflict and  to achieve a tendency toward peace. I think it is important  that the Balkans not become a powder keg, that all responsible  persons are making efforts to prevent this -- apparently with  success -- and to achieve a peaceful development in the Balkans,  which will probably be unstable for many years.    [Wiese] However, Mr. Bohl, rather threatening voices were  still heard from Moscow yesterday. For example, Churkin,  Russian envoy to the Balkans, urgently warned NATO against going  ahead with its threat. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said he  is not at all interested in the ultimatum. Are these arguments  to achieve a strong position or what does that mean?    [Bohl] Well, I do not want to comment on that. For me, the  result counts. I want to continue to evaluate it as has already  been done.    [Wiese] My last question: What are the Federal Government's  ideas of the next steps in and around Sarajevo? In other words,  what do you think of the proposal to place Sarajevo under UN  control?    [Bohl] We want to leave that for the further talks.    [Wiese] Thank you for this interview.

headline:    Press Views Expiration of NATO Ultimatum for Serbs 
text:  Language:   German   Article Type:BFN     [From the press review]     [Text] The German press today comments on the expiration  of the NATO ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs.    SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG writes: On the day after the expiration  of the NATO ultimatum, the United Nations and NATO must admit  they are still at the beginning. The threat of the use of force  was only the first step and not the finale. NATO and the United  Nations must not decrease their efforts. Direct pressure on all  parties to the war must continue to exist until the fight  against the siege of Sarajevo is finally over. If NATO and the  United Nations achieve in the long run [a situation in which]  shots are no longer fired in Sarajevo, this would bring great  relief. However, the town can only survive if peace is restored  in other areas, too. Public attention has mainly focused on the  Bosnian capital in this war. However, it was overlooked that  the fiercest fighting took place in other regions, and that  Sarajevo was not so important for the Serbs.    NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG points out: Despite the modest  hope that is budding in view of developments in Sarajevo, the  rest of Bosnia must not be forgotten. Fighting is still going  on in many places. The community of states must show the same  determination with which it supported a cease-fire in the  capital in other focal points, too -- in Tuzla, for example,  where the Serbs launched new attacks during the weekend, or in  Gorazde, Srebrenica, or Mostar. Otherwise the chances for peace  that were created in Sarajevo will again be wasted.    LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG stresses another aspect. The NATO  ultimatum for Sarajevo does not only mean a decision for the  Serbs over war or peace with NATO, but it is part of the  historic changes that are currently taking place. Bosnia is not  a NATO member, and no NATO state has been attacked. Still, NATO  prepared itself for military strikes -- for the first time under  such preconditions since its founding in 1949. Thus, NATO has  abandoned the principles valid during the East-West  confrontation and has broken new ground the outline of which is  not yet clearly discernible. The assessment of this step will  probably only be possible after the next few decades, when new  global structures are developed.    DIE WELT states: Russia's return to the policy vis-a-vis the  Balkans is of particular significance. With the deployment of  Russian soldiers in the Bosnian theater of war, Moscow has  adopted a leading position allowing it to codetermine or block  any political solution. Blocking NATO was one of Moscow's goals  from the very beginning. Because of increased consideration for  Russia's interests, the consequences will become visible in  Athens, Ankara, and everywhere else in southeastern Europe.  Russia is behaving like a major European power, and it will  again find political customers via Belgrade, particularly  because the internal cohesion of NATO has been critically  weakened at its southern flank. Not only the situation around  Sarajevo has changed but the European situation, too.

headline:    Iranian Debts Cause Waigel To Fear Budget Problems 
text:  Language:   German   Article Type:BFN     [Report by Heinz Heck: "Waigel Fears Addendum to the   Budget"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- In 1994, the federal budget will be  faced with additional burdens from business with Iran of up to 4  billion German marks [DM]. This is the amount of short-term  loans (duration of up to 12 months) that the Federal Government  had covered via the Hermes credit insurance and which are now  having problems or will endure problems by the end of this year.  Since no precautions have been taken in the federal budget's  guarantee account for damage caused by Iranian loans, the  Federal Government wants to avoid a rescheduling of the debts,  which would force it to pay approximately 90 percent  immediately. Ten percent would have to be covered by the  exporters themselves.    Otherwise, an addendum to the budget of DM3-4 billion would  certainly become necessary, Bonn fears -- and right in the hot  stage of the election campaign in autumn. The responsible  ministries (Finance Ministry and Economics Ministry) and Hermes  are, therefore, currently negotiating with the Iranian Central  Bank Markazi about an almost unique refinancing:    A consortium of German banks is to grant a loan for the  entire amount, including the exporters' retention, until 1995  and is to receive a guarantee for that by the Federal  Government. Already approved compensations of approximately  DM420 million are to be included in the transaction so as to  spare the budget.    Since the debts involve around 1,000 indivdiaul demands by  up  to 700 exporters, refinancing could not be coordinated  differently at short notice anyway. Hermes has written to the  exporters that conduct business with Iran and has requested  details on their guaranteed demands. The costs of the unusual  transaction are to be paid by Iran. This was negotiated until  yesterday; the result is still open. [passage omitted]

headline:    Finance Ministry Denies Report 
text:  Language:   German   Article Type:BFN     ["hen"-signed report: "Iranian Risks Do Not Require   Addendum to the Budget"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- The FRG Finance Ministry on Friday [18  February] confirmed upon inquiry that Iran is in danger of being  in default with approximately 4 billion German marks [DM] of  short-term liabilities, which have developed within the  framework of Hermes-covered trade. In this connection, however,  the ministry denied a report by DIE WELT, claiming that this  loss in payments would have already its full effect on the  federal budget in 1994 and would require an addendum to the  budget.    Rather, it is true that Iran currently has problems with  repaying short-term Hermes-covered trade loans on time.  Meanwhile, DM420 million of that have been recognized as losses  and compensation has been paid to the German creditors. The  total amount of DM4 billion will be "refinanced" from short to  medium-term loans by a German banking consortium -- as this has  been done in the past -- so that one cannot speak of a specific  risk to the budget for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, it  is a fact that Iran has serviced its medium and long-term loans  punctually so far and is, therefore, not to be considered a bad  debtor, it was noted. In the view of experts, Iran's short-term  payment problems are primarily due to oscillating oil prices, as  well as the country's temporary great need for imports. [passage  omitted]

headline:    IG Metall-Gesamtmetall Talks Fail; More Strikes Likely 
text:  Language:   English   Article Type:BFN     [Report by Michael Anders: "German Metalworkers Get Set To   Go on All-Out Strike"]    [Text] Bonn, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Workers in Germany's key  metalworking and electrical industries are getting ready to face  their employers and the government with an all-out strike to  defend their pay-packets.    By Friday afternoon [18 February], all 14 regions of the  powerful IG Metall trade union had declared the failure of  negotiations, clearing the way for a strike ballot which union  leaders are expected to decide when they meet in Frankfurt  Monday.    Under this procedure, and failing any unexpected last-minute  breakthrough, an all-out strike in a chosen region could begin  the first week of March, union sources said. A vote of 75  percent in favour is needed.    Union officials in the heavily-populated industrial  heartland  of North Rhine-Westphalia, who said they were unanimous, asked  that their region be called on to settle the issue "in  particular because of the extremist attitude" of the local  employers.    The employers' federation Gesamtmetall has rejected the  union's demands for a pay increase, insisting that the difficult  situation of its member firms means they have to cut labour  costs to stay in business. It has sought to cut holiday bonuses  and wants the possibility of extending the workweek.    IG Metall, which with 3.2 million members is Europe's  largest  trade union, has offered greater flexibility in working hours in  exchange for job security guarantees, but has rejected any  attempt to impose pay cuts. It has however proposed shorter  hours with some loss of pay.    The dispute has already been festering for weeks, with  government and business spokesmen from Chancellor Helmut Kohl  downwards repeatedly urging compromise in a sector which employs  3.6 million workers and constitutes a pillar of the German  economy.    Since a required notice period ran out January 28, more than  1.2 million workers have taken part in short, "warning" strikes  in western Germany, according to the union, hitting such  household names as Mercedes, Bosch and Siemens.    In a last bid to resolve the dispute, Gesmatmetall president  Hans-Joachim Gottschol held talks at his initiative in Darmstadt  last Friday with IG Metall's national leader Klaus Zwickel, but  these failed to produce agreement.    No new contacts are scheduled, and the union says it plans  to  hold more strikes and demonstrations next week.    Zwickel said he considered it very unlikely that there would  be fresh talks before the strike decision, although he has  repeatedly said that the union wants to avoid a protracted  struggle.    The employers have warned that up to 10 percent of firms  would close with the loss of another 100,000 jobs in such a  event, in a sector which has seen the loss of hundreds of  thousands of jobs in the last two years.    Zwickel said that the union had gone as far as it could, and  an IG Metall source told AFP Friday that Zwickel was under  pressure from the grass-roots which were preventing him from  compromising any further.    But the source said that an all-out strike was not yet  inevitable.    The source also pointed to the danger such a strike would  pose for the government, as the dispute coincides with an  outstanding wage raise demand by 3.5 million public service  workers, for whom Kohl has said he wants a pay freeze.

headline:    Kohl Addresses Businessmen on Development, Programs 
text:  Language:   German   Article Type:BFN     ["Text" of speech delivered by Federal Chancellor Helmut   Kohl on the Day of Medium-Sized Industrial Enterprises of the  Federal Association of German Industry in Magdeburg on 19  January: "Medium-Sized Enterprises -- Driving Force of the  Social Market Economy"]    [Text]  <H6>  I. </H6>   Minister President, dear Mr. Necker, Mayor, Deputies, Ladies  and Gentlemen: First, I would like to seize the opportunity to  wish all a happy new year. The year 1994 is an important one,  in which, in particular, the people here in the new laender are  facing further important steps in our joint future.    When the Federal Association of German Industry held the  first Day of Medium-Sized Industries after the reunification of  our fatherland in Leipzig in April 1991, German unity had been  completed only six months earlier. At that time, we were still  rather at the beginning of the task of establishing independent  medium-sized industrial enterprises in the new laender.    Those who look back at the developments of the past two  years  will realize that the will for independence has developed most  dynamically in the new laender. More than 600,000 companies  have been established, and thousands of successfully  reprivatized enterprises speak for themselves.    I would like to express my gratitude and recognition to the  entrepreneurs in eastern Germany. They have done a great job in  reconstruction, in many cases under tight deadlines and,  especially in the starting phase, also against certain obstacles.    I also would like to thank the enterprises in western  Germany  which, despite the slump in the economy, stuck to their  investment plans in the new laender. It is a pleasure for me to  say today that the business community's promise to double its  purchasing volume in the new laender to 50 billion German marks  [DM] from 1992 to 1995 so far has been kept.    A special word of thanks also goes to those who have  provided  assistance and support for creating jobs for apprentices in the  new laender over the past year. The chambers, but also the land  groups of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI],  provided sufficient training opportunities in 1993.    The medium-sized enterprises are one centerpiece of the  social market economy. It is in the many medium-sized  enterprises in Germany that most people not only find  employment, but also where innovation takes place most rapidly  and frequently, where state-of-the-art products are developed,  and where new markets are explored. We know from 40 years of  experience that the strength and international success of the  German economy are based largely on the existence of a wide and  active foundation of medium-sized enterprises in Germany.    The medium-sized enterprises are, at the same time, a symbol  of individual entrepreneurial freedom and independence. This is  one of the reasons that the old regime in the former GDR tried  to destroy the medium-sized economy. It was only with  unification that the personal and economic freedom necessary for  wide development of business initiative was recreated.    I am glad that the second "Day of Industrial Medium-Sized  Enterprises" after reunification is taking place today in the  new laender. Representatives of medium-sized enterprises from  the old and new laender have come together here in Magdeburg for  an exchange of opinions, for discussing problems, and for  establishing the course of our joint future.    Ladies and Gentlemen, we must vigorously advance  developments  in the new laender in the future, too, and complete the internal  unity of Germany. Had I said five years ago that businessmen  from western and eastern Germany would hold a joint meeting here  in Magdeburg today, most people would have questioned my state  of mind.    Some have not realized yet that we are facing a major  challenge, a challenge unprecedented in history. What is  certain is that somewhat more than three years after  unification, we have made considerable progress on the path  toward internal unity.    After last year's dynamic increase, we are expecting the  economy in the new laender to grow between 6 and 8 percent this  year, too. In 1993, eastern Germany supported growth in all of  Germany and will do so in 1994, too. Until recently, hardly  anyone would have considered this to be possible.    According to a forecast presented by the Hamburg Economic  Research Institute last week, for the first time since  unification exports from eastern Germany will increase. The new  direction of exports, including exports to the West, shows that  the international competitive strength of the enterprises in  eastern Germany is increasing. The new laender already export  more goods to the countries of the European Union [EU] and EFTA  [European Free Trade Association] than to the former East Bloc,  which used to be their main client.    Meanwhile, public as well as private per capita investment  in  eastern Germany, is higher than in western Germany. This year,  even per capita investment in the construction industry will be  higher there than in western Germany.    This has become possible only through the Federal  Government's determined actions. The settlement of inherited  debts in housing construction, which was accomplished and is  mainly funded by the Federal Government, has given an enormous  impulse to investment. The number of construction licenses  increased enormously, from practically zero to an estimated  75,000 in 1993, doubling the 1992 figure.    Housing construction also increased significantly in western  Germany. According to provisional calculations, last year some  430,000 apartments were completed. This year we expect the  construction of half a million new apartments; this is the  highest figure in 16 years.    The Federal Government has increased rapidly and  significantly its financial efforts in all spheres since the  conclusion of unity. I would like to give a few, very  descriptive examples. In the last three and one-half years of  German unity, more telephone connections were made than in the  40 years of the GDR. Rapid communication also facilitates  investment! Within a few years a major development project was  brought under way, and I do not have any doubts that the  activities of the mail service will even be speeded up after the  postal privatization, for which I am yearning.    In order to transform the economy in the new laender and  create new, competitive jobs, existing enterprises must be  modernized and new, competitive enterprises created.    The Trust Agency has done a great job of privatizing  enterprises, and largely concluded its work by the end of last  year. Most of the more than 13,500 privatized enterprises were  sold to medium-sized firms.    In addition, the Trust Agency created a series of measures  especially designed to improve the economic outlook for the  newly established, medium-sized enterprises in the new laender.  These measures range from real estate offers to granting time  to pay the purchasing price and have served to promote the  development of medium-sized industry in the new laender.    In the sphere of trade we are experiencing particularly  rapid  development. In this area, privatization was concluded two and  one-half years ago. This has meant great progress not only for  the business community but also for the consumers in eastern  Germany: Today any consumer can buy virtually everything he  wants in his immediate neighborhood.    The Federal Government is firmly determined to continue its  policy of promoting large-scale investment at a high level.  This is a really promising course for effectively supporting  the emergence of new, competitive economic structures and jobs  in eastern Germany.    One example that I would like to mention in this connection  is the investment grant, which we created, or the billions in  credits we granted for the founding of companies and  investments. Regarding public orders, we have introduced  preferential treatment to enterprises from eastern Germany. The  Federal Government, meanwhile, is places a fair share of its  orders in eastern Germany.    Of course, there are still many difficulties, which you  experience daily in your personal vicinity: Necessary changes  sometimes progress slowly and in some cases these are still  obstacles with which to contend. We must not close our eyes to  the fact that 40 years of division have left deeper traces than  we assumed. This simply cannot be undone with a few  declarations. Today I am more convinced than ever that the  decisive challenge as far as German unity is concerned is the  meeting between people, the coexistence between people in  Germany. Thus, I am asking all of you, all of us, wherever we  are, to do everything to make us talk with one another and not  about each other, so that those who have much to go through will  not forget that prosperity in the old FRG did not come overnight  but was the result of 40 years of hard work.    I also understand the working people who are worried about  the future of their jobs. This is why the Federal Government is  backing the necessary process of structural adaptation through  its active labor market policy. This is how millions of people  could be prevented from becoming unemployed in the next few  years. Behind these naked figures stand the fates of many  individuals and their families, who could be helped in this way.  Despite some criticism, I stand by this active labor market  policy as the expression of a real social market economy. After  all, German unity does not only mean introducing cold capitalism  in eastern Germany. What we want is a social market economy as  defined by Ludwig Erhard. It is true we are still losing old  jobs. Nevertheless, more and more we are able to replace these  with new, competitive jobs.    Ladies and Gentlemen: For many people in the new laender the  personal situation has improved. Since the introduction of  monetary, economic, and social union in May 1990, incomes of  private households in eastern Germany have almost doubled; last  year, they almost reached 70 percent of the western level. This  is an unprecedented process of catching up!    Regardless of all achievements we have made in the  reconstruction of the new laender, we must not ignore the fact  that in many areas there is still a lot of unsatisfied demand.    Of course, the large amounts of money we are investing  currently in the new laender will lead to the emergence of  blossoming regions in the new laender. There can be absolutely  no doubt about that, even though it might take a few years  longer than we originally thought. Yet, if this is the only  point in which I was wrong, then I can be quite content.    Despite all our efforts, we must recognize that first and  foremost the two sides of industry are shaping the opportunities  and prospects for work and employment. It is up to you and your  decisions to give real priority to employment and jobs. This  does not only apply to the new laender but to all of Germany.    I expressly welcome the fact that both sides of industry  have  recently shown readiness to be flexible. The first wage  agreement for 1994, which has now been achieved in the western  German chemical industry, has had an impact on public service,  by the way. This agreement gave priority to the objective of  jobs, which is good.    One thing I would like to emphasize is the agreement on  flexible working hours of 35 to 40 hours a week. Also of  particular importance are the special agreements for people  entering professional life or for the long-term unemployed.    For the first time, industry and labor have reached concrete  agreements that take into consideration differing efficiency and  thus are making it easier for enterprises to hire new people.    I think that the agreement in the chemical industry  contributes to the creation of more jobs, and should serve as a  model for others industries, too. In practical terms, this is  solidarity shown by those who have a job for those who are  finding it difficult to find one.    Flexible working hours can help extend machine running times  and create more part-time jobs. Now it will finally be possible  to increase the offer of part-time jobs. In other  industrialized nations this has been common practice for a long  time. In the Netherlands, for example, almost one out of every  three people employed works part time. Labor exchanges for  part-time jobs have even become an independent branch there.    Surveys have shown that in our country interest in part-time  jobs is much greater than what is being offered. Industry and  labor should take into consideration more strongly than in the  past that part-time work offers a major potential for more  employment in Germany.  <H6>  II. </H6>   Ladies and Gentlemen, I have mentioned this example since  today priority has to be given to preserving jobs and to  creating new jobs in the whole of Germany. Particularly in the  old laender structural weaknesses in the economy and the society  have accumulated in the course of the past few years. These  problems have nothing to do with German unity.    Demographic developments the average number of years an  individual works have profound consequences in the long run, for  example, for the labor market and the social security systems.  Dramatic changes in the age structure of the German population  after the turn of the millennium already are beginning to show.  Today Germany has one of the lowest birthrates in the world.  In 2030, presumably every third person will be over 60 years  old. Considering today's 1.8 million serious nursing cases,  nursing-care insurance is increasingly urgent. Therefore, we  will push it through -- we will also push through that the  ancillary wage costs will not be increased.    In order to ensure Germany's competitiveness as a business  location for the future, we jointly have to do everything to  overcome these structural weaknesses. The securing of the  business location is not only the Federal Government's business;  both sides of industry, the enterprises, the social groups, and  every individual citizen are called upon to live up to their  responsibility for the future.    It is now time for us to do everything that is overdue. For  that purpose, familiar paths have to be abandoned. However, if  we really want to say yes to the future, we have to be able to  do what is necessary today and not to postpone it any longer.  This is particularly important because of changes in the world  economy. Competition has become stronger. However, this does  not mean we have deteriorated, only that others have improved.  This applies not only to the Asiatic regions of growth, but  also to all countries of Central, East, and southeastern Europe.  After all, we want democracy and market economics to be  introduced there and these countries to recover again. However,  if they are successful, they will also become competitors. We  have to be prepared for this.    Last year, the Federal Government made several, also  unpopular decisions for the securing of our future. Property  cuts were unavoidable, claims had to be pushed back. However,  only in this way can we preserve the bases of our social  security in the long run.    But for me one field has to be excluded: pensions. Pensions  are not a charitable gift of the state. People have worked for  them their whole life. Therefore, we were not only guided by  economic considerations when we decided to take over pensions  for older people in the new laender. We owe special solidarity  to the generation of the people who are today 60 or 70 years  old. These people primarily carried the burden of the war and  were cheated out of better living conditions in the GDR.    As you know, the topic of savings also includes combating  social services abuses. Here, the campaign initiated by the  Federal Employment Office, the trade unions, and employers last  spring has been impressively successful. The number of cases of  abuse of services and illegal employment being investigated by  the employment offices increased by almost 50 percent. In this  way, by the end of November, a savings of almost DM1.2 billion  was achieved. This shows that there was and still is a burning  need for action. And this equally applies to tax evasion and  subsidy fraud.    Ladies and Gentlemen, regarding savings and the combating of  abuse, social cuts are not at issue, as some claim. A change in  the people's way of thinking, reshuffles, and reorientation are  required. Because of the enormous expenses for the new laender,  we now have the opportunity to advance the development speedily.  However, this also took the public budget to the limit of its  capacity.    Yesterday and the day before yesterday the Federal  Government  and the coalition resolved two things: On the one hand, we  agreed on specific, additional savings of DM5 billion in the  budget. I need not explain that this was not easy after about  DM21 billion had already been saved in the 1994 Federal Budget.  In this way, we wish to stress that the stability of state  finances is unrenounceable for us. For me stability also means  the inflation rate will go down further; I regard it an enormous  success that last year we achieved for the first time a rate in  the 3-percent range -- here I am also particularly grateful to  the Bundesbank.    On the other hand, yesterday we agreed on an "action program  for more growth and employment." I refrain from explaining the  measures to you in detail; those of you who have not yet read it  will certainly do so some time.    From my point of view, the intention of the Federal  Government to continue its deregulation policy with the  objective of shortening the planning and authorization process  in Germany is particularly important.    This program is apt to accelerate the economic recovery  which  is becoming noticeable and, at the same time, permanently  improve the conditions of Germany as a business location. It  relieves the enterprises and facilitates the securing and  creation of jobs.    With this action program, we also are implementing essential  measures we announced last September at the time of our report  on securing the future of Germany as a business location.    Notwithstanding the election year, these decisions are  absolutely necessary for securing the future. I have always  said we must not lose any time in securing jobs in Germany. For  me, the postponement of such important measures for the future  is not possible because, in this way, we would betray our future.    We already implemented a large part of the measures  contained in last lyear's report on Germany as a business  location. I would like to mention the following  examples:     -  The law on facilitating investment and land for  housing construction and the law on facilitating planning are  making the planning and authorization processes, which were  often too long and complicated before, far easier. I  immediately add the following: Far more could be done here.  However, for this we above all need the cooperation of the  laender, because they determine public administration in the  federal system.    -  After a long struggle, the amendment to the  genetic technology law has been achieved. This has also cleared  the way for the idea that research and innovation again have  priority -- without exceeding the limit of what is morally  permitted.    -  Because of the railroad reform, the way is cleared  for the reorganization of the railroads into a modern  transportation system under entrepreneurial leadership. In this  way, we have atoned for the omissions of the past 25 years.    We are firmly determined to make purposeful progress in  implementing during the current legislative period additional  pending measures recommended in the Report on Safeguarding  Germany as an Industrial Location in the Future. This includes  conclusion of the postal reform, in order to strengthen our  competitive position in the telecommunications markets, which  are growing with enormous speed all over the world.    The public response to our Report on Safeguarding Germany as  an Industrial Location in the Future is more than encouraging.  It shows that we have tackled a central topic for labor and  employment.    Ladies and Gentlemen, essential preconditions for  safeguarding the competitiveness of German industry are  future-oriented private investments and successful enterprise  strategies. In addition to reducing production costs, it is the  task of the companies to help new products gain a breakthrough  and develop new markets.    We Germans are international leaders in environmental  technology and in the development of new materials. What is  possible in these areas can also be achieved in other fields  that are important for the future.    However, in this we must always keep in mind that not  everything that is technically and scientifically feasible is  also ethically and morally permitted. The same goes for the  relationship between economy and ecology.    However, Ladies and Gentlemen, a country like ours also  needs  a climate that is friendly for technology. Creating this  atmosphere is one of the important tasks in educating the young  generation. In particular, we must once again impart to  students the feeling that technological top achievements are  something that we can be proud of -- just as athletic top  achievements naturally fill us with pride. Therefore, here, too,  we need to cultivate the elites.  <H6>  III. </H6>   Ladies and Gentlemen, responsibility for one's own actions,  courage for entrepreneurial risks, and readiness for innovation  -- all these are qualities which characterize the independent  medium-sized industries in our country -- are also needed in  other spheres of our society.    I am confident that together we will master the challenges  we  are facing. We must recognize the signs of the time; we must  open up new leeway for action for our country. This is also a  precondition for enabling us to make use of new opportunities we  will face in the future. The new international changes offer  excellent opportunities in particular to us Germans.    The recently achieved conclusion of GATT is of outstanding  importance for us. It is the most comprehensive liberalization  package of past decades. Without liberalization of  international trade relations, a country like the FRG that is so  strongly integrated into international economy, would be hit in  its vital nerve center.    This month the second stage of economic and monetary union  came into effect. As a result, Europe continues to grow  together in terms of economic and financial policy. About 70  percent of our products go the countries of the European  Community and EFTA -- this is a strong argument in favor of the  emerging Europe. Our economic future is most closely linked  with the process of European integration.    The decision to name Frankfurt/Main the seat of the European  Monetary Institute, and thus of the future European Central  Bank, is convincing proof of trust in us Germans. At the same  time, this decision is an important symbol of the fact that a  future European currency must be as stable as the German mark.    Ladies and Gentlemen, what is of concern to me at the moment  is, however, something else. There is a widespread view that,  after all the things that have happened, war has been banished  from our region forever. This is what people also thought in  the 1920's when Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann received  the Nobel Prize as the architects of the new peace. Evening  after evening I see the horrible pictures from the former  Yugoslavia, where people, who have lived together for  generations, are attacking each other. There are also worrying  reports from the area of the former Soviet Union. There some  people once again think that borders can be shifted by force.    If we want to overcome borders, we must bring people  together. I give you an example from my homeland, the  Palatinate. There, Palatines and Alsatians live together as  Germans and French and Europeans. This is what Thomas Mann said  a long time ago: We are German Europeans and European Germans.    We want Europe to be our protection and shield for the  future. Therefore, we must understand this development as an  opportunity; this also is particularly true for German  unification. Here I categorically oppose the stupid pessimism  that is currently spreading. We must overcome it and make use  of our opportunities. We must act with courage and  determination, with those principles and virtues that have made  our country great, with humaneness, loyalty, industriousness,  and reliability.    Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to cordially invite you  to  follow this path together with us, to understand it together  with us, and to act accordingly.

headline:    Solana Urges Extending Sarajevo Initiative 
text:  Language:   Spanish   Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Here in Spain the government monitored  developments in the crisis via the cabinet established at the  Moncloa Palace. When it was known that NATO's decision was not  to attack at present because the Serbs were meeting the  conditions of the ultimatum, Foreign Minister Javier Solana  expressed the government's wish for the terms of this ultimatum  to be applied and extended to the other cities of Bosnia. Valle  Alonso:    [Alonso] In statements to Radio Nacional early this morning  Foreign Minister Javier Solana ruled out air strikes in  Sarajevo. Solana made these statements at the Moncloa [Palace],  where he, the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the  defense minister, and the minister of the prime minister's  office had been since 1900. Javier Solana, who was in constant  telephone contact with his counterparts from the European Union  and Spanish diplomats and Spanish military commanders in the  former Yugoslavia, said that the NATO operation remains open and  the Spanish contingent is well.    [Begin Solana recording] The whole operation remains open  and  remains ready to be put into effect if necessary. What I can  tell you is, I stress again, that the situation on the ground is  developing favorably, positively. The deadlines of the  conditions of the ultimatum are being met. And I will emphasize  once again that our forces and the Spaniards on the ground are  well. [end recording]    [Alonso] Solana indicated that the Western European Union  [as  heard] is in favor of the initiative started in Sarajevo being  extended to other besieged enclaves such as Mostar. According  to the foreign minister, this stance is supported in full by the  Spanish government.    [Begin Solana recording] It is the wish of the Spanish  government, in collaboration with the European Union, to try to  use this initiative which has been started to liberate Sarajevo  to give a new impetus to the peace negotiations, which should  spread to the whole territory of Yugoslavia. I can tell you  that some initiatives are already underway. Yesterday and today  we, many of the European ministers, were in touch with our  Russian, Canadian and U.S. counterparts to try to put forward a  new peace initiative as soon as possible. [end recording]    [Alonso] The foreign minister emphasized that yesterday the  government kept in touch with the different parliamentary groups  so that they could have the most detailed possible information  on the latest developments.

text:  Language:   Hebrew   Article Type:BFN     [Report from Spain by political correspondent Shlomo Raz]     [Excerpt] We have heard the prime minister's initial  reaction to the assassination attempt against President Mubarak.  The question in this context is whether an attempt of this kind  will unsettle the relations between Israel and the Arab world,  and most notably those between Israel and Egypt. Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks reflect his emphatic endorsement of the  Israeli-Egyptian relations:    [Begin Rabin recording] I believe in the strength of  Mubarak's regime. I believe the majority of the people support  him. Yet there are radical elements, a phenomenon  characteristic in many Arab countries in which terrorism is not  repudiated. We have learned that terrorism is an integral part  of the essence of many Arab countries, and it is not exclusive  to the Palestinian, Lebanese, or Israeli context. The peace  process must be pursued despite the difficulties, of which we  are aware. As for peace in Egypt, I believe in the fortitude of  Mubarak's regime in that country. [end recording]    This was Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's first public  reaction  to the news of the assassination attempt against President  Mubarak. The issue of terror, to which Mr. Rabin referred,  constituted a considerable part of his conversation with Prime  Minister Felipe Gonzalez. The two men discussed Islamic  fundamentalism in Iran, among Palestinians, in Sudan, Lebanon,  and in countries closer to Spain, such as Algeria.    It was disclosed in Prime Minister Rabin's meeting with  Gonzalez that Spain will assist Israel's efforts to advance its  ties with the Arab world. It should be stressed that Spain has  very good relations with many Arab countries in North Africa,  the Persian Gulf, and particularly monarchic regimes. Prime  Minister Gonzalez prefers to work quietly and not to advertise  the Spanish efforts, but he promised to advance Israel's  interests in Arab countries. [passage omitted]

headline:    Russian General on Leningrad Military District 
text:  Language:   Finnish   Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colonel General V.M. Zhurbenko, deputy chief of the  general staff of the Russian Army, has been visiting Finland  this week. The colonel and his retinue have for several days  been following operations of the Finnish defense forces; they  have also visited the Mannerheim Museum. Matters concerning the  Leningrad military district, however, have not been discussed  during the visit. Jaakko Lensu reporting.    [Begin recording] [Lensu] Col. Gen. Zhurbenko says that the  manpower of the Leningrad military district is no secret, but...    [Zhurbenko in Russian followed by interpreter in Finnish]  The  figures are changing every day. Not even the chief of staff of  the Leningrad military district, who is present here, can say  what the daily situation is.    [Lensu] According to Zhurbenko, information is exchanged  constantly with the Finnish Defense Ministry. From 1986 the  number of troops in the Leningrad military district has  decreased one and a half times, according to Zhurbenko, and by  the end of next year the troops will decrease further.  Lieutenant General Sokolov, chief of staff of the Leningrad  military district, notes for his part that Finland has not even  asked about this.    [Sokolov in Russian interspersed by the voice of the  interpreter in Finnish] The representatives of the leadership of  the Finnish defense forces have not asked any questions about  this during our visit, because they already know everything they  want to know about this matter.    [Lensu] The host of Zhurbenko's visit, Lieutenant General  Matti Kopra, says for his part:    [Kopra] The Finnish defense forces have received the same  information that, according to the Vienna agreement, is given  each year in the CSCE report; and the latest information has  just arrived a little while ago. An entirely different matter  is the disarmament and reduction questions connected with cuts  in conventional forces, where Finland does not take part. And  there, as far as we have understood, Russia has a problem in the  sense that they are of the opinion that they are too much  bothered by these flank questions. What their stance is on that  and how they are going to find a solution to that is their  business, which has nothing to do with us.    [Lensu] A couple of days ago Admiral Jan Klenberg, the  commander of the defense forces, spoke about Finland's security  and noted that the treaty limiting conventional forces, that is  the CFE [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] Treaty, has  arrived at an interesting stage. According to Adm. Klenberg, it  looks like the implementation of the regional flank rules  concerning the areas near Finland were in danger. The  leadership of the Russian Armed Forces have for a long time  wanted to transfer extra troops to the southern flank, to the  area of Caucasian unrest. The limits of the CFE Treaty stop the  transfer of extra tanks, which are necessary according to the  Armed Forces, to this southern flank. This has made the  leadership of the Russian Army demand changes in these  paragraphs of the CFE Treaty, which were signed by NATO and the  Warsaw Pact countries at the time. Whether this plan is  implemented is another matter. To get an answer to this problem  might not be so important because, as heard, the guests were not  asked anything about this. Apparently, with this unsolved  problem, it is easier to justify the Finnish defense forces'  need for money. [end recording]

headline:    Finland Suspicious of Norway's Stance in EU Talks 
text:  Language:   Norwegian   Article Type:BFN     [Aslak Bonde report: "Finnish EU Doubts About Norway"]     [Text] There is growing distrust between Norway and  Finland over the agricultural issues in the EU [European Union]  negotiations.    Who is letting down whom? This question is being asked  increasingly often at present, a week and a half before the  planned completion of the EU negotiations. Rumors are rife, and  many are to do with the Finns' and the Norwegians' real motives  and demands with regard to agriculture.    In Finnish negotiating circles the view is that Norway is  not  battling particularly hard to achieve success on the most  important issue: What sort of permanent support arrangements  will be agreed for northern agriculture? There is also a  feeling that Norway has begun too early to talk about  compromises when it comes to transitional arrangements.    The Norwegians have long been afraid that the Finns will  forget their demand for reasonable transitional arrangements if  they only succeed in achieving good permanent support  arrangements. It is being said that as the result of a Finnish  initiative the European Commission is now working to find  alternatives to transitional arrangements for the food industry.  These include investment support, debt rescheduling, and  regional support.    AFTENPOSTEN has been unable to confirm the truth of any of  these rumors, but they are nevertheless interesting because they  show the fragility of Nordic cohesion.    There are also a number of obvious reasons for why the  rumors  have arisen. At last week's negotiating meeting the Norwegian  trade minister opted for a strategy different from that of her  colleagues from the three other applicant countries. She  pointed to the fact that on the question of transitional  arrangements for agriculture the EU has kept the door ajar for  Norway.    However, since then only very few have seen the gap in the  door that Grete Knudsen saw. Most people think that the EU  stood completely firm on its original demand that EU prices  should be introduced on the day that Norway becomes a member.    Outsiders took the Norwegian attitude to be that Norway  accepts the introduction of EU prices from day one if it is  possible to make exceptions for those farmers and that section  of the food industry that simply cannot cope with such a rapid  transition to the EU market.    According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, this is to read too  much into things. It is true that Norway has agreed to  investigate the need for transitional arrangements for every  individual product in the agricultural sector, but this  investigation will show that we need protection in the vast  majority of cases. Thus Norway is standing firm on the central  principle -- of achieving a type of transitional arrangement  different from those the EU has proposed.    As far as permanent support arrangements are concerned,  there  is an obvious reason why Finland is suspicious of Norway's  determination to stand firm: At present the EU is working with  an arrangement that suits Norway much better than it suits  Finland. A proposal for criteria that will determine new  support arrangements has been drafted which, in crude terms,  will mean that northern Norway, Trondelag, and the northernmost  part of southern Norway can receive special support. The same  criteria only provide a base for support for 3 percent of  Finnish agriculture.    The Finns therefore have major problems with accepting these  criteria as a point of departure for the negotiations. In  Norway the attitude is that with a few minor adjustments to the  EU's criteria it will also be possible to cover important areas  of southern Norway.    Norwegian negotiators are therefore attaching importance to  the fact that the EU is now actually prepared to create support  arrangements that are specially designed for the farmers in the  north. This was not the case from the beginning.

headline:    EU Views of Norwegian Membership Examined 
text:  Language:   Norwegian   Article Type:BFN     [Commentary by Geir Salvesen: "How Welcome Are We Really in   the EU?"]    [Text] Norwegians have a tiresome tendency to exaggerate  their own importance. When a Norwegian play is produced in  London, or when an item about Norway is shown on U.S.  television, many people believe -- with the help of the press --  that we have "conquered London" or that now the whole of the  United States knows about Norway.    We can also see traces of these distortions in the debate on  EU [European Union] membership. And here the yes camp and the  no camp are as bad as each other. Among some yes voters there  is a deep-rooted belief that Europe loves Norway and that there  is hardly anything more that it wants than to have bright and  shiny Norwegian values introduced into European cooperation.  Among some no voters there is a widespread view that the  Europeans love Norway because they will be able to rob us of  fish, oil, and democratic values.    The truth is -- as it usually is -- considerably more  complex. Officially Norway is being welcomed as an EU member.  The enthusiasm, however, is not as great as many Norwegians  believe. In addition, the reaction from some countries is more  reminiscent of a cold, or, at best, indifferent shoulder. This  is something that it is important to bear in mind in the final  phase of the negotiations that we are now entering.    So, is it simply a case of empty words when Norwegian  ministers on their frequent trips abroad to the EU capitals  receive kind assurances that people take a positive view of  Norway? No. In general there is a basically positive approach  behind these assurances, which may of course also be sweetened  by the necessary diplomatic phrases that are exchanged on such  occasions. But if you go behind the facade and talk to people a  little further down the ladder in the EU countries, it becomes  easier to catch sight of a more complex view.    "Norway is welcome, but not at any price." This is a view  that is expressed relatively often. This is another:    "Remember that it is Norway that is applying for membership  of the EU, and not the other way round."    Treating the EU as a "bloc" -- as so often happens in the  Norwegian debate -- is a hopeless and misleading point of  departure when trying to understand the relationship between the  EU and the applicant countries. All nation-states have their  individual economic and geopolitical interests that are promoted  with the greatest energy.    To the extent that it is possible to talk of deeper shared  attitudes among the EU countries they are to do, for example,  with the way they view the Norwegians. According to this  "mythology," the Norwegians will be among the best when it comes  to complying with decisions reached by the EU -- once they have  been reached. However, before the decisions are reached people  expect that Norway will cause trouble over points that are  viewed as peripheral in Europe. The Norwegians will also want  everything in writing, guarantees in minute detail. This will  create a clash of cultures.    In the negotiations themselves the view is now being taken  that all the Nordic applicant nations are as bad as each other.  But in general the picture abroad is that the Nordic countries  share "social democratic" values and ways of thinking -- a fair  distribution of wealth, social equality, and an interest in  environmental protection.    Let us look at the interests of the various countries in  the EU in relation to the three Nordic applicants.     -  Germany is perhaps Norway's main ally among the larger  countries. Unlike in 1972, Germany is prepared to go a long way  in order to bring in Norway and the other Nordic countries.  This is undoubtedly for geopolitical reasons -- so that the  northern part of the EU will be strengthened. It also has  something to do with economic, social, and cultural  ties.    -  Britain is also basically positively disposed toward  Norway and the Nordic area. For geopolitical, cultural, and  historical reasons. Also, however, because it takes the view  that Norway could help to slow down the federalist tendencies  and keep the Union in check.    -  France is relatively indifferent,  despite the fine words to Norwegian visitors. France is always  conscious of its power and historic role, and a brace of  quarrelsome Nordic countries could only help to water down the  solid power France also enjoys within the EU.    -  Italy -- the  weakened power to the south -- is basically positively disposed  toward expansion to the north, in part because it believes that  the diversity within the EU will be strengthened. But Austria is  more interesting from Italy's viewpoint. It does not like the  talk of a northern bloc that it fears would form an alliance  against the interests of the south. However, it is worth noting  that Italy has not gotten together with Spain to extract more  contributions and regional support and in this way put a spoke  in the wheels of enlargement.    -  Spain, Portugal, Greece. This  axis of the countries on the southern flank sees a chance of  getting more money out of the new applicant nations. For  example, Norway will be a net contributor to the common purse.  All these countries have fears about a shift in the center of  political gravity of the EC toward the north. The EU  presidency, held by Greece this spring, will have the effect of  imposing some discipline on possible extreme solutions proposed  by Greece in the final phase of the negotiations. The problem  lies with the Spaniards who in this enlargement round will try  to make up for what they did not get when they joined the EU a  few years ago.    -  The Benelux countries do not have a central role  to play and do not look as if they have any strong views apart  from a general goodwill -- and a position that makes them the  mediators between north and south. In other respects the  Netherlands' view of society is closest to that of the Nordic  countries.

text:  Language:   Greek   Article Type:BFN     [Report by Fanos Konstandinidhis]     [Excerpts] President Glavkos Kliridhis will begin briefing  the political leaders tomorrow on what has been discussed during  the confidence-building measures [CBM's] proximity talks, where  no progress has been made whatsoever.    The reason is because Rauf Denktas rejected President  Kliridhis' proposal on setting up a schedule for the return of  all the residents to the fenced-off part of Famagusta in  conjunction with the reopening of the Nicosia Airport and for  safe access from and to Famagusta. The Kliridhis proposal  includes the withdrawal of the occupation troops to the east of  the Dherinia Road so that there will not be any danger of  enclaving the Varosha residents. [passage omitted]    A senior government source told I MAKHI yesterday that at  the  next session of the talks President Kliridhis will reiterate the  same positions about Famagusta, Nicosia Airport, and safe access  to the fenced-off area of Famagusta. The same source added that  these issues are of substantial importance to the Greek Cypriot  side. This is why there is not going to be any retreat, the  source stressed.    The same source also noted that the Greek Government has  been  fully briefed on the results of the first phase of the talks.  President Kliridhis, the source added, will convene a meeting of  the National Council after the second phase of the talks is  concluded at the end of February.    At any rate, the Cyprus Government and the political leaders  in general do not expect any "spectacular" developments in the  new phase of the talks either. What is expected to happen after  Rauf Denktas' return from Ankara -- where he will go tomorrow  and return on Wednesday -- is that he will make some new  maneuvers and then again block the course of discussion by  reiterating the same positions, particularly on Famagusta, which  is the key to developments.    At the same time, backstage diplomats, particularly the  British and Americans, have begun again to move actively in an  attempt to overcome the deadlock. Their efforts will also be  focused on Ankara on the occasion of the Turkish Cypriot leaders  visit there. To break the deadlock, U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia  Richard Boucher and British High Commissioner David Dain  received instructions to begin intensive consultations with the  two sides. It is also rumored that U.S. Special Cyprus  Coordinator Robert Lamb will be coming to Nicosia during these  days to assist in the consultations.    The purpose of the new diplomatic moves is to attempt, in  the  event that it is impossible to end the deadlock, to find a  formula on the basis of which Mr. Kliridhis and Mr. Denktas will  meet with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in New York for  two-three days to hold a "general" discussion. On the basis of  this formula, the British and Americans hope that the proximity  talks, of which they are "sponsors," will continue.    At any rate, the experiment of the proximity talks and the  CBM's seems to be failing. [passage omitted]

Mr. Mikhailidhis will  hold talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel and other  members of the government. The main topics of the talks will be  the latest developments in the Cyprus issue and Cyprus'  application for accession to the European Union. Mr.  Mikhailidhis will also meet with former German foreign minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher.

Responding to a question on whether the United Nations will  submit new ideas in the next phase of the talks, Mr.  Mikhailidhis said: As is natural, after experiencing two  meetings at which there was substantive disagreement on the  critical issues, the UN Secretary General's representatives will  seek ways to put the entire process in motion and it is possible  that they will proceed with recommendations and advice  addressing these issues.

text:  Language:   Greek   Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed a  message of peace and a crystal clear warning in every direction  from Ioannina, where he spoke at the official luncheon hosted in  his honor by 8th Army Division commander Major General Andonios  (Nialamangas). Mr. Papoulias said: We really live in a period  that is fraught with immense dangers from the plunging of the  Balkans into a series of wild civil wars. The involvement of  foreign forces in these clashes and the impending bombing of  Bosnia-Herzegovina constitute a deadly threat to world peace.    Mr. Papoulias added: The war flames are burning in our  neighborhood, where unprecedented instability and uncertainty  prevail. Our homeland constitutes the only oasis of stability  in this sensitive region. With a steadfast peace-loving  orientation, Greece extends a hand to all its neighbors seeking  relations of friendship and cooperation. We do not claim  anything from anyone. The only thing we demand is respect for  our borders, respect of our fellow nationals' rights, and  respect of our history.    The foreign minister further said: Unfortunately, certain  quarters have interpreted this stance as weakness and began and  are still continuing with provocations and claims against our  country. The more we assert our stance on the question of peace,  the more determined we are to defend our history, our emblems,  and national heritage.    Mr. Papoulias also noted: We would like to send a message  from here in Ioannina to our friends and partners: It is not  Greece who is harming European Union [EU] solidarity; it has  already been injured by all those who support the intransigence  of [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia President Kiro]  Gligorov and tolerate his indescribable claims. It is our  homeland's inalienable right to protect our national integrity  by adopting all those measures that will ensure that our rights  are respected. Greece, far from harboring hegemonic intentions,  wants the Balkans to become a place of sincere cooperation and  mutual respect by all the peoples who live in this [words  indistinct] peninsula. We cherish the hope that this prospect  will prevail in the end over the disastrous logic of violence  and war. We are certain that many of those who now criticize us  will finally recognize the righteousness of our policy and our  devotion to peace.    Mr. Papoulias concluded: The Greek Armed Forces, with their  excellent morale, all-round training, and devotion to their  professional duty, constitute the most stalwart basis of this  peace-loving policy of our government.

text:  Language:   Greek   Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Government is determined to apply the measures  against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM], and the imposition of new measures is not  ruled out if [FYROM President] Mr. Gligorov continues to ignore  the conditions set by the Greek side.    Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert today reiterated  support for the Government on national issues. Our correspondent  Fotis Kafarakis has the following report:    [Begin recording] [Kafarakis] Despite the pressure being  exercised by various sides, the Government's decision to place  an economic blockade on Skopje remains firm. Moreover, it is  not ruled out that new measures will be imposed if the leaders  of the neighboring statelet continue to reject the three Greek  conditions for resumption of the dialogue under UN auspices.    New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert made a statement in  Preveza reiterating that Greece does not accept threats. Hands  off hellenism and respect for Greece was the message that Mr.  Evert sent in all directions.    Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, speaking in  Iraklion,  talked about the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement]  government following a different national strategy on the Skopje  issue than past governments.    [Tsokhatzopoulos] It struggles to change things, it  struggles  to succeed where others accepted conciliation and betrayal in  the past.

The source said the six ambassadors or representatives of  London, Paris, Bonn, Rome, The Hague and Copenhagen, had jointly  called on Greece to drop its action against the former Yugoslav  republic during a meeting Friday night with the secretary  general of the Foreign Ministry, Khristos Zakharakis.    It said the ambassadors had conveyed their countries'  concern  over the measures adopted last Wednesday.    The six countries concerned had all forged diplomatic  relations with Skopje last December, before Greece took over the  rotating presidency of the EC, much to Athens' disgruntlement.    While Greece has been asked to explain its decision to a  meeting of the 12 EC foreign ministers in Brussels Monday,  Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis declared Saturday  night that the blockade would remain in force until Macedonia  backed down.    Greece accuses Macedonia of usurping the name which it  maintains is historically Greek and of harbouring expansionist  aims towards the Greek province of that name.    It has called on Skopje to renounce what it said was hostile  propoganda and drop the star of Vergina from its flag, a symbol  of the Macedonian dynasty in ancient times.    Athens is refusing to allow oil and other essential supplies  through its northern port of Salonika, saying this is the only  way to bring pressure to bear on Skopje to bow to Greek demands.

Government sources reached this  conclusion based on Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's  talks in Athens. This conclusion is also strengthened by  information from Belgrade, according to which the Russian  Government has a broader plan to settle all the aspects of the  Yugoslav crisis. The ease with which Russia achieved the  lifting of the deadlock in Bosnia-Herzegovina confirms this fact.    The moderation with which Skopje has so far dealt with the  Greek partial economic embargo reinforces the view that Russia  has undertaken a behind-the-scenes diplomatic activity.    We must not let the fact that large European countries such  as Germany, which only reacted "lukewarmly" to the Greek  Government decision, pass unnoticed.

headline:    Cetin Cautions Against Optimism Over Bosnia 
text:  Language:   Turkish   Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the  goal in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not to launch an air raid at all  costs, but to end the siege on Sarajevo. He added that one  should not be very optimistic about the NATO announcement that  it does not deem it necessary to launch an air raid on the  Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina at this stage.    In an assessment to Turkish Radio and Television following  the NATO announcement that it does not deem it necessary to  launch an air raid on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin recalled that  the regions outside Sarajevo are also under siege by the Serbs.  Pointing out that NATO should take action on that issue as  well, Cetin said Turkey will take steps to achieve this end.    Noting that he discussed the NATO ultimatum by phone with  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Cetin said: Our goal is  not to launch an air raid at all costs. Our goal -- everyone's  goal -- was to end the siege on Sarajevo. Now, are we faced  with a delaying tactic or have physical conditions prevented it?  This will be clarified in the coming hours. In our view, what  is more important is that one should not view this development  too optimistically.    Cetin stated that if, in the aftermath of recent  developments, the Bosnian Muslims are attacked and cannot defend  themselves, then the world and NATO will be responsible for the  consequences. Cetin added: By not lifting the arms embargo on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the world, which bears moral responsibility  for all the tragedy that has been caused so far, will now be  directly responsible for what happens. I do not even want to  think that NATO will permit such a thing to happen at this  stage. I believe NATO will do what is necessary.    Cetin concluded by saying that the necessary pressure should  be applied to the Serbs and Croats to secure the just requests  of the Bosnians and that [words indistinct].

headline:    Parallels Drawn Between Abkhaz, Crimea Situations 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Commentary by Igor Rotar: "The Crimean Tatar Majlis Meets   Today. Is the Abkhaz Scenario Possible in Crimea?"]    [Text] The victory at the presidential elections of Yuriy  Meshkov and his confrontation with the Crimean Tatar movement,  which began immediately after this, are one further reminder  that the situations in the separatist formations that gravitate  toward Russia have much in common.    What do the situations in Crimea and Abkhazia have in  common?  The present situation in these two regions differs so much that  even the mere fact of a comparison of relatively prosperous  Crimea with semi-ravaged Abkhazia smacks at first sight of  blasphemy. But there are analogies, for all that.    Both in Crimea and in Abkhazia, the separatist movements  relied primarily on the "patriotic" forces of Russia. We would  recall that Zhirinovskiy collected a substantial number of the  signatures for his party's registration in Abkhazia. The  national patriots are quite popular in Crimea also. Thus, Sergey  Shuvaynikov, leader of the Russian Party of Crimea  (Zhirinovskiy's closest ally), amassed approximately 14 percent  of the vote at the presidential elections and came third among  the candidates. Although the present president of Crimea is more  guarded than his recent election rival, he is no stranger to  imperial ambitions either. It is notable that Shuvaynikov's  response during a television debate: "A great Russia, which  would include not only Ukraine and Belarus, but also the  Transcaucasus and Central Asia, could begin to be reconstituted  from Crimea," was supported by the present president of Crimea  also. And before the second round of voting, both the Russian  Party and the Crimean communists called for people who had cast  their votes for them to give them to Yuriy Meshkov.    But the solidarity of the leaders of the separatist  movements  with the Russian patriots has already become a commonplace. What  is far more interesting is something else--the similarity of the  processes in the two Black Sea republics. A new election law  providing for national quotas was passed in Abkhazia in 1991.  Thus the Abkhaz, who constitute approximately 17 percent of the  population, obtained 43 percent of the seats. The Abkhaz argued  the need for national quotas by the mass immigration in the 20th  century of the Georgian population onto the territory of  Abkhazia, which brought about an abrupt change in the ethnic  balance (in 1897 the Abkhaz had constituted more than 80 percent  of the population of the territory).    The parliament of the Crimean Tatars--the Majlis--also is  presenting a similar initiative. In the opinion of the leaders  of this organization, a bicameral parliament should be formed in  Crimea. One chamber, with the right of veto, should consist only  of the indigenous peoples of the Crimea--Tatars, Crimeans, and  Karaimy. Approximately 250,000 Crimean Tatars live in Crimea  today, which constitutes almost 10 percent of the population of  the peninsula. Approximately the same number of their fellow  tribesmen are forced, as before, to remain outside of their  historical homeland.    The election of Yuriy Meshkov--an opponent of privileges for  the indigenous people--as president of the peninsula could  transfer the thus far smoldering conflict to a new phase. We  would recall that at his first news conference, Yuriy Meshkov  declared that the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people should  register as a social and political organization, otherwise its  very existence would be illegal. The response was immediate:  "There can be no question of recognition of Meshkov as  president," Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Majlis, declared.  In the opinion of the leader of the Crimean Tatars, the demand  for registration of the Majlis is baseless and absurd. "Another  twist of the spiral of confrontation awaits us," Dzhemilev  concluded. The further course of events will depend not least on  the position in relation to the president of Crimea that will be  determined by the Majlis of Crimean Tatars which meets today and  on the reaction to its decisions of the new-fledged president.    But whereas the Abkhaz managed not only to occupy the key  positions in parliament but also to change in their favor the  ethnic balance in the republic, a similar victory by the  indigenous peoples in Crimea is unrealistic. A reason for the  victory of the Abkhaz is explained by the fact that Tbilisi's  ill-considered policy united practically the entire  nonindigenous population of the unrecognized republic (more than  50 percent of the population of Abkhazia). In addition, the  geographical location of the unilaterally abolished autonomy,  which is surrounded on all sides by kindred peoples, which did  not fail to come immediately to the assistance of their fellow  tribesmen, worked in favor of the Abkhaz movement. And, finally,  the most important point--the practically unconcealed assistance  to the supporters of separation from Georgia on the part of the  Russian Army.    Not a single one of the above-mentioned factors operates in  Crimea. The Crimean Tatars have found themselves in a minority,  having supported (as distinct from the vast majority of the  Russian-speaking population) Nikolay Bagrov, speaker of the  Crimean parliament, who aspires to "conflict-free" relations  with Kiev. The geographical isolation of the Crimean Tatars does  not allow them to look for sufficiently effective assistance  from kindred peoples. And, finally, the Black Sea Fleet, the  majority of whose officers, as Mustafa Dzhemilev maintains,  voted for Zhirinovskiy, would clearly not act on the side of  Ukraine.    I would like to emphasize that I by no means suspect the  leaders of the Crimean Tatar movement of an aspiration to  resolve the problem militarily (the Majlis is headed by quite  reasonable people). I have intentionally examined an obviously  utopian idea in order to show the impracticability of the  development of the Caucasus option in Crimea.    But it would hardly be appropriate to disregard the "Tatar  card" completely, for all that. There are in Ukraine many  organizations with an interest in an exacerbation of the  situation on the peninsula in order subsequently to attempt to  resolve it by the power method. Provoking a conflict is not that  difficult. The increasing confrontation between Yuriy Meshkov  and the Crimean Tatar movement is not the sole possible cause of  destabilization of the situation. Although today the Crimean  Tatars are not formally prevented from returning to the  peninsula, it is still hard to consider the problem resolved.  The quite complex political situation in the Central Asian  states (the main region of deportation of the Crimean Tatars)  and, as a consequence, the exodus of the Russian-speaking  population, have brought about a sharp drop in the value of  apartments in these states compared with the European part of  the former USSR. Whereas earlier the Crimean Tatar, having sold  his apartment in Central Asia, could with the money he made on  this easily have purchased the same type of accommodations  elsewhere, under the new conditions the money that he obtains is  frequently barely sufficient to cover his fare. In addition,  inflation has "eaten up" the savings accumulated over the years  by the Crimean Tatars for their return home. There is today in  Crimea a multitude of temporary settlements (people often live  in adobe cottages, even): Having begun to build, the Crimean  Tatars cannot put together the money to complete the job. In  this situation, people could resolve upon spontaneous protests.  And although their scale would not, of course, be comparable  with those of the Abkhaz, they would not add tranquillity to the  peninsula.

text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Oleksandr Pilat: "Where Crimea Is `Drifting.'   Today Marks 40 Years Since the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium  Decided to Incorporate Crimea Oblast Into Ukraine"]    [Text] And it was not by chance. The USSR's top party  and state leadership saw how impoverished the peninsula was  getting, with not enough water and power, and the people's  wretched standard of living. The hard-working Crimean Tatar  nation was deported in 1944. Practically no one was left to till  the fields.    Ukraine brought the arid land back around. After the  North Crimean Canal was built, water from the Dnieper came to  the peninsula. Grape and grain crop yields increased greatly,  and a crop new to Crimea appeared--rice. Today 83.7 percent of  the Crimeans' water needs come from the Dnieper. Crimea provides  only 15 percent of its own electricity; the rest comes from  Ukraine. All of the peninsula's coal needs (1.65 million tonnes  yearly) and sugar are also supplied by Ukraine. Moreover, the  Republic of Crimea imports over twice the amount of consumer  goods than it exports.    These are the figures, these are the facts. Even the  most rabid Russian chauvinists cannot refute them.    Recently, especially since the election of President Yu.  Meshkov, who hews to a pronounced pro-Moscow orientation,  pro-Russian forces have done everything they can to belittle  Ukraine's role in the Crimea, indulging in all kinds of  falsifications and absurd fabrications. Typically, at Yu.  Meshkov's press conference that took place immediately after he  returned from a six-day trip to Moscow, he praised Russia to the  skies for "granting Crimea most-favored status." To be sure,  journalists never learned just whom Meshkov met and talked to,  though he did say it was on the top level--"only the Lord God is  higher." But what kind of summit could it be if Crimea's  President met with neither B. Yeltsin or V. Chernomyrdin?    The Crimean Tatars are skeptical to Meshkov's announcement  that Russia has appropriated 50 billion rubles to repatriate the  deported nation. Anyway, they don't believe it, because for long  years, despite endless talks, our neighbors have refused to help  this unfortunate nation in any way.    At the press conference, Yu. Meshkov said in particular:  "The  journalist's job is to report the news, not to express his own  point of view and urge people who support it to take part in  transmitting it." Local observers' fears that the new regime  might harass dissidents are proving true. In fact, the "first  fruits" are already apparent. On 6 February Borys Kyyashko, the  vice president of the Krym TV-Radio Company, took a 15-minute  Ukrainian TV broadcast off the air (it was supposed to air a few  hours after Meshkov's press conference). Incidentally, it was  just a few months ago that Viktor Khomenko (Ukrainian TV's  correspondent in the Republic of Crimea) literally begged Krym's  administration for those 15 minutes a week. Now, evidently, the  15 minutes are no more.    We have reported how the forces that brought Meshkov to  power  are hasseling Ukrainian journalists, and at rallies you hear  calls for immediate reprisals against the "khokhols"  ["topknots"; a pejorative Russian term for Ukrainians], calls  for firing and deporting journalists whose writings advocate the  idea of reviving the Ukrainian state and national dignity of  Ukrainians and Crimea's deported peoples. Well, there was a  deportation in Crimea once. I wonder who now will assume the  political roles of the comrades-in-arms of Stalin and Beriya?    Meanwhile, the local press is opposing possible Crimean  Tatar  statehood and a Medzhlis [muslim parliament] to serve as their  representative body of authority, on grounds that the Republic  of Crimea was restored on the territorial (?) principle and  supposedly was never created on the principle of nationality.  This is false. We know that the Crimean Autonomous Soviet  Socialist Republic existed while Crimean Tatars lived there. A  year after they were deported, the republic was converted to an  oblast. This is just one of many pieces of evidence that the  republic has the status of the Crimean Tatars'  national-territorial autonomy.    Sad to say, neither Ukraine's President nor its Supreme  Council are willing to see that the problem of the peninsula can  be solved only by recognizing the Crimean Tatar nation's  Medzhlis, and by granting that nation the right to territorial  self-determination in accordance with international practice.  Our country does not have the right (future generations will not  forgive us) to allow the long-suffering Crimean Tatar nation to  be an exile in its own land.

headline:    Crimea TV Head Refuses To Resign 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Olga Pronina: "The Crimean Republic: Astakhov   Was the First To Receive the Suggestion To Resign. Who Is Next?"]    [Text] The situation developing in the Crimea puts  the question to Kiev point-blank: What is to be done, since  television remains the last bridge linking Kiev and  Simferopol?    On 18 February the president of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov,  suggested that the president of the Krym [Crimea] Television and  Radio Company, Valeriy Astakhov, go into "voluntary-compulsory"  resignation, explaining this only by saying that it is unlikely  they can work together successfully. Although Yuriy  Aleksandrovich himself seems to have no complaints against  Valeriy Nikolayevich.    Maybe he does not, but then among those who do are some  people's deputies who hold positions in the RDK [expansion  unknown] and even the chairman of the fairly well known  association "Impeks-55 Krym", Valeriy Averkin himself, who  played a very effective role in shaping Yu. Meshkov as a  politician in the first stages of his giddy career. But today  Mr. Averkin, who has become involved in publishing activity, is  already trying to influence the shaping of public opinion among  all the Crimean petty bourgeoisie. In MESHCHANSKAYA GAZETA,  which he owns, V. Averkin on 16 February advised the government  how to "spank" the president of the television and radio  company, V. Astakhov, whom he has always disliked, you see, and  now, it is becoming clear, simply can no longer stand because of  the pro-Rukh spirit on the screen. "Crimea television," the  chief petty bourgeois of Crimea categorically alleges, "in its  present form is a slap in the face to Russian-speaking Crimeans,  regardless of their nationality... And it will be so until," V.  Averkin stresses, "Mr. Meshkov begins to fulfill his  pre-election promises, including those concerning television."    As is evident, he has already begun. But this "beginning"  immediately raised some questions. First, is it reasonable to  change the leader of the most popular and influential  information medium at the height of the pre-election campaign?  Secondly, how is it that the president of the teleradio company  of Crimea, which is a part of Gosteleradio Ukrainy [State  Television and Radio of Ukraine] and is financed from the state  budget, works under a contract with this organization which will  not terminate for 3 years? Thirdly, is putting the question in  that way proper when today there is no legal mechanism to allow  the president of Crimea to decide it on his own? The Supreme  Soviet now has the deciding word; I hope it will be guided not  by personal sympathies and antipathies, but by the norms of laws.    Valeriy Astakhov refused to accept Yuriy Meshkov's  suggestion  and intends to defend his rights in accordance with the law.    The Crimean branch of the Helsinki Civil Assembly was the  first to defend the rights of the journalist. The Assembly's  announcement says, among other things, that such a development  of events at the height of the election campaign for the  parliaments of Crimea and Ukraine opens up the way for political  censorship in Crimea and to the expulsion from television and  radio of journalists who have an independent opinion.    Out of fairness, I must say that it was precisely when V.  Astakhov became the head of the television and radio company  that it became possible to express various points of view,  including ones which differed from the official point of view.  With Astakhov's support, national editorial desks were set up  and are operating: Crimean-Tatar, Armenian, Greek, and  Bulgarian, plus the Si-Ay interethnic information service which  works in four languages, and the new channels. This enabled  television broadcasting to be increased from 6 hours a week to  36.    Even now the pressure of the Rossiya Bloc is appreciable; it  is not hiding its desire to obtain an absolute majority in the  Crimean parliament and realize its main task--to join the  peninsula to Russia. The arrival of a new leadership in  television will undoubtedly make this majority overwhelming. The  situation taking shape puts this question point-blank to  official Kiev too: Television in Crimea remains essentially the  last bridge linking Kiev and Simferopol, since the Ukrainian  newspapers have been reaching Crimea irregularly and very late  for a long time now. Incidentally, this is unlike the example of  the Russian newspapers, which appear in subscribers' boxes and  at kiosks on the day that the papers come out.

headline:    Party Leaders Denied TV Access 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Unattributed report under the rubric "Rescuing the   Drowning": "An Unprecedented Scandal on Ukrainian Television";  with separate commentary by Vitaliy Zhuravskiy, chairman of the  Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine: "Why the Christian  Democrats Left the Television Studio"]    [Text]  <H5>  An Unprecedented Scandal on Ukrainian Television </H5>   On Monday, 21 February, representatives of the Christian  Democratic Party (KhDPU) and the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists (KUN) gathered in the UT [Ukrainian Television]  studio in preparation for conducting a pre-election interparty  debate. But it did not take place; in voices shaking with  emotion and fear, the UT commentators began to read the  "instructional" letter from Tsentrizbirkom [Central Election  Commission], by which the parties' leaders (top people) were  prohibited from taking part in such debates (!?).    As a sign of protest, after making statements appropriate to  the moment, both party delegations left the television studio.  It was pitiful to watch the lonely moderators of the "television  debates" pressed close to one another and trying somehow to  "save face" for the completely and wholly compromised Ukrainian  (read "presidential") Television, which is mired in lies and  political censorship.    So the party leaders are prohibited from speaking on the  air.  But then at the most convenient times, in the best tradition of  the era of stagnation, the chairman of Gosteleradiokompaniya  (State Television and Radio Company), Nikolay Okhmakevich, a  candidate for deputy in two rayons of Zhitomir Oblast, was  allowed to film and "roll" short features of Ruzhin and  Popelnya, where he is registered.    It will be interesting to see how events develop further:  before last Monday UT had already offered the floor to a number  of party leaders. But now it is prohibited. Next Monday is the  next round of debates. We express our sincere condolences to our  colleagues who found themselves in the role of scapegoats.  <H5>  Why the Christian Democrats Left the Television Studio </H5>   In the opinion of the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine,  the directive read on the air is a flagrant legal offense. The  Christian Democrats consider it a case of settling accounts for  opposition to the "party in power." After all, preceding us, on  17 February, three parties, two of which are clearly  pro-presidential, were not refused permission to take part in an  hour-long television debate. In this way Ukrainian Television  violated Article 27 of the current Law: "From the time they are  registered by election commissions and receive certification,  candidates for deputy have an equal right to conduct an election  campaign: to appear at pre-election and other meetings, rallies,  parades, and sessions directly related to the election and on  the mass information media (in the press and on radio and  television)."    Six of our candidates for deputy were not allowed to  communicate with television viewers and acquaint them with the  pre-election platform of the KhDPU.    So on the basis of Article 18 of the Law of Ukraine "On  Elections of People's Deputies of Ukraine," we protest the  decision of the chairman of the Central Election Commission. And  we are submitting this protest to the Supreme Court of Ukraine.

headline:    Youth Conflict Potential Gauged 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Candidate of Philosophical Sciences Iryna   Bekeshkina and Candidate of Philosophical Sciences Viktor  Perebenesyuk, Ukrainian Scientific-Research Institute of Youth  Problems: "Conflict--Where Shall We Expect Trouble?"]    [Text] 1. Young people's social-conflict potential  and the basic spheres of conflict development    It shouldn't be necessary these days to argue how urgent the  problem of social conflicts is. You don't need to be a sociology  expert; all you have to do is live in this society to sense a  growing mass dissatisfaction, irritation and fatigue, an erosion  of values and loss of faith in the future. For at least a year  we have felt a foreboding of social disasters and catastrophes,  which makes it essential to study and forecast the development  of conflicts in society.    Of course, our research (the Scientific-Research Institute  of  Youth Problems Sociology Laboratory, in a representative  republic-wide sample, surveyed 1,475 respondents age 15 to 29 in  10 regions of Ukraine) cannot pretend to solve all the problems  of social conflicts, especially considering the almost complete  lack of conflictological traditions in the old Soviet  sociological literature. The authors' goal was not just to  analyze the conflict potential of young people, who are the most  active social group, and explore the basic spheres of future  conflict, but also to ascertain the extent to which the  conflicts that are typical of our society are similar to or  different from those of civilized democratic societies. This is  important in establishing our own national conflictological  theory.    Our society's crisis is reflected in young people's  dissatisfaction with nearly everything--their status in society,  material security, and life in general; these are reliable  indicators of social conflict. Some young people have adjusted  to the situation, but they are not very numerous. Only 27.3  percent are happy with their living conditions, 24.3 percent are  happy with the food situation, 13.2 percent are happy with  available clothing, 15.9 percent are happy with working  conditions, 12.5 percent are happy with recreation facilities,  9.8 percent are happy with medical services, 5.8 percent are  happy about the ecology, and 12.3 percent are happy about their  security. Only 9.8 percent are happy overall with living  conditions, while almost half--44.5 percent--are unhappy (the  remainder didn't have an unequivocal answer).    Another serious indicator of society's conflict potential is  the public's subjective "foreboding" of conflicts. One third of  our young respondents thought them possible in the near future,  another 12.5 percent think social disturbances could erupt in  Ukraine in a year, 13 percent think it could happen in two or  three years, 17.1 percent relegate that prospect to the far  future, and only 22.2 percent maintain that in principle it is  impossible here. Hence, there is a definite syndrome of  expectation of conflict in society.    Analyzing the concerns of today's youth and the problems  that  worry them most in the present crisis [Table 1], we conclude  that the main sphere of potential conflicts will be the economy,  the sphere of material concerns.    Problems of human rights, also the ecology, are quite  important. The "forcible Ukrainianization" that has been used  here and there to scare people, especially in traditionally  Russian-speaking areas, does not especially worry young people,  any more than a return to the communist past, which is obviously  unrealistic.    2. Subjects of conflicts and youth's readiness to take  part in protests    Who is the "face of the enemy," who personifies the main  cause of our troubles, and how strongly is it imprinted in the  mass consciousness? The mass media seem to have done everything  they can to shape that image. At first, right after the collapse  of the Soviet Union, it was the party apparatchik; then, after  the restoration of the Ukrainian state, it was the Russian (or  disguised local) chauvinist; now the national radicals are named  most often.    It is a rather specific factor that prompts the search for  "the enemy"--namely, the level of material security. It is those  who belong to the lowest level of prosperity and have limited  food who tend to blame certain social forces, in particular  those of a nationalist bent. National radicals are seen as the  enemy by 14.9 percent of those who have limited food and 14.9  percent of those who barely make it from payday to payday, but  only 4.7 percent of those who can afford anything they want.  Great-power chauvinists are blamed by 15.7 percent of persons in  the lowest material stratum but only by 6.3 percent of those in  the highest. Incompetent careerists in the government are blamed  by 37.2 percent in the lowest group and by 26.6 percent in the  highest. This is natural, because those who have adjusted to the  present difficult economic situation and have pulled themselves  up by their bootstraps tend more to rely on themselves, their  own efforts, and pay less attention those who are in power or  striving for it.    Still, representatives of all social, professional, and  property groups think that the main cause of potential conflicts  is not the schemes of enemies but difficult living conditions,  which are also the main cause of social tensions.    Young people's social dissatisfaction is reflected directly  in their assessment of all links of state  authority--legislative, executive, and judicial. The performance  of the presidential branch is assessed somewhat more positively.  Although representatives of the President were rated positively  by only 6.7 percent (versus negatively by 39.9 percent), the  President himself was rated positively by 14.5 percent and  negatively by 38.8 percent.    Hence, the basic subjects of present-day social conflict are  the public, on the one hand (in this case, young people), and  structures of authority, on the other.    Could mass dissatisfaction with the authorities, forebodings  of conflict, and a relatively high conflict potential really  turn into civil disobedience and political disturbances? The  well-known thesis of the particular radicalism of young people  and their readiness to engage in open conflict has not been  confirmed. It was found, in fact, that young people are even  less inclined than other age groups to engage in conflicts.  [Table 2]    3. Forecasting conflicts and problems of solving  them    Young people do not accept but rather condemn violent,  extremist forms of protest; they prefer lawful and moderate  means [Table 3]. We may predict that the chief kind of struggle  will take the form of economic strikes.    A greater tendency to use lawful forms of social protest was  shown by young people in Kiev, the Republic of Crimea, and the  Lvov and Transcarpathia regions, while violent methods are  favored by the young people of the Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Odessa,  and Kirovograd regions. Strikes are preferred primarily by those  in the worker professions, while more radical methods are  favored by younger persons who are not working or in  college--that is, today's older highschool students; among  social groups it is workers of various kinds, and owners.    Respondents were asked directly what factors might prompt  them to take part in active forms of protest. More than half of  them--54.4 percent--are not willing to do so under any  conditions. The scenarios were designed to be extreme ones--the  disappearance of basic food staples from store shelves,  inflation, poverty, rampant crime, and so on. Hence, along with  sharp deterioration of the situation in society we find a  substantial gap between expectations of conflict and  dissatisfaction with various aspects of social and economic life  today, on the one hand, and young people's readiness to protest  actively against these things, on the other.    For young people who can still conceive of factors that  might  prompt them to take part in acts of protest, the main one is the  impossibility of earning a decent living.    The best way to prevent youth's conflict potential from  turning into active forms of protest, in particular, is to carry  out economic reforms that will give young people the chance to  solve their most urgent problems--basically, material problems.  In our opinion, it is not social protection in the form of  miserly social assistance that ought to be the core of youth  policy, but instead, prompt reforms toward a market economy in  which young people, thanks to their greater mobility, energy,  and their ability to upgrade their skills and adjust to new  conditions, have a good chance of solving their problems on  their own.    A major role in averting social conflicts is played by young  people's enthusiasm (especially the younger set) for modern  arts, in particular movies and music. Unsound policies toward  mass culture can only worsen and stimulate social conflict.    One important element of a civilized mechanism of resolving  conflicts in developed democratic countries is a multi-party  system, where parties serve as intermediaries between the public  and the state authorities and express the interests of various  social groups and strata. The parties are the basic mechanism  for institutionalizing conflicts, moving them out of the sphere  of possible direct clashes and into parliament. Moreover,  parties enable groups to reconcile their interests with those of  society's, otherwise a party cannot win in general elections.    But besides the fact that our society has yet to form a real  multi-party system, this is hindered by young people's political  apathy (a trend that has been observed in recent years) and  their loss of faith in political parties. Only 3.5 percent of  young people now are members of youth associations, and only 1.6  percent belong to political parties. Moreover, 1.1 percent of  the respondents reported taking part in events put on in 1993 by  Ukraine's youth organizations, and another 2.7 percent took part  in a few.    We can see, then, that the existence of supposedly numerous  youth associations (both political and non-political--for  example, the MZhK [unidentified]), for all their apparent vigor,  actually involves a rather narrow segment of young people,  primarily the leadership apparatus of the organizations. They do  not enjoy much support from young people and do not arouse much  enthusiasm. Young people still prefer student organizations as  well as sport, tourist, and ecological groups. Political youth  associations rank in last place on this list, their members  numbering only 15.8 percent, and are outranked by religious  associations, which 24.1 percent of the respondents called  worthwhile. So in the event of conflict relations with the  authorities, today's youth associations are hardly likely to be  effective advocates of young people's interests.    As for the political parties, if the elections had been held  last year, only three political forces would have won over 5  percent--Rukh (5.2 percent), the Democratic Party of Ukraine  (5.8 percent), and the Greens (6.2 percent). Most of the young  people--74.3 percent--could not name their favorite party; 37.7  percent answered that they didn't know which party to vote for;  18.2 percent stated they would not vote for any of the parties,  on principle; and another 16.4 percent said they would vote for  the candidate, not the party.    This can bring it about that if it comes to a conflict, it  will not take place in institutionalized forms, where group  interests are represented by parties, trade unions, and civic  organizations, but in the form of disorderly actions enabling  political forces whose interests do not really coincide with  those of young people, to use them.    But if market reforms are carried out, conflict in society  will come more and more to resemble the classic form prevailing  in the developed Western countries, namely between rich and  poor. Yet it will not be in the nature of inter-class conflict;  rather, it will be manifested in pressure on the government by  the poorest segments of society to redistribute the social  product. A major problem of the conversion to the market will be  unemployment, which will be condemned by almost all social  groups except the owners. Unlike older groups, young people will  not be willing to live on social assistance or be content with  low-paying employment.

headline:    Commentary on Eastern Oblast Economic Autonomy 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Tetyana Khomych: "The Counselor of Rutskyy   Teaches Us To Live"]    [Text] Eastern Ukraine has succeeded in winning economic  independence from Kiev. As we know, Ukraine's President, in  response to the insistence of the oblast council officials and  executive authorities of four oblasts, recently signed an edict  granting regional self-government status to Dnepropetrovsk,  Donetsk, Zaporozhye, and Lugansk oblasts. To put it more  plainly, it is not yet a federative system. Politics abstracted,  the new division of Ukraine into the "potato west" and the "iron  east" is comparable to the story of the man who has a horse and  puts a high fence around his farm so that his relative who  doesn't have a horse won't be coming around to be jealous of his  prosperity.    There hasn't been much prosperity in the east yet, though,  and some might be inclined to predict that the isolation of the  technological and raw materials-rich region will make its life  harder--in which, as during the era of intensive industrial  exploitation of it to meet the needs of the former USSR  (especially metal needs), priority will go to the interests of  industry and its magnates rather than to the people.    The recent Russian media report of rolled metal sent from  Dnepropetrovsk to someone who doesn't need it in the Russian  boondocks is just one episode of this kind of "management."  Consuming the lion's share of costly energy imported from  Russia, local plants are hoarding goods for export or for  barter; and just as the ordinary local citizen got nothing from  that little contribution to the state budget, now again he'll  get the same from the contribution the regional authorities take  from Kiev. Certain officials' assurances that "the metal will  enable the region to supply itself with gasoline" are not making  many people optimistic. The opulent life of owners of official  cars running on fuel at state prices has long been a sore point.  Meanwhile, it doesn't solve others' problems.    This serves to confirm people's belief that the "economic  self-government" is beneficial only to the numerous corps of  local "party authorities," solving problems of ambition rather  than real ones. And although the authorities, as usual, answer  with annoyance that economic self-government has nothing to do  with territorial problems, the speech of officials in the  Dnieper region has been increasingly tinged with the accents of  Donetsians, who haven't concealed their intention to bring all  of eastern Ukraine into their sphere of influence. But as to who  wants to bring Donetsk into it there is no doubt.    A logical segment in this chain of events of Ukraine's new  economic reality is the invitation of a group of Russian  methodologists to Dnepropetrovsk to "formulate an optimal  conception of regional "life support." It is reported that the  group is headed by Yanovskyy, the eminent Russian economist and  former counselor of Rutskyy; the consultants also include a  number of champions from Yavlynskyy's team.    It should be added that the day before, the local press was  pushing the notion of the almost complete lack of economists in  Ukraine itself--promoted in an interview, incidentally, by none  other than former Prime Minister Kuchma. The latest collapse of  inferiority, which was in fact fostered by Kuchma's Cabinet and  "reforms," impelled the seekers of economic independence from  Dnepropetrovsk to seek rescuers for their independence in Moscow  this time, not Kiev. All for the best, of course--yet many are  afraid the lesson will follow the old programs....

headline:    Crimea Deputy Favors Expanded Economic Rights 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with Ivan Ermakov, deputy of the Supreme Council   of the Crimean republic, by A. Baranov; place and date not  given: "It Is Still Gloomy in Crimea"]    [Text] A local constitution and parliament already exist on  the Crimean peninsula, and there is also a president. The  election of the president, however, is only half the issue.  While daisies bloom in Alupka a session of the "main"  parliament, lacking a speaker, is working out a new political  course.    Ivan Ermakov, a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Crimean  republic, is our interlocutor.    [Baranov] Ivan Fedosovich, elections indicated that the  great  majority of Crimeans are pro-Russian. Does it seem to you that  Mr. Meshkov won a very perilous victory and should the Crimean  parliament allow for the president with a speaker more familiar  to Kiev?    [Ermakov] The experience of numerous elections of recent  years indicated that we are still not so much living with  democracy as playing at it. Candidates, making fantastic  promises, are playing, and the voters are also playing, forcing  themselves to believe the obvious fantasies.    In a month or so neither the one elected nor, surprisingly  enough, the voters themselves recall those election campaign  promises. I feel confident that Crimeans voted not so much for  the person or his position as in opposition to the official  course. As far as the "president-speaker" line is concerned, it  is impossible to push through a convenient figure in our  parliament. If Kiev wants to affect the state of affairs in  Crimea, it is necessary to sharply change the position with  respect to the republic, fulfilling numerous promises and taking  decisive steps to expand economic rights of the region--right up  to the creation of a free economic zone on the peninsula    [Baranov] What do you believe would be the advantages and  disadvantages of Crimea having two currencies in circulation?    [Ermakov] Until a decision is made regarding a free economic  zone in the Crimean region it is difficult for me to imagine a  mechanism involving circulation of two currencies. If the SEZ  (Free Economic Zone] is created, however, then the advantages  are self-evident. That is indicated by international experience.    [Baranov] There is a lot of talk in Moscow about the desire  of the Russian community in Crimea to take part in the political  life of Russia. Is that really so?    [Ermakov] So far there have been too many problems within  Crimea because of which that is hardly possible today. But the  desire is an understandable one and I share it.    [Baranov] Will the citizens of Crimea be able to obtain dual  citizenship?    [Ermakov] This topic was included in practically all of the  election campaigns, including my own. An issue that important  should not be put off. But neither the president of Crimea nor  parliament have plans concerning secession from Ukraine,  particularly in the light of economic disintegration, collapse  of the financial system, and in the long-term, possibly the loss  of statehood. We shall see what new members of the Ukrainian  parliament will say--I am hoping for common sense.    [Baranov] Speaking of common sense. Is resumption of work on  the construction of the Crimean Atomic Electric Power Station  possible?    [Ermakov] The probability of that is low: first of all,  everything has long ago been pilfered, and, secondly, it is  necessary to return to the numerous expert reviews and determine  whether it was emotion or real miscalculations by designers that  did not permit the completion of this construction project. My  view is that atomic electric power stations should not be built  in Crimea. That would be a sin. Particularly since we have  completely unique natural conditions for creation of  ecologically pure sources of energy such as solar power stations.    [Baranov] What should Crimeans and Russian vacationers  expect  from the opening of a national bank and a currency exchange  market this year? Crimean coupons?    [Ermakov] Because of the absence of a printing facility  there  can be no talk of a local currency. One should likewise not  expect any radical improvement with the resolution of questions  of financial health, but the problem with cash, credit, and  foreign currency accounts will be eased. A true solution lies in  the extension of statehood or the creation of a SEZ    [Baranov] Who will the Crimean customs service be  protecting?  The vacationers?    [Ermakov] So far talk about a customs service is limited to  rumors.    [Baranov] What if a "Russian Crimea" movement should appear  tomorrow in Russia, or, in the manner of Aksenov, some "ideas  concerning a common fate," what would the attitude be toward  that in Crimea?    [Ermakov] Like every normal person, I would welcome any  movement in Russia, as well as in Belarus or Kazakhstan, which  could benefit the people of Crimea with its multi-national  population.

The determination that an investment project with the  enlistment of foreign investment corresponds to the  aforementioned requirements is made by the Agency for  International Cooperation and Investment, based on the findings  of an independent expert commission that is created by that  Agency.    The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine prepares and publishes,  through the Agency for International Cooperation and Investment,  lists of the enterprises in which foreign investments are  made--provided the criteria indicated in this section of the  Program are upheld--that entail the granting of additional tax,  customs and credit concessions or insurance guarantees. These  concessions may be granted for investments in other entities  that are not indicated on those lists as well, if they  correspond to the criteria of this section of the Program and  are made in the spheres indicated in Section 2 of the Program.    Foreign investments in enterprises that are indicated in the  lists of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine are made on the  basis of competition among investment projects.  <H6>  Section 4 </H6> <H6>  The Substance of the Concessions That Are Granted in  Relation to Investment Projects in the Priority Spheres </H6>   Foreign investment projects in the priority spheres  indicated  in Section 4 of the Program receive the following concessions,  provided they meet the criteria in Section 3 of the Program:    4.1. The use of accelerated depreciation standards for  machinery and equipment.    4.2. The period of exemption from taxation of profits  (income) stipulated by Article 31 of the Decree of the Cabinet  of Ministers of Ukraine, "Conditions of Foreign Investment," is  increased regardless of the amount of foreign investment by one  year for investments of up to 500,000 dollars U.S. inclusive,  for two years for investments from more than 500,000 to five  million dollars U.S. inclusive, for three years for investments  of more than five million to 50 million dollars U.S., and for  five years for investments of more than 50 million dollars U.S.    4.3. The granting of a tax credit on beneficial terms with  regard to those types of taxes that are subject to payment in  the first three years of existence of an enterprise with foreign  investments. The indicated concession pertains exclusively to  items 2.1.1--2.1.5 and 2.4.1.    4.4. The return of 50 percent of the import duty paid for  bringing across the border from abroad goods for industrial  purposes, and 100 percent for parts, units and assemblies  imported under cooperation, if their use for the production of  the enterprise with foreign investments is certified.

Insurance for the investment risks through a special  budgetary fund for insurance guarantees.  <H6>  Section 5 </H6>     It is essential, in order to create reliable legal  guarantees  with regard to foreign investment:    5.1. To resolve the issue of granting enterprises with  foreign investments that have the status of a legal person in  Ukraine the right to own the plot of land on which the objects  of the investment are located.    5.2. To simplify the procedure for the participation of  foreign investors in the process of privatizing state property.    5.3. To develop and adopt a procedure to compensate foreign  investors for losses, including lost profits and moral losses,  that are caused as a result of unlawful actions or the unlawful  inaction of state bodies of Ukraine and their officials.    5.4. To make changes and additions to the Decree of the  Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, "Conditions of Foreign  Investment," with regard to simplifying registration procedures  connected with foreign investment.    5.5. To prepare and reach bilateral agreements with the  countries that are the principal economic partners of Ukraine,  as well as countries that could potentially be a source for  enlisting foreign investments, to encourage and mutually protect  investments and agreements on avoiding double taxation.    5.6. To adopt laws on the protection of intellectual  property  in accordance with prevailing international treaties  (conventions) in this sphere, with the aim of creating  conditions for investments associated with high technologies in  Ukraine.  <H6>  Section 6 </H6> <H6>  Development of the Infrastructure of International Business  and Other Preconditions of Foreign Investment </H6>   It is essential, in order to create suitable conditions for  enlisting foreign investment:    6.1. To make marked improvements in the operating techniques  of the funds exchanges, commercial banks and insurance companies  of Ukraine, create intersector networks of investment companies  and funds of trust and holding companies, auditing and  consulting firms with the enlistment in collaboration and  consultation of specialists from the UN, the World Bank, the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the  Commission of the European Union and other international  organizations, as well as leading foreign firms.    6.2. To create within the Agency for International  Cooperation and Investment a State Register of foreign investors  and databases on the objects of foreign investment in Ukraine.    6.3. To create a Ukrainian Bank for Reconstruction and  Development, to which would be assigned the functions of  granting beneficial credit as envisaged by Paragraph 4.5 of the  Program.    6.4. To create a National Insurance Company of Ukraine to  insure risks as envisaged in Paragraph 4.6 of the Program.    6.5. To create an automated information system that would  support the efficient search for partners in the sphere of  foreign investment, as well as a suitable regimen for  consultative discussions on issues of law, finance, credit,  insurance and technical and economic expert analysis of  investment projects.    6.6. To arrange for the issue of an anthology of laws and  other official documents of Ukraine on questions of investment  and foreign-economic activity in Ukraine in the English, German,  French, Spanish and Arab languages, as well as references and an  information bulletin on questions of foreign investments.    6.7. To implement, in the shortest possible time, the  introduction of statistical reporting in Ukraine on the  processes of foreign investment based on the utilization of a  system of national transactions and balance of payments of  Ukraine in conformity with international standards for  accounting and reporting.    6.8. To designate the base educational institutions in  Ukraine and abroad for the training and retraining of national  specialists on questions of management, financing, credit,  insurance, currency operations and operations with securities,  banking, accounting, auditing and international law, and to  develop a system of state certification of the national  educational institutions that are conducting training in those  areas.  <H6>  Section 7 </H6> <H6>  The Role of the Regions of Ukraine in Encouraging Foreign  Investment </H6>   The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, oblast,  and Kiev and Sevastopol city state administrations can develop  and approve their own programs to encourage foreign investment  proceeding from the specific nature of the economy of the  corresponding regions. These regional programs are realized  through concessions that are granted within the limits of the  corresponding local taxes and levies, as well as the budgetary  funds of the corresponding regions.    This Program may be amended and clarified by resolution of  the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine proceeding from changes in the  economic situation, the appearance of new problems that require  solution, and the gaining of experience in the sphere of  enlisting foreign investment.  <H6>  The Law of Ukraine on the State Program to Encourage Foreign  Investment in Ukraine </H6>   The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine decrees:    To establish that the relations associated with encouraging  foreign investments in Ukraine and the establishment of the  basic priorities for foreign investment in the economy of  Ukraine are regulated by the State Program to Encourage Foreign  Investment in Ukraine appended to this Law, and is an  inalienable part of it.

headline:    Ukraine Said to `Pirate' Russian Fuel to West Europe 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Unattributed item: "Pirates Against Their Will"]     [Text] Due to the fuel shortage Ukraine is compelled to  drain Russian gas in pipelines flowing in transit to West  European countries. An ITAR--TASS correspondent was informed  about this by one of the Ukrgazprom executives who wished to  remain unanimous. Ukrgazprom representatives refused to indicate  the amount of gas taken from Russia in that manner.    As indicated by material released by the UNIAN agency,  thanks  to its energetic "pirating," Ukraine provided heating for  communal needs and prevented stoppage of major industrial  enterprises during the recent freezing weather. At present the  situation is becoming stabilized as temperatures start to rise.  Several more days, however, will be needed in order to renew the  export delivery of Russian gas in full volume. In accordance  with Ukrainian - Russian agreements such acts require payment of  fines.

headline:    Recent Currency Emission Suspected, New Inflationary Round Anticipated 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by V. Kuznechikov: "Has the Ukrainian National Bank   Capitulated Again?"]    [Text] Reliable sources reveal that the National Bank of  Ukraine, heeding arguments of the Cabinet of Ministers,  allocated around four trillion karbovantsy for the stabilization  fund. It is believed that the stabilization fund will be used to  ensure timely payment of pensions and wages. It is highly  probable that part of the funds will be used to pay of debts to  agriculture and to increase the working capital of a number of  enterprises, including those in the woodworking branch. All that  is fine. However, from the same sources indicate that those  trillions were hardly stored in the basement of the National  Bank. Which means... Exactly. Serious apprehensions appear that  the printing press was once again put to work. If that is the  case then it is easy to imagine the catastrophic consequences of  another emission. "Greenbacks" will rise sharply, while  Ukrainian "candy wrappers" will go down. It is not unlikely that  in a week or so a dollar will fetch 60,000 karbovantsy, if not  more. It is not difficult to guess what unlimited opportunities  will appear for foreign investors wishing to participate in our  ill-starred privatization. Unless the government introduces  protective measures they will be able to buy-up the country for  a song. All of it--down to the last bolt. It is true that some  of the optimists are nurturing the hope that occasionally even  those sources worthy of attention can be wrong.    Meanwhile the dollar to karbovanets exchange rate in Kiev is  already one to 59,000. Unfortunately the predictions are coming  true.

headline:    Overview of 1993 Lvov Oblast Socio-Economic Statistics 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Yevheniya Romaniv: "The Old Year in the Mirror   of Statistics"]    [Text] Enough of wordy indignation over our economy. Even  the sharpest, most withering and insulting diatribes are just  "commentary" to which the latest feeble government has already  adjusted. We can only console ourselves that it is doing so  little that there will be fewer mistakes to correct later.  Better to talk specifics--statistical figures, and look at the  example of Lvov Oblast to see how well we're managing in our  independent state.    Labor. In 1993 the volume of industrial output  fell by 15.9 percent--more than three billion karbovantsy in  monetary terms. December was the laziest of the 12 brother  months (a 29.6-percent decline), meaning the crisis is getting  worse. Nor did January put a stop to our decline; many  enterprises, after all, started their new business year with the  holidays. Two thirds of the oblast's enterprises reduced their  output, especially the Yavorov and Rozdol sulphur operations,  the tobacco factory, the Drogobych Oil Refinery, and the  Elektron and Kineskop associations, where the decline ranged  from 64.9 to 31 percent.    Farm work ended the year with just one plus on the chart of  its basic indicators--grain production. Everything else (sugar  beets, flax, potatoes, vegetables) shows nothing but minuses.  Still, almost all the planned areas have been sown for grain and  fodder for the next crop.    Meat production, like milk yields, declined between 31 and 1  percent in all rayons. The "champions" were the livestock  farmers of Nikolayevskiy, Pustomytovskiy, and Busskiy rayons  (meat), and Brodovskiy and Mostisskiy rayons (milk)--not  counting the hill territories, of course. The champion laggards  were Gorodokskiy and Mostisskiy rayons, where egg production  declined by 98 and 82 percent, respectively.    Prices. It was this pathetic labor output,  clearly, that produced the chronic goods shortage, especially  food--and immediately, secret prices reacted; lately they have  been on the verge of jumping even higher. Throughout 1993 they  rose by an average of 44 percent a month (70 percent in  December). Leading the way were oil, fish products, and  margarine (103-fold and 90-fold increases in the year), eggs,  bread, butter, tea, meat, and dairy goods (81-fold to 71-fold),  alcoholic beverages, sugar, cheese, confections, and groats  (63-fold to 50-fold).    The cost of non-food products kept rising. The biggest jump  (90-fold to 50-fold) was in hand soap and detergents, knit  goods, and building materials. In price policy, 1993 was most  discriminatory toward children, although it was only making up  earlier imbalances caused by artificially reducing prices on  those goods under populist slogans that were economically  unsound. Preschoolers' clothing jumped 170-fold (!) while  women's rose 102-fold and men's 82.9-fold.    In village markets, prices on honey, oil, lard, poultry, and  eggs rose 82-fold to 55-fold. Sales in the markets, as in the  stores, declined due to people's reduced purchasing power. On  the black market, the highest prices were on children's clothing  and shoes, furniture, electrical appliances, perfume, caviar,  and imported food items.    Wages. It's not by chance we're discussing wages  right after prices, although they ought to be tied to labor. By  objective economic laws, everyone should receive as much as he  earns. Hence, if a plant's output declines there ought to be  minuses on the payroll too. Our wage system, brought up in a  troubled home where Mother Labor's vote counted less than Father  Social Protection's, took the wrong path. Instead of going  according to the results of output, wages blindly followed  prices and neglected their own worth month by month. The result:  overall production has dropped appreciably while pay has risen  substantially. In November, for example, average wages rose by  25.4 percent to 254,900 karbovantsy. That's the result of a  destructive price policy that is out of sync with labor output  and remuneration. We preach world prices but ignore world  production and world wage levels. That's why we're in such a  fix. Even that big pay jump in November--received in December,  by the way--was not enough to cover the cost of December's  grocery basket. Compare average wages of 254,900 with fixed food  costs of 416,943 karbovantsy.    The very concept of "average wages" today is doubtful. The  gap between the highest and lowest average sectorial wages  widened greatly--8.3-fold in November, for example. Wage  fluctuations are even greater between specific sectors. Workers  in financial organs (banks) and insurance were paid an average  of 1,216,700 karbovantsy, versus 146,500 in health care and  social security and 165,500 in culture. In industry, wages were  296,300, but this relatively decent figure was due to miners;  workers in other trades got considerably less.    Demography. Given these statistics, I think, we  can understand the continuing demographic decline in 1993.  Natural increase fell by 40 percent over the year and stood at  1.2 per 1,000 inhabitants, versus 2 per 1,000 in 1992. It was  due to a birth rate that fell from 13.2 to 12.6 per 1,000  combined with a death rate that rose from 11.2 to 11.4 per  1,000. In all civilized countries, demographic indicators lead  every other statistic. Prosperity there is not measured by the  number of cars or kilograms of sausage per inhabitant but by the  standard of living in the particular country--because people who  live well live a long time. Sad to say, we can't be proud of  that statistic or any other.    Let Bismarck's statement that every nation has the  government  it deserves be our guide during this pre-election period. And  although we won't be electing a government but a parliament, it  will still have to approve the Cabinet of Ministers and will  determine whether it deserves the people's trust. Which depends  on us. Let's not be wrong!

headline:    1993 Economic Statistics Summarized 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Report of the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine on   Ukraine's Socioeconomic Situation in 1993: "The Prolonged Crisis  Continues"]    [Text] In 1993, the gross domestic product in the economy  of Ukraine decreased by 14 percent for the year, the produced  national income--by 15 percent, and national labor  productivity--by 13 percent. The trend in the slump in the gross  national product and national income continues, although some  slowing down in its rate has been noted.    Difficulties with material-technical supplies, the  disruption  in economic relations, the continuous increase in prices, and  the insolvency of enterprises have led to a further drop in  industrial production. The slow process in destatization did not  give positive results. A reduction in production occurred at  enterprises of almost all forms of property, except collective,  but its negligible proportion had no effect on the results of  the work of all of industry.    While in the first half year of 1993, the rates of cuts in  production slowed down somewhat, in the second half of the year  the slump in production intensified and for the whole year  exceeded 7 percent. Labor productivity fell by 3 percent. Every  second enterprise reduced the volume of production of products  compared to last year. The biggest slump in production was in  enterprises of the oil refining, chemical and petrochemical, and  coal industries, in ferrous metallurgy, the building materials  industry, and in light industry.    The intensification of crisis phenomena in industry is  connected in some measure with the reduction in production  volumes in the fuel-energy complex. The extraction of the basic  types of fuel in a standard calculation was reduced for the year  by 12 percent. The extraction of oil and gas condensate was less  by 5 percent, coal--by 13 percent, including coke--by 17  percent, and gas--by 8 percent. As a result of a decrease in  extraction and a reduction in imported deliveries, the volumes  of refined oil decreased by 15 million tonnes, or by 39 percent,  and, as a consequence, the output of motor vehicle gas was cut  by 35 percent (1.9 million tonnes), diesel fuel by 24 percent (2  million tonnes), mazut fuel by 40 percent (7 million tonnes).  The shortage of fuel affected the volumes of production of  electric power--at thermal electric power stations whose share  in the total development of electric power exceeds 60 percent.  For the year, the thermal power stations cut the production of  electric power by 16 percent, as a result of which its total  output decreased by 9 percent. At the same time, more electric  power was produced by nuclear and hydroelectric power stations  (by 2 and 39 percent, respectively) than in 1992.    The tense situation with the production and supply of  fuel-energy resources had a negative effect on other branches of  industry, and especially on metallurgy, one of the most fuel and  energy-consuming industries. By comparison with the 1992 level,  the production of all of the main types of products of industry  decreased.    Production was cut in nonferrous metallurgy enterprises, in  the chemical industry, in machine building, and in the building  materials industry.    The situation remained difficult in agriculture in 1993. At  the same time, some symptoms of its stabilization appeared. The  rates of reduction in the production of agricultural products  were reduced substantially. The volume of gross products in  comparison with the previous year decreased only by 2 percent,  and, at the same time, plant-growing products increased by 7  percent.    Farms of all categories produced 45.6 million tonnes of  grain  in weight after processing, which is 18.3 percent more than in  1992; sugar beets (factory)--33.6 million tonnes (by 16.8  percent); potatoes--20.9 million tonnes (by 3.3 percent more);  vegetables--5.8 million tonnes (10.1 percent more); and  sunflowers--2.2 million tonnes (at the level of the previous  year).    The situation in livestock raising remains acute. Sovkhozes  and collective and interfarm agricultural enterprises in 1993  produced 2.6 million tonnes of meat in live weight, which is 23  percent less than in 1992; 11.6 million tonnes of milk (by 10  percent less); 6.1 billion eggs of all types (by 18 percent  less). The production of livestock products in subsidiary farms  of the population increased.    A negative trend in the reduction of the total number of  cattle and a drop in its productivity in the public sector  continued.    Capital construction during the report period was  characterized by an imbalance between investment programs and  the financial capabilities for their implementation in  connection with the continuous increase in prices for building  materials and energy sources.    Because of inadequate financing (in the main), the start-up  program for putting important production and environmental  protection facilities into operation was not implemented. Out of  343 facilities that were included by name in Ukraine's 1993  state contract, only one-sixth were put into operation, of which  almost a fourth were only partially implemented.    A further worsening occurred in 1993 in the condition of  national economic and passenger transportation by all types of  transport of the country.    During 1993, the unbalance of state finances became more  pronounced. According to preliminary data of the Ministry of  Finance of Ukraine, the consolidated budget of Ukraine for the  year came to a deficit of 7.9 trillion karbovantsy, which  constituted 6.8 percent with respect to the gross domestic  product.    There was an expenditure from the budget for the national  economy of 12.6 trillion karbovantsy, or 21.8 percent of all  expenditures; for defense--2.8 trillion karbovantsy, or 4.9  percent; for administration--3 trillion karbovantsy, or 5.2  percent, and the expenditures associated with the elimination of  the aftereffects of the Chernobyl catastrophe totaled 1.8  trillion karbovantsy, which is 0.7 trillion karbovantsy less  than the payments to this fund.    The deficit of the state budget for 1993 totaled 10.3  trillion karbovantsy, and in December alone it increased by 2.9  trillion karbovantsy, or by 39 percent. Expenditures for the  social protection of the population made up a substantial share  of the expenditures of the state budget--37.4 percent of all  expenditures.    The volumes of credit investments of the banking system in  the national economy for 1 January 1994 totaled 54 trillion  karbovantsy. The emission of money for the year increased by a  factor of 25 and totaled 12.3 trillion karbovantsy.    The monetary incomes of the population totaled 65.7 trillion  karbovantsy. The expenditures of the population totaled 54.2  trillion karbovantsy. The wages of the workers of the state  sector of the economy for last year increased almost by a factor  of 50 and in December 1993 totaled 793,000 karbovantsy, as  compared to 16,000 in the corresponding month of 1992. The  average monthly wage of kolkhoz workers increased for the year  by a factor of 29.5 and totaled 106,000 karbovantsy. The level  of inflation rose significantly in 1993. Prices for consumer  goods and paid services increased by more than a factor of 100.    The labor resources of Ukraine in 1993 totaled more than 29  million persons. A total of 557,500 temporarily unemployed  citizens were registered with the state employment service. For  1993, 11 billion karbovantsy were expended from the population  employment assistance fund for unemployment benefits.    The size of the population of Ukraine on 1 January 1994 was  52.135 million persons, and it decreased in comparison with 1993  by 0.2 percent, or by 109,000 persons.    More than one-fourth of the entire population of Ukraine  consists of pensioners, whose number is increasing every year.  The government has undertaken measures for the social protection  of the population.    The crime-conducive situation has remained difficult. The  number of crimes registered by organs of Internal Affairs  exceeded the level of 1992 by 12 percent and totaled 539,300  cases; every fourth registered crime is grave.    An extremely tense situation, conditioned by a sharp  decrease  in the output of commodities, has developed in the consumer  market. For the year they were produced in the amount of 74  trillion karbovantsy at wholesale factory prices, which is 16.5  percent less than in 1992. In 1993, the quality composition of  the food ration of the population deteriorated. The consumption  of meat and meat products was only 46 kilograms, which is less  in comparison with the previous year by 7 kilograms, milk and  milk products--275 kilograms (less by 10 kilograms), eggs--193  each (less by 34 eggs), fish and fish products--3.2 kilograms  (less by 4.1 kilograms), sunflower oil--8 kilograms (less by 2.6  kilograms), sugar--39 kilograms (6 kilograms less). There was an  increase in the consumption of bakery products, potatoes, fruit,  berries, grapes, vegetables, and melons and gourds.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Seventy-one stock exchanges were established in the  republic,  and 41 were conducting practical activity. The volumes of  concluded agreements on the exchanges totaled 313 billion  karbovantsy, which is more than in 1992 by a factor of almost  10. The growth was due mainly to high prices for food products,  commodities, and services.    According to preliminary data, the volume of the foreign  trade turnover of Ukraine with countries that were formed on the  territory of the former USSR for 1993 totaled 58.8 trillion  karbovantsy, including exports--20.7 trillion karbovantsy and  imports--38.1 trillion karbovantsy, which resulted in a negative  balance in foreign trade of 17.4 trillion (mainly owing to  payments for natural gas, oil, and oil products), including with  the Russian Federation--12.6 trillion. The Russian Federation  has the biggest share in the foreign trade turnover of Ukraine  with states of the former USSR--75 percent.    In the second half of 1993, the process of destatization of  the property of industrial enterprises accelerated somewhat. The  proportion of enterprises of a nonstate form of property in the  overall number of enterprises increased to 32 percent, as  compared with 25 percent in 1992. These enterprises produced  output for 47 trillion karbovantsy, or 29 percent of the total  volume of products. The process of the destatization of  enterprises in the sphere of services is continuing. The number  of leased enterprises of everyday services of the population is  increasing. The process of privatization of the state housing  fund has started and has picked up considerable speed.

headline:    Support for Private Enterprise Strong 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Doctor of Philosophical Sciences Valeriy   Khmelko, chief of the department of sociology of the Kiev-Mohyla  Academy University, under the rubric "Election 94--27 March":  "Deep Down, Most of Us Are Private Operators"]    [Text] Given that the greatest concern of voters is the  condition of the economy, their attitudes toward the main  alternatives on which various proposals for overcoming the  economic crisis are actually based are particularly interesting.  The well-known political forces fall on the common ideological  cliche of "capitalism or socialism" in order to characterize the  opposition of these alternatives. However, this merely makes the  essence of the issue mythical because actually this is about the  opposition of two kinds of "capitalism": one--with free  competition, which defends the right of man to private economic  activities and ensures free competition among various forms of  ownership and organization of production, and the other, which  we are directly familiar with, is state-monopoly capitalism,  which bans (or extremely constrains) private economic activities  by the people, destroys free competition, and protects the  monopoly of the machinery of state on the command management of  the entire economy.    Capital forms the economic foundation of both these systems.  However, in the former case it is mostly private capital, and in  the latter case solely state capital. For almost 60 years (since  the end of the 1920's) we have lived under the absolute  dominance of state property and its administrators. In the last  few years (since the late 1980's), a small proportion of  capital, approximately 8 percent, has become private. At  present, when state capital remains dominant but the process of  privatization is advancing somehow, albeit at a snail's pace,  Ukraine is confronted with the decisive choice of who to elect  to the new parliament: those who will stop the development of  private enterprise or, on the contrary, those who will support  its development.    At present, not only the fate of Ukrainian independence but  also the welfare of a majority of Ukraine's citizens hinge on  the correct resolution of this issue. For this reason the  attitude of voters toward the development of private enterprise  in Ukraine and, accordingly, toward private property is  particularly interesting.    What is the opinion of urban voters?    Only 11 percent of those surveyed believe that private  enterprise should not be developed, 14 percent refrained from  giving a firm answer, and an impressive majority--75  percent--believe that private enterprise should be developed.  More than one-half of the latter come out in favor of developing  private enterprise as rapidly as possible.    These data indicate that despite the catastrophic condition  of the economy and the efforts of certain forces to pass off the  appearance of the private enterprise sector as the main reason  for the economic crisis and impoverishment of the people, a  majority of people do not believe this (75 percent of urban  voters amounts to more than one-half of all voters). In the last  two years the proportion of urban residents who do believe it  has increased only slightly. According to data in surveys by the  Kiev International Institute of Sociology together with the  research department of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) in  December 1991 and November 1992, at the time respectively 6 and  10 percent of those polled among the urban population (answering  the same questions as this time) came out against the  development of private enterprise. On both occasions, 83 percent  came out in favor of developing private enterprise--only 8  percent more than at present.    It is also important to note that opponents of the  development of private enterprise are almost 1.5 times less  numerous among those who intend to turn out for the elections  and those who are not sure than among those who do not intend to  turn out. On the other hand, supporters of the development of  private enterprise account for 69 percent of those who do not  intend to vote and 72 percent among those who are not sure,  whereas among the voters who intend to vote the proportion of  supporters of private enterprise comes to 79 percent. Of these,  42 percent came out in favor of developing private enterprise as  fast as possible, and 37 percent believe that private enterprise  should be developed slowly and gradually.    Among the urban population as a whole, men (79 percent) came  out in favor of developing private enterprise more often then  women (71 percent). This support falls with age (from 86 percent  among young people to 59 percent among those over 60) and grows  with the educational level. Among those with less than a  secondary education, 57 percent of urban residents have a  positive attitude toward private enterprise, among those with a  complete secondary education--77 percent, and among those with a  higher education--87 percent. The proportion of such voters is  notably greater among students (95 percent), managers (89  percent), servicemen (88 percent), and specialists (86 percent)  than among clerical employees (79 percent) and workers (76  percent), and especially retirees (58 percent). Among unskilled  workers, 64 percent came out in favor of private enterprise,  whereas among skilled workers the figure was 82 percent.    Overall support for the development of private enterprise is  actually the same among Ukrainians and Russians (73-74 percent).  However, "gradualists," if you will, the supporters of the slow  and gradual implementation of this development, are somewhat  more numerous among Ukrainians--37 percent compared to 32  percent among Russians. Among the latter, "radicals," supporters  of the fastest possible development of private enterprise, are  somewhat more numerous: 41 percent against 37 percent among  Ukrainians.    The difference between the urban populations of the Western  and Eastern Regions is even greater in this regard. The  proportion of "gradualists" among voters in the West (45  percent) is considerably greater than in the East (25 percent),  and the proportion of "radicals" in the East (41 percent) is  somewhat greater than in the West (35 percent).    However, in general it might make sense for candidates for  Supreme Council deputy to factor in the fact that even in the  east of Ukraine an impressive majority, two-thirds of those  surveyed, come out in favor of the development of private  enterprise. This is to say nothing about the south and the  center, where more than three-quarters of urban voters come out  in favor of it, and in particular the west, where this  proportion reaches four-fifths.

headline:    Minister Views Import-Export Regulations 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Minister of External Economic Ties Oleh   Ivanovych Slyepichev, by Anatoliy Kraslyanskyy; place and date  not given: "Commerce is not Trade. Commerce Is an Art, or How  Can Anyone at the External Economic Department Be Optimistic in  1994?"]    [Text] A package of documents that will regulate our  country's foreign economic activity in 1994 has been submitted  to Ukraine's Supreme Council for consideration. It will be a  continuation of work started at the end of last year, when the  Ministry of External Economic Ties asked Ukraine's Supreme  Council to introduce certain changes into those governmental  edicts that regulate export-import relations. We turned to  minister O. Slyepichev with a request to comment on the changes  that will take place in 1994 in this branch, which is important  for independent Ukraine.    [Slyepichev] Just two years have passed since Ukraine  achieved its independence, and it is perfectly understandable  that now, during the period of development of our young state,  we must create our own system of external economic relations  with the world community. This is a quite complex process --  the system will improve in the course of years, but one thing  may be said with certainty: Ukraine's external economic policy  must be nationwide, clear and legally balanced, and not narrow  and departmental.    [Kraslyanskyy] What proposals did the External Economic  Department submit to the Supreme Council and what does it  primarily want to achieve this year?    [Slyepichev] First is the encouragement of exports through  extensively liberalizing export policy. For this, it is  envisaged to abolish the double use of the nontariff (quota or  nonquota) and tariff (extra-quota or taxed) regulation of  exports of the same types of goods, to introduce preferred  issuing of quotas to producers of corresponding products, and to  improve the sale of quotas at auctions.    However, it is also necessary to know how to use quotas. On  last year's example, we know that our country produced more than  25 million tonnes of metal, but only about 8 million tonnes were  in fact sold. In my opinion, it is necessary to establish a  procedure to have quotas passed on to other exporters if they  are not used within three months.    Second, the provision of an effective structure of exports  and the formation of imports taking into account the interests  of national producers. It is extremely important to separate  exports from imports, to revise the rates of customs duty on  imports during barter operations, proceeding from the required  supply of critical imports, especially raw materials. The  purchase of those products, which are manufactured or may be  manufactured in Ukraine, must be limited.    I believe that it is necessary in 1994 to introduce import  quotas to use our currency resources rationally.    Third, it is necessary to intensify state control over  external trade operations and to ensure the timely and full  transfer of hard-currency earnings to the State Currency Fund.  In my opinion, to this end, we must adopt a system of  guaranteed settlements for highly-liquid types of products. I  do not only mean preliminary payments, but also, for example,  methods of closed accrediting in Ukrainian banks. When goods  cross the border, such a letter of credits is opened, and the  hard currency remains in our state. Besides, it is necessary  substantially to reduce hard-currency accounts opened by  national exporters abroad with the permission of Ukraine's  National Bank and radically to revise the procedure for granting  such rights.    Finally, to ensure that, during our integration into the  system of world trade, the state will not be answerable for the  carelessness and incompetence of its exporters, it is necessary  to set, on a monthly basis, indicative prices of main types of  export products on traditional international markets and their  minimal levels below which exports are forbidden.    It is only with the help of such a complex of measures that  we will be able to ensure the reduction of the trade deficit,  improve external solvency, and earn hard currency in amounts  sufficient for our important internal needs.    [Kraslyanskyy] There has recently been much talk on  establishing special conditions for exports. What is behind  this talk and will there be certain restrictions to the state's  advantage?    [Slyepichev] I think that, in our conditions, this is a  perfectly normal phenomenon. There are things that are  strategically important for us: Nonferrous metals, petroleum  products, precious metals, and so on, whose sale must only be in  the hands of special authorized exporters. However, they must  be appointed on the basis of competition.    Besides, the state must also control some types of export  products (weapons, metal products, or agricultural raw  materials) that may earn us particularly large amounts of hard  currency. In accordance with state contracts, manufacturing  enterprises or individual external trade organizations will sell  these goods on a tender basis with state guarantees for the  deliveries from storage of enterprises to ports. All money  obtained from such sales must be transferred to the state  budget. This approach will only do us good.    [Kraslyanskyy] Your strategy is clear, and it seems to be  instrumental at this stage of economic management. However, to  implement it, it may be necessary radically to change the  legislative basis. Will you be proposing a new bill on external  economic activity?    [Slyepichev] We have a rather good law on external economic  activity, and the Supreme Council did the right thing in  canceling additional decrees in this sphere. Ministry  specialists and scientists did their best just to introduce  certain amendments, reflecting today's realities, and the law  will work fine. Businessmen and business circles need, first and  foremost, stability in the economic policy, and this stability  may only be ensured by legislation.    [Kraslyanskyy] To conclude our conversation, are you in  favor of restoring the management of internal trade at a state  level? How, do you think, this problem may be resolved?    [Slyepichev] It is true that, today, we are criticized for  creating administrations for questions of trade, but there can  be no talk of returning to the old times. We are doing  everything to establish order in the provision of people with  basic commodities and are trying to renew everything good that  we had, for example, the holding of wholesale industrial fairs,  with the participation of several oblasts, where consumer goods  may be purchased. However, the main thing is that there must be  single norms and rules for accounting and controlling commodity  circulation for all those who are engaged in trade, irrespective  of the form of ownership.    Trade must be carried on properly, proceeding from the  knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the world, market  laws, and exchange rates.

headline:    Problem of Disposal of Nuclear Waste Examined 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Dmytro Pavlovych Khrushchov, head of   Lithology Department, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of  Geological Sciences: "Consultation With Geologists Needed To  Avoid Mistakes"; place and date not given]    [Text] We received a letter from Poltava's Zelenyy  Svit [Green World] Association expressing alarm over  uncontrolled development of nuclear energy in Ukraine.  "Ukraine's citizens want answers: Where are they going to store  highly radioactive wastes adding up to 30-40 kilograms per tonne  of spent fuel? Will they be safe during transport? Have the  scientific problems of storing the wastes in Ukraine been worked  out?" Ways to safeguard the wastes are the subject of our  correspondent's interview with Dmytro Pavlovych Khrushchov, head  of the Lithology Department, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences  Institute of Geological Sciences.    [Correspondent] Dmytro Pavlovych, how urgent is the problem  of storing radioactive wastes in Ukraine?    [Khrushchov] The basic source of such wastes here is the  operation of AESes [nuclear power plants], also the fallout from  the Chernobyl AES disaster. According to experts of DKBYaE  [State Committee on the Use of Nuclear Energy], the amount of  radioactive wastes subject to burial in deep geologic formations  by the year 2010 will be about 60,000 cubic meters. Plans used  to call for sending the wastes to Russia for processing, but now  Russia has a law banning the burial of wastes from other  countries, so now we even have to take back the wastes we sent  there earlier. There's really only one way to solve the problem:  bury the hazardous material in our territory in suitable  geologic formations capable of keeping it safely isolated from  the biosphere.    [Correspondent] How are other countries handling the  problem?    [Khrushchov] Many countries have been researching and  experimenting with the problem for 20 to 30 years; the work is  laborious and takes considerable capital investment. Active work  is going on in France, England, and Spain, and Canada and  Belgium have underground laboratories. Meanwhile, the practice  is to place the wastes in special mine shafts for long-term  storage. Germany has an experimental program of burying  medium-radioactive wastes in salt strata. Other countries are  looking into similar possibilities available to them: the Finns  are studying granite strata in the Baltic Shield, the Dutch are  looking into salt. The U.S. has excellent prospects in that  regard in Nevada's Yucca Mountains, where the rocks and climate  are right (very dry) and there are no local population problems,  as they were moved out long ago because of nuclear weapons  testing.    [Correspondent] What are Ukraine's prospects?    [Khrushchov] Ukraine has several options. A large part of  its  territory is on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield, and the  Dnieper-Donets Depression has clay strata and salt. But it's  hard to make the final choice. Problems of isolating and burying  radioactive wastes in Ukraine's geologic formations have been  discussed many times in recent years at inter-departmental  meetings of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, the State  Committee on Geology, the Education Ministry, and also  specialists from the DKVYaE, the Nuclear Energy Inspectorate,  and the Enerhoproekt [Energy Planning and Designing] Institute.  In March 1993 the problem was discussed at a conference of the  Ukraine Supreme Council Commissionon on Higher Education and  Science, which confirmed the need for integrated research and  the formulation of an appropriate state program.    Now that program has been formulated, and these are its  stages:    I (1993-1995). Formulation of the conceptual  principles and allocation of promising areas for reconnaisance  work and selection of test sites.    II (1996-2004). Study of regional, zonal, and  local conditions; forecasting of the consequences of the  construction and operation of underground radioactive waste  isolation facilities.    III (2005-2010). Preparation of the construction  and experimental operation of facilities.    [Correspondent] What do you think of the possibility of  using  nuclear blasts to make such storage places?    [Khrushchov] At first I was tempted to try it. It would be  so  convenient--bang, and there's your facility. After detailed  study, however, we decided the explosions would cause fissures,  so we had to look for other ways. And we found them.    [Correspondent] We've been talking about AES wastes. How  about other kinds, for example military wastes?    [Khrushchov] I don't actually know how things stand. I do  know about the burial of military wastes in salt mines in the  U.S., but I haven't had contacts with our own military.    [Correspondent] Can the same methods be used in burying  toxic  wastes?    [Khrushchov] The situation is more complex. Radioactive  wastes do eventually cease being radioactive, but toxic wastes  never do. I'm worried by the way some nonprofessionals try to  solve these problems at one stroke. We need to make a sound  choice between two approaches--processing and storage. Recently  I was visited by colleagues from Russia who are developing a  variant of toxic waste burial in the potassium mines of the  Pre-Urals. Their concept is not bad, but I did criticize some  approaches.    [Correspondent] A final question. What do you think of the  idea of burial sites where the area is already contaminated--the  30-kilometer zone?    [Khrushchov] No way! It's foolhardy. Ideas like that stem  from ignorance of geological conditions. We can only talk of  burying low- and medium-radioactive wastes. We need to consult  with scientists in order to avoid mistakes!

text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Unsigned item: "To Live Until 2010"]     [Text] But how are we to store wastes until the program is  in place? According to KOMMERSANT UKRAINY, Ukraine's  Derzhkomatom [State Atomic Committee] has placed an order with  Azovmash Concern (Mariupol) for special containers for temporary  storage of spent nuclear fuel.    From 1978 through 1989, Azovmash made 41 containers to  transport spent fuel (starting in 1989, production was stopped  owing to a lack of orders). These containers were the basis for  a model to store spent fuel, TK-13.    As an alternative, a program is being worked out to have the  same combine manufacture Castor WWR-1000 containers using  Germany's Nukem technology. According to Azovmash's people,  implementing the program will take 3.77 billion karbovantsy and  17.9 million German marks. TK-13 will "consume" 13 billion  karbovantsy and 19.5 million U.S. dollars. The production of  Castor containers may start in 1995; TK-13 may start in 1998.  The service life of the former is 50 years; the latter's is five  years.    A special Derzhkomatom appraisal commission is looking at  both proposals. Which will it choose?

headline:    Minister Discusses Potential for Development of Industrial Sector 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Vladimir Skachko, under the rubric "In the   Parties and Movements": "Where the Ukrainian Party Ark, in Which  Everyone from the Neo-Bolsheviks to the Neo-Nazis Has Gathered,  Will Float"]    [Text] Already on the eve of the parliamentary elections it  is possible to state that despite the talk about "party-phobia"  among the broad masses, there are no fewer political parties or  public organizations and associations which they form for  participation in elections. What is more, these formations can  be classified according to the methodology adopted throughout  the world with the traditional "leftist," "center," and  "rightist" segments and separated by pure party political  programs. In other words, Ukraine has seen the end of that  "distorted mirror" of party life from the days of the struggle  against the Communist Party monopoly when it, as the bearer of  public regression and totalitarianism, was not "leftist," as  everywhere else in the world, but "rightist." And the  traditional "rightists" on the planet--the nationalists,  national radicals, and so on--under our conditions were  "leftists," because they fought against political tyranny and  defended the right of peoples to state self-determination.    Today, according to the studies of the Institute of  Strategic  Research (ISI), we have "leftists"--the socialist-communist  orientation--and "rightists"--the nationalist and radical  national formations, plus the two-part "center," which unites  (and this is a unique feature of post-Soviet Ukraine) the  national democrats and pragmatic centrists (see the schematic  chart--author). In the opinion of the ISI, there are five  criteria on which this division is based, specifically attitudes  toward: (1) the idea of state independence; (2) the historical  period when Ukraine was a part of Russia and the USSR; (3)  present-day Russia and the CIS themselves; (4) the form of state  order, organization of power, and political regime in Ukraine;  (5) the purposes, forms, and methods of conducting market  reforms. To the last point I would add that the associations of  citizens are also divided into center, leftist and rightist  extremes by their methods of achieving their goals  (revolutionary or evolutionary).    So, apologizing for the lengthy enumeration, I will try to  present all those who, as in Noah's ark, exist in Ukraine today  and will be struggling for deputy seats. The socialist-communist  complex: the Socialist (SPU) and Communist (KPU) parties and the  public organizations Union of Communists of Ukraine (SKU) and  Front of Laborers of Ukraine (FTU). This also includes the many  regional and republic associations such as Laboring Ukraine, the  All-Ukrainian Communist Party of Bolsheviks, and others. These  parties call for effective social guarantees and closer,  all-encompassing integration into the CIS, oppose rapid market  reforms, and so on.    The centrist-pragmatists include the Party of Democratic  Rebirth (PDVU), the People's Party (NPU), the Liberal Party  (LPU), the Social Democratic Party (SPDU), the Peasant Party  (KresPU), the Ukrainian Party of Beer Lovers (UPLP), the Party  of Labor (PT), the Ukrainian Party of Justice (UPS), the Party  of Economic Rebirth of the Crimea (PEVK), the Constitutional  Democratic Party (KDPU), the Civil Consent Centrist Party  (PTsGS), the Party of National Salvation (PNSU), the Civil  Congress (GKU), the All-Ukrainian Gromada [Community]  Association [VOG], the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social  Justice (UPSSS), the Labor Congress (TKU), the Party of Slavic  Unity (PSYeU), and the New Ukraine Association (NU). These  formations put liberal or socially adjusted market reforms,  private property, democracy, individual freedom and its priority  over the state, and the like above everything else. They often  arose as regional lobbies and associations based on the  interests of particular groups of politicians or social strata.    The national democrats, who defend the priority of democracy  (but with a national slant) and more rapid establishment of  Ukrainian statehood include: the Ukrainian Republican Party  (URP), the Ukrainian Peasant Democratic Party (UKDP), the  Democratic Party (DemPU), the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPU),  the Christian Democratic Party (KhDPU), the Greens Party (PZU),  the People's Movement [Narodnyy Rukh--NRU), the Party of Free  Peasants (PSKU), and these public organizations: the Congress of  National Democratic Forces (KTsDS) and the All-Ukrainian Public  Organization "All-People's Movement of Ukraine" ["Vsenarodnyy  Rukh Ukrainy"--VNRU).    The national radicals are represented by the Ukrainian  Conservative Party (UKRP), the Ukrainian National Conservative  Party (UNKP), the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN), the  All-Ukrainian Political Association "State Independence of  Ukraine" (GSU), the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in  Ukraine (OUNiU), and the public associations: Ukrainian National  Assembly (UNA) and Ukrainian National Self-Defense (UNS). They  fight for building a Ukrainian state at any price, including at  the price of democracy.    The ISI believes that the stability and balance of the  pragmatic centrists make them attractive in the eyes of the  ordinary citizen and rank-and-file voter which, for one, makes a  victory of the "center" entirely likely. For two, the  pragmatists will take over the "center", either pushing the  national democrats toward the "rightists" or making them more  pragmatic in their political aspirations. In this situation a  person cannot help but wonder if the pragmatists, who are likely  to win the election, will be able to move from an attractive  presentation of their moderate programs to an equally attractive  and effective implementation of them in reality. And would it be  for the general welfare, which we very much want.

headline:    Health Hazard Posed by Radar Stations Viewed 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with Yuriy Danylovych Dumanskyy, head of the   Laboratory of Environmental Electromagnetic Factors: "Radar  Stations Are Especially Dangerous to Children"; time and place  not given]    [Text] In our special "Land of Khaki" edition we  described how the Greens blocked the construction of a  superpowerful radar station. Reactions to the Greens' success  varied, including "We've found someone to fight--and it's not  nuclear power plants; they pose no danger." "The Greens are only  hurting Ukraine's defense." To get to the bottom of things we  had our correspondent interview Professor Yuriy Danylovych  Dumanskyy, head of the Laboratory of Environmental  Electromagnetic Factors, Ukrainian Scientific-Hygienic  Center.    [Correspondent] Professor, do radar stations really pose a  danger to health?    [Dumanskyy] Radar stations are a big source of environmental  radiation, producing superhigh-frequency electromagnetic fields.  An electromagnetic field is very damaging to living organisms.  In human beings, for example, the central nervous system suffers  (memory is impaired and reactions slow down). It is especially  harmful to children, as we know from studies in Odessa. At high  levels a person suffers from headaches, fatigue, and  nervousness. Men's potency is reduced and women's menstrual  cycle is disrupted. The effect of the exposure accumulates, but  if it stops, the person recovers and the complaints stop.  Especially high levels (more than 10 milliwats per square  centimeter) cause clouding of the eye lens, the heat effect, and  hallucinations. Plant tissues die and, at high levels, burn.    [Correspondent] Is anybody watching over people's safety in  that regard?    [Dumanskyy] Hygienic normatives have been worked out to  ensure safe conditions for people living in the vicinity of  radar stations. On their basis the Health Ministry issued a  number of requirements to radar station owners involving  relocation, and certification of these units is underway.  However, responses to the requirements have been slow. For  example, the Defense Ministry pleads lack of funds. Moreover,  not all units are covered yet--for example, over-the-horizon  stations.    [Correspondent] Who are the owners, and where are the units  located?    [Dumanskyy] Primarily the Defense Ministry, which has  guidance stations, superpowerful space observation antennas, and  PTO [technical service point] stations. The rest are divided  into long-range and high-range (which are especially dangerous  because their rays often "cling" to the earth). Radar stations  are also used in civil aviation, maritime operations, and the  weather service.    Radar stations are located in population centers or (more  often) not far away. As a result, worrisome situations have  developed in Lvov, Mukachevo, Ivano-Frankovsk, Dnepropetrovsk,  Nikolayev, Odessa, Yevpatoriya, and Kiev. In Sevastopol the  field is so strong that in some places it makes neon lights go  on.    [Correspondent] What is to be done?    [Dumanskyy] Measures to prevent harmful effects of radar  stations include 1) Moving stations outside of populated areas;  2) Resettling the inhabitants; 3) Changing the stations'  operating modes; 4) Changing the angle of radiation; 5) Setting  up restricted radiation zones; 6) Planting woods; 7) Raising the  station above the locality; 8) Protective structures (banks,  fences, dikes, and so on.

headline:    Tajikistan Threatens to Cut Gas Supplies 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Sergey Vlad: "Ukraine's Already Receiving   Ultimatums"]    [Text] The board of the State Committee for Oil and Gas,  which held a meeting in Kiev last week, in a sense recalled a  mirror reflecting our economy from within. Disheveled, with its  pockets turned inside out.    This time the economy was speaking through the voice of  Valentin Kolomiyev, acting chairman of the Ukrgaz Production  Association. Consider for example the following: Last year the  production association purchased gas in Russia valued at 2  trillion Russian rubles, but it paid for 466 billion, including  166 billion on Russian technical credit. In the meantime every  kopeck of the R1.2 billion obtained for transit handling of gas  across Ukrainian territory was used to reduce the price of  natural gas in the domestic market. Up until May inclusively, as  an example, Ukrgaz purchased a thousand cubic meters at a cost  of 15,600 in the karbovanets equivalent, while selling it to  consumers at 6,810 karbovantsy. It was in this way that the debt  was multiplied and the prices of products of chemical,  metallurgical and other sectors of the national economy, which  are already becoming noncompetitive in the foreign market, were  regulated. First one prime minister and then another told us  that there was nothing to fear; still, the socioeconomic  situation is being monitored, though industry is not striking.    It became clear as early as at the beginning of this year  that a strike is not necessary for a work stoppage to occur.  Price inflation has become the cause of financial paralysis.    But we are reassured once again: There is nothing to fear,  such a financial crisis can be seen in other states of the  former Union as well. You're trying to pull the wool over our  eyes, folks, because there's nothing in common between these two  cases. It was revealed at this same meeting of the board of the  State Committee for Oil and Gas that an ultimatum was in fact  sent to acting Prime Minister Ye. Zvyagilskiy in a telegram from  Turkmenistan. It threatened cessation of natural gas deliveries  to Ukraine as of 21 February if it continues to evade payment of  its debts for last year and this year. Last year's debt is not  less than $500 million U.S., while this year's debt consists of  penalties for late payments, as per the signed contract.    In the words of V. Kolomiyev, in January his department  should have paid $284 million for gas. But where was he to get  the money? The $18.4 million obtained through the stock exchange  and tender committee were only enough to pay the penalties for 1  month. In other words Ukraine is reaping its harvest from the  fields of currency regulation: What you sow is what you reap.  And the wretchedness of the currency harvest, which is something  we need for foreign economic activity, distinguishes our  financial crisis from the others.    A hastily created government commission took on the task of  leading the industry out of its crisis of payments, while Yefim  Leonidovich Zvyagilskiy was tasked to settle things with  Turkmenistan. This by the way will not have any effect on the  cost of gas this year. If it does grow more expensive, it will  do so only insignificantly. And the Ukrgaz Production  Association probably shouldn't count on the enterprises  immediately fulfilling government decree No 23 on settling  natural gas accounts in hard currency and Russian rubles. It  seems as if the Ministry of the Economy feels that cheap gas  means an inexpensive life, but it has no idea of what a cheap  policy can bring.    By the way, Turkmenistan's ultimatum carried the threat that  a contract with Ukraine for 28 billion cubic meters would be  broken. Ukraine naturally isn't pleased. And as it became known,  it sat down at the negotiating table with Turkmenistan, offering  to pay its debt off with wheat. But it is now understood even by  people who aren't economists that there will never be enough  wheat to pay off the debts. What we need to do is improve the  system of currency regulation, and the loan and financial  policy. It appears that the National Bank, which offered to  employ market distribution of credit resources and hard currency  this week, was the first to realize this. And it promised  creditors a new weapon with which to fight debtors--the  promissory note.

headline:    Railroad Sector Problems Detailed 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with Lvov Railroad Chief Heorhiy Kirpa by   Mykhaylo Vasylashko (Lvov-Ternopol-Khmelnitskiy): "The Problems  Are Ours; Is the Purse Moscow's?"; date and place not given]    [Text] Anyone who travels often by rail has probably  noticed improvements in passenger service on the Lvov Railroad's  excellent trains. People started talking about service in Lvov  when seasoned railroader Heorhiy Kirpa became chief of the  railroad half a year ago.    Heorhiy Mykolayovych set about finding solutions to problems  of passenger transport. But they can't be solved on the level of  one railroad. The financial crisis is a killer. Russia alone  owes the Lvov Line 32 billion rubles, 8 million Swiss Francs,  and 2.5 million U.S. dollars for passenger transport. Then there  are the debtors at home. For example, the Prydniprovsk Railroad  owes 290 billion Ukrainian rubles.    [Vasylashko] How did this happen?    [Kirpa] You'll recall what Lenin did first to create the  Soviet State. He took over the post office, the telegraph, and  the train stations. And any new regime in the world has first  taken over these key structures. Our own Ukraine has told the  world that it is independent, yet it has not yet taken over the  republic's railroads. Strange as it seems, we still do not have  a law on railroad transport, no haulage regulations, statutes  and other legal acts.    The Transport Ministry, Ukrzaliznytsya [Ukraine Railroad],  has existed for two years, and we have been waiting for answers  to many questions. Yet the economic situation, especially, is  getting worse. Our biggest trouble is that Ukrzaliznytsya has  failed to formulate its own legal status on centralized  payments, has not detached Ukraine's six railroads from the old  Moscow payment system, and has not set up its own center, which  it should and could have done. Worse, last May Kiev asked Moscow  to continue the payments. I chanced to ask about that in  Russia's Railway Ministry, where I had gone to deal with  problems of debt payment.    So much for our sovereignty. We run some kind of operation,  and our neighbor figures our money on the Big Brother principle.  Maybe he pays something if he feels like it. Of the 32 billion  [rubles], the Lvov people have received two billion, and the oil  products haven't been delivered either. Well, it's not  surprising: Ukrzaliznytsya isn't even able to exercise internal  control of payments, institute centralized fund accumulation,  and so on. In short, there is a Ministry but no full-scale,  planned state operation. It's no surprise, then, that something  bad is happening--something like a bazaar--on the railroads,  where discipline and order used to be so good. Conductors take  as much as they can from passengers, cashiers sell tickets  through fictitious persons.    Not only that, but even locomotive engineers are hauling  passengers now. I found out about it because of an accident in  which a passenger in a locomotive was injured by high voltage.  In fact, it's hard to name a single sphere where people aren't  trying to do biznes. It's the result of our economic  policy. Certainly we're doing our best to prevent such  violations. We are reorganizing the auditing system and  automating ticket sales so there won't be empty seats permitting  train masters to sell tickets on the train. But to restore order  we have to fight the causes, not the results. And that, I think,  is the state's department.    The Lvov railroaders are doing what they can to correct the  situation. For shunting operations they have taken more than 30  "revolution-era" steam engines out of mothballs and saved  considerable fuel and oil.    [Vasylashko] But isn't it true, Heorhiy Mykolayovych, that  the railroaders have gone so far as to engage in proletarian  expropriation of fuel and oil--for example the recent case in  Ternopol?    [Kirpa] Railroad transport is the only sector that isn't yet  paralyzed today. Since the state has given all appropriations to  the oil biznes--i.e. the Mafia--and we no longer get  anything on a centralized basis, there's a real danger that the  railroads will shut down, which means economic collapse. It's  out of concern for the state that we have to take such unpopular  steps. And we're retrieving money with those commercial prices.  Starting last October I overpaid the businessmen by 25 percent;  today it's 150 percent. I talked about that huge snag when I met  with Zvyahilskyy. Energy ought to be in the state's hands. Right  now the Mafia is cheating the state. Often, an oil tank car that  has just crossed the border will return to Ukraine, this time to  be re-directed somewhere to the south. What would you do in that  case? Stop the passenger trains? It's impossible, because  passenger traffic has almost doubled. Last year alone we  dispatched an additional 178 trains, and even that's not enough.  The railcar fleet is inadequate. We haven't had a car replaced  in two years.    Let's say we expect no favors from Kiev. We have already  made  a deal with the Northern Railroad to repair cars in Kovel, and  they will buy new ones with the money they make. That's how much  trouble railroaders all over Western Ukraine are in. Although  frankly, they're in somewhat better shape than other regions.  Anyway, without a state program they can't get out of the  crisis. And the Ministry and its leaders today have shown  themselves to be incompetent. After all, what kind of proprietor  is it that works and his neighbor counts his money? In such  circumstances, it is time for either the President or the  Supreme Council to undertake to nationalize the railroads.  Otherwise, we'll lose everything with the railroads and be  buried under the wreckage of sovereign Ukraine.

headline:    Tripartite Agreement Results Pondered 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Volodymyr Skachko under the rubric "Point of   View": "They Have Started Over, Apparently, With More Success"]    [Text] Since there has been no official interpretation, we  should recall, in an elementary manner, the texts of documents  concerning the problem under examination in order to figure out  what kind of decree our Supreme Council adopted on 3 February of  this year and in order to try to analyze the consequences of  this step for all: the text of the decree of 3 February itself,  the text of the Supreme Council decree on the ratification of  the START-1 treaty, dated 18 November 1993, and Article V of the  Lisbon Protocol to the START-1 treaty, dated 28 May 1992. It is  this particular sequence of documents that is important, no  matter what chronological view we take. So, let us have  everything in order: As the 3 February decree says, it cancels  reservations concerning the article of the Lisbon Protocol which  are found in the decree of the Supreme Council dated 18 November  1993. We look at this document and find that the article  mentioned is referred to only in its reservation 3: "Ukraine  does not consider Article V of the Lisbon Protocol binding on  it." This is all. However, 12 more reservations remain! The  article of the protocol itself says that Ukraine must join the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (DNYaZ) as a nonnuclear state.    So, how does it look? Last November our deputies disagreed  with the Lisbon wording of the status of Ukraine and made  reservations that would guarantee to Ukraine its true status as  the owner of the nuclear weapons that have ended up on its  territory, national security, and fair compensation for nuclear  disarmament which is beyond the resources of our economy. In the  process, the START-1 treaty was ratified, but neither the United  States nor Russia recognized this fact because of the  parliamentary reservations.    In keeping with reservation 11 of 18 November, President L.  Kravchuk began negotiation efforts, and the trilateral statement  of 14 January 1994 appeared. If for no other reason, this  document was interesting, to put it mildly, because nothing was  given or guaranteed to Ukraine, but almost everything that the  reservations of the parliament called for was promised. So, by  adopting the 3 February decree, the Ukrainian Supreme Council  actually responded to a promise of guarantees and assistance  with a promise-consent to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty as a nonnuclear state. It ended up being a promise by  Washington and Moscow in exchange for a promise by Kiev because,  first, Article V of the Lisbon Protocol does not provide for  Ukraine joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty urgently and  automatically. Second, the preamble to the decree of 3 February  says that Ukraine is the owner of the components of nuclear  weapons on its territory (see the ninth paragraph of the decree:  This is our status as viewed by Ukraine). Third, I repeat,  another 12 reservations remain in the November decree which call  for the signing of at least 10 state-to-state agreements and  other documents. They are supposed to regulate the problems of  international guarantees of the national security of Ukraine,  economic, scientific-technical, and financial assistance in the  process of nuclear disarmament, manufacturer warranty servicing  of Ukrainian missiles by Russian specialists, a review of  conditions and financing for inspection efforts, opportunities  to use launch silos for peaceful purposes, conditions for the  use of weapons materials from the liquidated nuclear weapons,  and compensation for them. The issues of compensation for  tactical nuclear weapons, the schedule for transferring  strategic missiles to Russia, conditions for this process,  control over dismantling, and so on are to be coordinated  separately. In a word, everything is envisioned that our  government was obligated to do in Point 2 of the decree of 3  February. Only after these conditions are met will Ukraine be  prepared to get rid of nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear country with an easy  heart.    So, it is already possible to say that by agreeing to join  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the Supreme Council of  Ukraine has now confronted the United States and Russia with a  choice of either failing to listen to Ukrainian demands in the  future, too, and bringing pressure to bear on Ukraine, pursuing  a policy of double standards in view of an indulgent attitude  toward the so-called "threshold" states which are prepared to  acquire nuclear weapons; or concluding the agreements envisioned  in the January trilateral statement as soon as possible and  satisfying everyone. At any rate, our parliament, with  astonishing success, has let everybody understand this: If you  help Ukraine you will win; if you bring it to its knees, you  will win, too, but it could be a pyrrhic victory. This may be  the greatest achievement of our parliament in the foreign arena  on 3 February.    There also were domestic achievements, because the Supreme  Council seriously dimmed the halo of the president as the only  supporter of nuclear disarmament in the Ukrainian ruling elite,  testified yet again that all branches of power are to blame for  the critical condition of the Ukrainian state, and obligated  executive power headed by the president to sign advantageous  agreements on the issues of nuclear disarmament, which it put  under strict parliamentary control. At present, the "more  compliant" president and the "noncompliant" Supreme Council are  together. However, the mutual relations between the two branches  of power are another topic....

headline:    Drach on Russo-Ukrainian Relations 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Ivan Drach, chairman of Ukrainian World   Coordinating Council: "Ukraine and Russia: Prospects for  Interrelations"]    [Text] Two years after the official disappearance of the  unforgettable Soviet Union, dialogue by intellectuals with a  highly developed sense of responsibility to their nations and  peoples--Ukraine, Russia, and the CIS countries--is the same  kind of global necessity as the earlier process of detente  between the two world ideological camps that prevented nuclear  war between the United States and the USSR. This applies in  particular to representatives of Russia and Ukraine.    My choice of the common and--as history  demonstrated--productive term "detente" is deliberate. Just as  all mankind was on the verge of the apocalypse for a long time  during the cold war years, now the Russian and Ukrainian people  have been driven to the point of suicide and are being urged to  take the fatal step, and if the blockheads endowed with  political and spiritual authority manage to cross this line,  only the blind, deaf, and mute can expect this to remain a  regional conflict, like those tormenting the Caucasus, Central  Asia, and Moldova. The whole explanation can be found in the  single word "Chernobyl."    The main prerequisites for this dialogue, which will be  truly  pivotal for all of us, are sincerity, honesty, and goodwill. We  will leave the propagandistic intimidation and nerve-gas methods  to the honored veterans of psychological warfare against  decadent capitalism and their highly enlightened disciples, who  did not manage to achieve worldwide fame before 24 August 1991  and are now selling their erudition to the same warring parties  within the boundaries of yesterday's empire. You and I cannot  immediately pacify Ostankino or the chauvinistic newspapers and  other mouthpieces of the warmongers, who are now calling for  Russo-Ukrainian war instead of world war and are certain to  engender equally radical forces of armed resistance in Ukraine.  You and I, even if we were able to find a common language right  away, could not quickly bring the hard-nosed experts back to  their senses, not to mention the excessively passionate and  belligerent deputies who already see the expanses to the north  and south of the town of Mikhaylovskoye as a theater of military  operations. Nevertheless, just as common sense once began  building bridges, quietly and imperceptibly, across the abyss  between East and West to the accompaniment of the usual  propaganda crossfire and volleys, now we must begin laying the  foundation for the normal, just, peaceful, and mutually  beneficial coexistence of the Russian and Ukrainian people,  which will be just as essential to the survival of all of us  within the territory of the former USSR as the mutual  understanding between Moscow and Washington was essential to  global detente in the recent past. That is why I would define  Russo-Ukrainian relations as the decisive factor at this time. I  am not an economist, political scientist, or diplomat, but I am  certain that the deep inner feelings of the nation, or at least  of its ruling elite--feelings that might be described as its  emotional state--are making their way into these specific  spheres and are influencing each of these spheres in their own  way. It is the state of our emotions, as the primary factor in  Russo-Ukrainian relations, that I will be discussing.    I do not want each of my theses to be taken solely as an  indictment of the other side or an insult to anyone's  self-esteem, or to be interpreted as a final and inflexible  position brooking no evolution or reconsideration. I think that  we are all ready to regard the expression of a different point  of view, even an opposite one, not as the erection of  fortifications for attack or defense or for the seizure of  commanding heights and bridgeheads, but as the removal of  existing obstacles and barriers impeding fraternization.    Here are a few of the theses aimed at this kind of mutual  understanding.    The first thesis is that we Ukrainians have to understand  the  Russians, who grew accustomed to calling themselves nothing less  than Great Russians for a century or two. Actually, it makes no  difference whether they had good reason to call themselves this  or were mere pretenders. The meaning with which they invested  this title is also unimportant. We simply have to realize that  Russia did show the world its potential for large-scale, and  even global expansionism for several centuries, until it had  completely exhausted itself and the nations it had conquered and  was forced to retreat from all continents, back to the borders  of the enfeebled empire, under the pressure of the  unquestionably stronger force of the rest of mankind, the world  community, and not just the West.    We are firmly convinced that Russia will never be an empire  again: Anything else would contradict all of the known natural  tendencies in the progression of historical events and the  biographies of all empires. We are not capable, however, of  communicating this knowledge to not only the Russian hawks and  eagles, not only the Russian super-nationalist crusaders, but  even the average Russian--yesterday's Great Russian.  Furthermore, our references to this obvious historical fact  might only complicate the Russians' own acknowledgement of this  fact. Sooner or later the Russians will realize this themselves:  In the final analysis, there has never been a nation that  completely lost its ability to judge its own behavior accurately  and change it in response to cardinal changes in the basic  circumstances of its existence. We have to be patient, tactful,  considerate, and kind. We also have to be active participants in  dialogue, however, because we are fated to be neighbors. Our  activities have to take the form of confessions rather than  sermons. We have to teach the Russians as much as we can about  ourselves instead of telling them about themselves. Regrettably,  they know virtually nothing about the Ukrainian soul, although  they have always called their own soul enigmatic, and they still  believe this. It is possible that we also do not know everything  about ourselves, but it would be useful to inform the Russians  now and then that the Ukrainians will never accept the myth of  the "thousand-year Russian state"--the myth that the Ukrainians  are not a nation, that the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev can  belong to the state-controlled Moscow Church forever, and that  our 700-year struggle for the restoration of our own state has  been the result of the whims of nationalists, who for some  reason have passed their ideas down to each new generation, no  matter how much they have been violated and eradicated by all  barbarous and "civilized" methods. This is not an invocation:  These are the facts of Ukrainian history, which became,  regrettably, the facts of Russian history as well.    I will not mention the fact that half of the Ukrainian  nationality was exterminated by Moscow during just the Soviet  period: Convincing proof of this was presented at the recent  "Famine-33" international science conference in Kiev. We invite  thinking Russians to take a closer look at the tendencies in the  development of Ukrainian-Russian coexistence, and not just  Russia's present superiority in terms of brute military force  and economic strength. The Ukrainophobes are right: 90 percent  of the feelings expressed on 1 December 1991 were signs of  Khmelnitskiy-ism, Mazepa-ism, Petlyura-ism, and Bandera-ism (I  am deliberately using these Russian ideological cliches). This  means that in spite of all defeats and retreats, the will of  Ukrainians to establish themselves as a nation on the land of  their thousand-year-old ancestors will never be broken. It will  be extinguished only when the last Ukrainian dies. The new  Russian leaders' encouragement of our people to achieve this  goal will obviously depend on the consequences they foresee for  the Russian people. The historical precedents of the Aztecs, the  Mayans, the North American Indians, the Australian Aborigines,  or Russia's own Northern nationalities belong to other times and  other states of human civilization and should not concern even  the patriots of the old Russia. These mass sacrifices of some  ethnic groups on the altars of others can no longer serve as an  alibi for today's champions of old traditions. Furthermore, the  Ukrainian nationality is a special case: No one could destroy it  even in the 750 years it had to live without a state of its own,  even in the brutal barbarian ages. A holocaust against the  Ukrainian nationality is not a realistic or predictable stage of  Russian history. Just look at how the body of Russia is already  being devoured by Moscow's ancien-regime reaction to the  attitudes of Tatarstan or Chechnya, turning healthy processes in  these regions into dangerously unhealthy ones.    Even the general public in Ukraine has heard of some of the  analytical recommendations Russian strategists have made with  regard to policy toward Ukraine: The memorable notes of Vladimir  Lukin are a good example. It is clear that these were only  fragments, metaphorically speaking, of something like a Russian  "Barbarossa Plan" for Ukraine, the rough draft of an Anschluss.  We have to let the Russian politicians and experts know that, in  spite of all their secret codes, hostile intentions of this kind  cannot fail to evoke the appropriate reaction in the Ukrainian  mind. Even if these official and unofficial Russian state  secrets were to be guarded more closely than they are today,  Russia's political practice of weakening and eradicating  Ukrainian independence in every way possible is sowing the seeds  of resentment in the souls of millions of citizens and  demoralizing millions of Russians.    Ukraine is defending itself. It is not doing this to the  fullest extent yet, but I simply want to point out the fact that  anyone defending his honor and dignity and his right to exist is  always in a position of moral superiority to those who infringe  them. These feelings are familiar to the Russians themselves,  and they were instrumental in shaping their patriotism--from the  battles of Kulikovo and Lake Chudskoye to those of Borodino and  Stalingrad. Perhaps this simple reminder will help them  understand the contemporary origins of Ukrainian patriotism.    Here is the second thesis: The Russians might be interested  in knowing that foreigners regard the Kremlin dreamers' emphasis  on the so-called Russian-speaking population as a disastrous  form of self-deception. They see it as an unscientific and  adventuristic notion--and, consequently, as just another utopia.  This can be judged from the heightened activity of the Ukrainian  communities in Russia and other CIS countries, representatives  of which are in frequent contact with us. We are not encouraging  our fellow-countrymen from nearby foreign countries to remember  the shocking recent horrors of their de-Ukrainization and the  disdain for all of their human rights and liberties as long as  they had the courage to remain Ukrainian. The elements of  apartheid and national segregation that were used against them  are common knowledge. I simply want to say something about the  ineradicable features of national identity, and not only in the  Ukrainians: Canadians do not cease to be Canadian, regardless of  whether they speak French or English. Africans or Indians do not  become French or English simply on linguistic grounds. The  imaginary successes of Russophile propaganda--in east Ukraine,  for example--are transparent when they have to serve as the  basis for the strategy of the territorial segmentation of our  state along linguistic lines. In short, I am advising  consideration of the effects of today's actions on Ukraine and  on Russia. All of us are aware of the value of the euphoria of  public rallies and the speed with which these attitudes can  change, and we are also aware, on the other hand, of the staying  power of the fundamental qualities and characteristics of ethnic  communities. In view of the fact that the Ukrainian-Russians  already Russified the northern principalities and now have no  intention whatsoever of Ukrainizing Russia, we have the right  and obligation to let everyone know that Russia will never  conquer Ukraine. It will only defeat itself by arousing  Ukrainian resistance. This is something we do not want.    We can and must discuss some of the other illusions that are  engendered, like nightmares, when the intellect is dozing. We  can and must speak of the political games that are being played  with the various "zones"--economic, informational, etc.--that  are compounding hypocrisy and fraud and, consequently, their own  futility. This applies to the efforts to disguise expansionism  first as internationalism, then as integration, and then as  other developments described in "Latin" terms, with which they  are unpatriotically violating the great Russian language,  because it obviously does not contain enough insidious  euphemisms. My third thesis is that we must not confine  ourselves to phantom-terms in the hope of deceiving one another.  People usually fall prey to the very mythology they invent for  export. One of the latest examples of this was the global  self-deception and self-blinding of the omnipotent CPSU.    Here is my last thesis: There is still time to stop the  Russo-Ukrainian arms race, still time to begin mutual  psychological, political, and every other kind of disarmament.  We realize that thousands of qualified experts on Nicaragua,  Cuba, Angola, and Afghanistan are now unoccupied in Moscow's  many institutes, and they have a strong subjective wish to  exonerate themselves for the failures on all continents by  turning their attention to their fraternal neighbors. But would  it not be better to put the rich organizational, procedural,  diplomatic, and other experience Moscow accumulated in the talks  with Washington to good use along the Moscow-Kiev axis? After  all, it is unlikely that any of us can find a reasonable  explanation for today's absolutely unanticipated reversal: The  new Russia is cultivating a sincere friendship with America and  is constantly fighting with Ukraine.

headline:    Ukraine Seen as Moving Under Russia's Influence 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Myroslav Levytskyy: "Kiev's Optimists!? A   Political Commentary"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted]    Official Kiev's optimism manifested itself in yet another  aspect. In the leading circles of the Ukrainian Supreme Council  a RESPUBLIKA correspondent was informed that the question of  Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty (DNYaZ) would not be taken up by the Ukrainian parliament  in the immediate future. Consideration of this question has to  be postponed until such time as Ukraine is accorded specific  security guarantees. Would this take place any more rapidly than  the dismantling of our technically obsolete missiles?    The president of Ukraine has also said already that this  question will not be brought up for consideration by the present  parliament. He did not, however, indicate the reasons why this  was being postponed.    Could it be that the United States, changing its attitude  toward Ukraine, has come to understand that the retention of  nuclear warheads and the ratification of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty constitutes a logical and political  absurdity? However, there is little hope of such a change in  attitude. During the telephone conversation which took place  between the presidents of Ukraine and the United States on 18  February Clinton again insisted upon Ukraine's becoming a party  to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.    But what then about the promises of security guarantees? Is  anybody in a hurry to accord them to Ukraine? All the more so  when it would involve making uniquivocal moves in international  policy? It was important for Ukraine to be made a part of the  program entitled "Partnership for Peace": this was a display of  trust in Ukraine on the part of the NATO members. As a member of  this partnership, Ukraine adopted the Russian viewpoint with  regard to the Serbian problem. Nowadays, after the withdrawal of  Serbian troops from the frontline, it is still too early to  assess the correctness or incorrectness of the Ukrainian stance  on this matter. The Russian peace initiatives and actions in  Abkhazia ended with the drama of the Georgian state. Ukrainian  politicians are seeking answers to the question of what lies  behind the fact that the Serbs believed only the Russians. All  the more so in that Russia's presidential adviser--on the  occasion of the new situation in the Balkans--made the following  statement: "We need to be able to persuade people and know how  to take advantage of the opportune moment."    In this situation Western commentators traditionally  consider  the Russians' diplomatic mission as a triumph, while expressing  great surprise at the stance taken by Ukraine. The latter's  democratic politicians have emphatically proclaimed that in  foreign policy we must uneqivocally pose the matter as follows:  "Either national interests or old-time sentiments!"    This matter has gained new urgency since the reasons for the  "Russian diplomatic triumph" have been figured out. Situations  sometimes occur whereby military people reveal that which the  diplomats have striven so zealously and long to conceal. On 19  February a certain Russian general in an interview for the  Ostankino Televison Company said the following straight out: "If  NATO intervenes in a sphere of influence which is not theirs,  unforeseen consequences could result." He thereby emphatically  asserted for the umpteenth time that the world is divided into  zones of influence.    And so it turns out that the prolonged war in the Balkans is  a consequence of the above-mentioned division. If decisiveness  and determination had been shown, this military conflagration on  the territory of the former Yugoslavia could have been  extinguished long ago. When matters started to turn threatening  for certain NATO members (Greece and Turkey), this organization  showed firmness. Tens of thousands of victime did not constitute  a sufficient argument to intervene in someone else's zone.    All this sheds new light on the question of according  security guarantees to Ukraine. At one of his November 1993  press conferences former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma said that  Ukraine belongs to the Russian zone. Therefore, the doubts of  certain Western journalists regarding the genuineness of the  security guarantees intended for Ukraine are not groundless or  unjustified.

headline:    Envoy on Russia Relations, Crimea 
text:  Language:   Ukrainian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's   ambassador to the Russian Federation, by Ihor Hrushko, under the  rubric "Politics"; place and date not given: "Volodymyr  Kryzhanivskyy: `Let Us Look for the Things That Bring Us Closer  Together'"]    [Text]  <H5>  Guest Seat </H5>   At a time of historic upheavals, when traditional  perceptions have proven false and when the "older brothers" are  only slowly beginning to understand that their "younger  brothers" have become their equals, it is very difficult for  these same "older brothers" to rid themselves of deeply rooted  stereotypes. For those who do not believe this, we offer the  following interview given to HOLOS UKRAYINY's correspondent by  People's Deputy Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's Ambassador  Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Russian Federation. The  first question put to the ambassador concerned what is probably  the most important issue of today: When will a new Friendship  and Cooperation Treaty at last be signed to replace the old  agreement signed back in 1990? For this document will determine  how these two neighboring countries will live with each another  for many years to come.    [Kryzhanivskyy] Ukraine is interested in signing this  document as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we now sense a  certain tendency on the part of the Russians to hold up the  talks. Why? In my opinion, the reason for this is that this  intergovernmental treaty will have to "dot all the i's" once and  for all on certain issues that the Russian side is striving to  hold in a "preserved" state.    Above all, this applies to the Crimea. Because this question  will have to be settled in a definitive fashion. Dual  citizenship is another issue. I might add that the latter is a  contrived issue, despite the fact that it is being trumpeted  very actively by Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev and other  representatives of Russia's political circles. President N.  Nazarbayev properly proposed introducing the concept of  "postponed citizenship." In other words, an individual who  leaves Kazakhstan, for example, to take up permanent residence  in the Russian Federation becomes a Russian citizen. And  vice-versa. A normal solution to the problem, you would think.  But no, some people in Moscow are very much opposed to this.  President N. Nazarbayev cited the example of the Sudeten Germans  on the eve of the Second World War. Their rights had to be  protected no matter what... And Czechoslovakia was the first to  be brought to her knees.    [Hrushko] The declaration signed by the three presidents  relieved the tension surrounding the nuclear weapons located in  Ukraine. However, many analysts believe that now Russia has to  take some concrete steps with respect to the entire package of  agreements -- in particular, provide us with security  guarantees. Is Moscow prepared to do so?    [Kryzhanivskyy] This question is still being "mulled over"  inside the Russian Federation's presidential structures. There  are indications of a certain unwillingness and of an attempt to  delay matters. Even though Russia would benefit most by this. I  believe that if it received a specific document, the Ukrainian  parliament even in its present make-up would finally settle the  issue of Ukraine's becoming a party to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty.    But so far there has been no anwer. It seems that it suits  someone in the capital of the Russian Federation to portray  Ukraine as recalcitrant and obstinate.    We see further evidence of this in the "invitation" that the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued to Ukraine's  ambassador on 9 February. It is customary in diplomatic practice  to summon ambassadors only in extraordinary circumstances, when  the situation involves something very urgent. Yet when I arrived  at the Foreign Ministry, they expressed their concern to me  about an alleged recent increase in instances of desecration in  Ukraine of monuments supposedly associated with Russian history.    [Hrushko] I have not heard of anything of this sort  happening  recently...    [Kryzhanivsky] Neither have I. They informed me of three  incidents from the "remote past." The first had occurred in  1991. You recall that some disgraceful signs had been posted  near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Kiev. This was an old  affair, possibly even one that had been masterminded by  Kryuchkov's people. The second case dated to the same time --  the incident in which the memorial plaque on the N. Bulgakov  Museum was splattered with paint. And the third, which happened  half a year ago, was the destruction of the bust of M. Kuznetsov  in Rivne Oblast. I regarded this act as absolutely inappropriate  and senseless.    [Hrushko] What, in your opinion, was the reason for this  diplomatic demarche?    [Kryzhanivskyy] One senses that it was largely a calculated  move. Of the 25 million Russians that need to be "protected," 12  million live in Ukraine. But to the great chagrin of some  Russian politicians, nobody is insulting these people, nobody is  oppressing their national feelings or their civil rights. In the  absence of facts, it is necessary to concoct something in order  to persuade the world that Ukraine is uncivilized. This, despite  the fact that the Ukrainian public at large expressed strong  indignation regarding the acts of vandalism that I described  above.    [Hrushko] Another stumbling block in our bilateral relations  is the Black Sea Fleet.    [Kryzhanivskyy] Yes, the problem with respect to the fleet  is  not an easy one. Even though this problem is not at the top of  the agenda at this time. The Russians are in no hurry to settle  this matter. They are obviously planning to approach it from  different angle after the election of Yu. Meshkov. And his  position is clear: the fleet must go to Russia. This is one side  of the issue. On the other side, we have the Trilateral  Declaration, a very important event that put off the resolution  of this question for a while.    In my view, our defense minister, General Radetskyy, "dotted  all the i's" very clearly. I have in mind the procedure for  dividing up the Black Sea Fleet: first we inventory it, perhaps  even reduce it, and then we divide it up. So far, Russia has not  agreed to this and is biding her time.    [Hrushko] The problem of the fleet is closely linked with  the  problem of the Crimea as a whole, especially following the  presidential election on the peninsula. Upon his return from  Moscow, where he met with influential politicians, Yu. Meshkov  began talking of billions and of a ruble zone...    [Kryzhanivskyy] He did meet with S. Shakhray, V. Shumeyko,  and Mr. Ryurikov, the President's aide for international  relations. I see nothing wrong in this. For example, should the  prime minister of Tatarstan visit Kiev, let him meet with  influential people. However, it is premature to speak of money,  especially 50 billion for the resettlement of the Crimean  Tatars. Yu. Meshkov expressed this request. But this is a long  way off from actually receiving the money. The same applies to  the ruble zone. I do not believe that Russia will agree quite so  readily to set up an "aerodynamic pipeline" through which to  pump out its currency. Recall the example of Kazakhstan.    In other words, Yu. Meshkov met with people, they got to  know  him, but with very little in the way of specific results for him.    [Hrushko] Did the Crimean president visit the Ukrainian  Embassy?    [Kryzhanivskyy] No. Perhaps he waited for us to invite him,  or, what is more likely, someone advised him not to visit us.  Still, I eventually spoke to him over the telephone.  Incidentally, we spoke in Ukrainian. I hope that on his next  visit, Mr. Meshkov will visit us, recognizing that the Embassy  of Ukraine is also his embassy. We will always be of assistance  to the Crimea, just as we are to other regions of our country.  [Hrushko] Do you think that we can now speak of an official  position or policy of the Russian Federation with respect to the  Crimea?    [Kryzhanivskyy] The ink has not yet dried on the signatures  placed by the three presidents on the joint declaration.  Consequently, the Russian side's official position is that the  Crimea is Ukraine's internal affair. But there are influential  people in Moscow who would very much like Ukraine to resolve the  Crimean problem according to the principle described by Ilf and  Petrov: "on a saucer with a blue border" [i.e., in very elegant  fashion]. In other words, Kiev gives its approval for a  referendum, following which Crimea becomes independent, and then  as a subject of international law, it speaks of becoming part of  Russia.    Mr. Meshkov, however, is not raising this issue. Because he  is fully aware that this would constitute an anti-constitutional  act directed at undermining Ukraine's territorial integrity,  which would provoke an appropriate response from Kiev and the  world community.    [Hrushko] In the era of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian  Permanent Mission to Moscow served as channel through which the  Kremlin's big bosses sometimes relayed instructions to their  subjects in Kiev. Thank God, the times have changed. A  full-fledged Ukrainian embassy has now been working in Moscow  for more than a year. In your opinion, what are the embassy's  principal tasks?    [Kryzhanivskyy] It is too early to talk of a full-fledged  embassy. We are short of diplomats and short of housing. Of  course, we have had some tangible accomplishments in our work.  But we could have done a lot more if we had enough people. I am  not talking about swelling the embassy staff. But Russia ranks  number one in importance for us. We must therefore do everything  in our power to ensure that the work of this embassy is  productive.    With respect to tasks. Our most important task is to  maintain  close bilateral economic relations. Our two states need to hold  talks constantly. It is essential for us to follow and  understand the complex processes taking place in Russian society  and to be able to foresee the Russian Federation's policy  towards Ukraine.    And, naturally, to disseminate true, undistorted information  about our country in Russia. We all read the Russian press and  watch Russian television. They carry nothing but negative  information about Ukraine. Many Russians have absolutely no idea  what is actually happening in our country.    There are a great number of problems both in our country and  in Russia; life is very hard for the people. But looking only  for the things that divide us will lead us to nowhere. Instead,  we should look for the best in each other, look for the things  that bring us closer together and unite us.    [Hrushko] Thank you for this interview.

headline:    Writer Bykov Comments on Political Situation 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with Vasil Bykov by G. Kovalskaya; place and date   not given: "Our Times Call for Shushkevich"]    [Text] Exclusive interview with a classical writer of  Belarusian literature dealing with the independence of Belarus,  chances of the People's Front and the resignation of Shushkevich.    There is no need to identify Vasil Bykov for the readers.  The  great Belarus author was known both in the former USSR as well  as throughout the world. Not everyone, however, knows something  else: many of the books by this author first saw the light of  day in the Russian language (even though Bykov thinks and writes  in Belarusian) simply because they could not be published in the  author's homeland. Even during Soviet times ideological dictates  and censorship that existed in Belarus were more rigid than in  other republics.    It is too early to speak of freedom of creativity there at  present as well. The trial of writer Svetlana Aleksiyevich, who  published a book titled "The Zinc Boys" about the Afghanistan  war, for instance, a trial which is of a distinctly political  character, is still under way in Minsk.    Despite that, Vasil Bykov, an artist who has been striving  for freedom all of his life, is not thinking of abandoning his  native land by contrast with many of his colleagues, who, by the  way, are not condemned by him but whose departure he regrets  deeply. What does the author like and dislike in the Belarus of  today? What are his political preferences? How does he visualize  the Belarusian path into the world?    Our observer Galina Kovalskaya spoke with Vasil Bykov.    [Kovalskaya] Why is the issue concerning national  independence of the republic of Belarus again one of the most  hotly disputed ones? It would appear that it is an issue  resolved a long time ago: first in September 1991, when the  Supreme Council of the republic proclaimed independence, then at  Belovezhskaya Pushcha, when three of the former Soviet republics  reiterated the disintegration of the USSR with their agreement.    [Bykov] State sovereignty is an unambiguous term that does  not lend itself to any kind of reinterpretation. Either it  exists or it does not. In my opinion state independence benefits  the people because, as indicated by historical experience, the  welfare of the people is directly associated with the existence  of their own state. Naturally, we are not speaking of any  isolation from the outside world, but merely about political and  national independence.    Independence came to Belarus somewhat unexpectedly. All of  its preceding history, it would appear, prodded us in the  opposite direction, toward full integration, first with the  Polish state, then with the Russian empire. When it became  necessary to ensure independence politically, economically, and  culturally it turned out that our society and its ruling class  were not prepared to do that.    The principal difficulty consisted of the fact that  communists dominated all of our power structures, at all levels.  I know that in some places in Transcaucasia and in Central Asia  communists attempted to somehow adapt to the national movement  or even to head it. In our case the communists unequivocally  favor the empire and continue to be the main anti-populist force.    Barely recovering from the August 1991 putsch and  Belovezhskaya Pushcha, the "party in power" initiated a  struggle, first for the total rehabilitation and restoration of  the power of the Communist Party, and then for the restoration  of the empire. It has now become particularly animated as the  imperial forces raise their voices in Russia.    [Kovalskaya] Are you against the entry of Belarus in the  ruble zone?    [Bykov] Our directorial corps is strongly in favor of that,  stating that it promises all kinds of economic advantages. In  reality our directors know how to work only under conditions of  a command and specifically an all-union economy because of which  for them a return to a unified economic system is undoubtedly  beneficial. I, however, believe that this would be another step  toward the liquidation of Belarus independence.    Among Russian economists there is also not a single one with  an opinion on that. It seems that Chernomyrdin, and possibly the  president of Russia, are prepared to incur some economic losses,  including an increase in the inflation rate, for the sake of  political goals--retention of Belarus within the Russian sphere  of influence.    [Kovalskaya] What political forces in Belarus do you feel  closest to? Who will you vote for in the elections?    [Bykov] We have a plethora of parties. In reality, however,  the entire political spectrum in our case is black-and-white or,  if you will, red-and-white. On one side there are the communist,  imperial, and anti-national forces, while on the other side  there are national forces. The Belarusian People's Front has  real influence among those who are defending the ideals of  national and state independence. Unfortunately it is represented  poorly in the leadership of the country--its faction in the  Supreme Council is very small, while in the executive power  branch it has no followers at all.    The other parties--the Christian-Democratic Party, the  Social-Democratic Party, and the Peasant Party are quite small  and not influential. Even though they too proclaim themselves as  proponents of Belarusian independence.    I am, of course, on the side of forces of independence. As  far as the elections are concerned, I must confess that I do not  believe not only in the possibility of early elections, but even  in the presumption that our Supreme Council will go along with  elections at the time stipulated by law. Our "party in power" is  intently watching changes taking place in Russia and is becoming  increasingly convinced that for it there is no need to hurry  with any changes since there is a chance that everything will go  back to the way it was. If the elections are held, however, I  will certainly vote for the People's Front.    [Kovalskaya] How about in the presidential election?    [Bykov] For Poznyak, if he will be on the ballot.    [Kovalskaya] But after all Poznyak is not fair and even  insulting in his anti-Russian utterances. Inasmuch as I was able  to notice, many in the People's Front leadership not only do not  share those views but are even embarrassed by them.    [Bykov] It was specifically Poznyak who created the People's  Front and prevented its split. Yes, many of his positions are  simply shocking. But at the same time it is hard to argue with  him: he has experience, both of historical and simply human  kind. He wrote his well-known article on Russian imperial  consciousness and imperial policy before the New Year. Only a  short period of time passed and it turned out to be downright  prophetic: some statements were made by Kozyrev regarding "the  sphere of vital Russian in the near abroad," and he asserted  that troops should not be withdrawn from there--all of which  disturbed both us and the West.    Aggressive nationalism in the republics is whipped up by  such  imperial reasoning and is sometimes engendered by it. That is  understood by many but most try not to talk about it. Poznyak,  however, is not such a person. Even before the disintegration of  the USSR, when the CPSU Central Committee managed everything, he  forcefully took some television air time with his comrades and  reaching all of Belarus stated that the Communist Party is a  criminal organization. He was not silent when all others were.  That is the kind of man he is.    Certainly he is a radical, but in contemporary life there is  no room for a centrist position: all politicians gravitate  either toward one, the communist, or the other, national, fringe.    [Kovalskaya] What about Shushkevich?    [Bykov] Shushkevich is a tragic figure. It was specifically  his attempts to be "a centrist" that played a bad joke on him  and led to political failure. He is an honest, clever, and an  intelligent individual, dedicated to democratic ideals, but  apparently, not for our times. Our times call for Poznyak.    [Kovalskaya] Why did the Belarusian People's Front never  become for Belarusia what Sajudis was for Lithuania, Rukh for  Ukraine, and Democratic Russia for Russia, failing to become a  mass-scale popular movement?    [Bykov] National self-consciousness is insufficiently  developed and political culture is lacking. Particularly in view  of the fact that as living standards deteriorate at present, the  myth that supposedly "under the communists things were better"  is gaining strength.    In my opinion another myth, which is gaining currency in  Russia as well, is that people are purportedly too politicized  and all they do is attend meetings. It would be better if things  were like they are in the developed countries where no one cares  about the government at all. All this is fabricated by the  authorities for the purpose of self-preservation. In actuality  the population in its absolute majority has no idea at all about  democratic values, it is not accepting the idea of democracy,  and does not comprehend the basics of a market society.    [Kovalskaya] What do you think is the solution?    [Bykov] It is quite evident: the economic system must be  changed. But that is impossible without a radical political  reform and especially without a consolidation of national  statehood. We have already fully partaken of the pleasures of a  totalitarian empire. In addition to that there is also the  European experience of national state building.    Even closer there is the experience of our neighbors. Yes,  nothing is so far working out in Ukraine--the power there,  however, remains in the hands of the same communists. While in  the Baltic states the reform is proceeding with difficulty but  successfully even though there are more objective difficulties  over there than there are in our case: there is also the lack of  local energy resources, and in general they are poorer with  regard to resources than we are. They also lack the advantages  of our geographical position. In addition to that there is the  nationality factor which, fortunately, will not appear in our  case unless someone makes a special effort to that end.    [Kovalskaya] That is not exactly what I mean--it is  understood where we should be moving. I asked how you would  prefer to get out of the current dead-end situation, taking into  account that you have your Belarusian and not a Lithuanian  population, and neither Yeltsin nor Gaidar are at the top, but  your own leadership.    [Bykov] With our leadership we will not be moving anywhere.  With it the only possibility is to turn back. Even if we do go  back we shall find not the communist past, but ruins.    What can be done, you ask? It is necessary to struggle, of  course, conduct political education. We can be saved only by a  popular movement.    Do you remember the late Alex Adamovich once stating that  Belarus is the Vendee of reconstruction? Recently he further  added that we are changing into a peculiar kind of a communist  Paraguay: all the communists unsuited to the new life are coming  to us from everywhere. In our country they are living not just  on their personal pension but are working very actively.    Democracy is inevitable. But the price it may be necessary  for Belarusia to pay for it could be very high. The fact that it  will be higher than in the Baltic states is without doubt. I do  not know if it will be higher than in Russia. I fear that Russia  is yet to pay its price and it is not known what it will amount  to.    [Kovalskaya] Whom do you favor most from among the Russian  politicians?    [Bykov] After all, we are selecting from what exists. Of  course, Gaidar's group, those linked with reform and democracy.

headline:    Popular Movement Leader Views Current Issues 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Belarusian Popular Movement Chairman Sergey   Gaydukevich by Igor Gukovskiy; place and date not given: "We  Did Not Displace Stanislav Shushkevich"]    [Excerpts] At first glance, the Belarusian Popular Movement  [NDB] -- this colossal political force with more than half a  million members -- seems to have appeared out of nowhere. But  this is not true. The explanation is simple -- two years ago,  large organizations, such as the Communist Party of Belarus, the  Slavic Assembly "White Russia," the Foundation of the  Servicemen's Social Protection, and some others, decided to  merge. As was reported at the time, the purpose of that move  was to coordinate efforts intended to consolidate society. That  unification went practically unnoticed for its opponents, who  were then reveling in their victories in the battle for  "restoration" [previous word in Belarusian]. The title  "Belarusian Popular Movement" was certainly selected as an  opposition to the Popular Front, which monopolized the right to  speak on behalf of the people.    Soon, other organizations joined the NDB. The movement  gained in strength, while the Popular Front clearly  disintegrated, letting go an increasing number of "factions"  that joined small parties. The Popular Front's fate also befell  other so called democratic organizations -- the United  Democratic Party of Belarus, the Belarusian Christian Democratic  Association, DDRB [Movement for Democratic Reforms in Belarus]  -- debilitated as a result of internal strife.    At present, the NDB is undoubtedly the largest and most  influential political bloc. Our correspondent met with its  leader, Sergey Gaydukevich.    [Gukovskiy] Behind the resignation of Stanislav Shushkevich,  many see the efforts of the NDB...    [Gaydukevich] This is not exactly true. There were a lot  more votes against the legislative speaker than the NDB actually  had (three factions -- "union," communists, and veterans). At  the same time, I am not going to diminish the role of our  organization, which consistently spoke for Shushkevich's  resignation.    [Gukovskiy] What was it that you did not like about him?    [Gaydukevich] He made no resolute decisions over the past  half a year.    I would not like to speak about him as a person. However, as  a politician, he proved very weak, dependent, and hesitant. He  has not managed to establish his position on many issues -- the  collective security treaty, economic integration with Russia,  the ruble zone, or any other key issues. His haphazard policies  led the parliament's operations to a deadlock. His continued  service in office would have exacerbated the situation, creating  more animosity among factions, groupings, etc. [passage omitted]    [Gukovskiy] You accuse the former legislative speaker of  seeking an illusory accord, vague directions, unclear positions.  However, the present head of the legislature, right after his  election to the post, declared that the previous course of  Belarus will be continued and that he would seek support without  giving preference to any grouping.    [Gaydukevich] Nevertheless, the difference between  Shushkevich and Hryb is profound. The latter has clearly and  unequivocally stated that he is for close relations with Russia  -- Shushkevich just timidly mentioned the need to maintain links  with it -- for the ruble zone, expanding economic ties, the  collective security treaty. He said that he supported the  course of the Belarusian Government. In other words, the man  determined his position and spoke out on it immediately after  his election.    In all his time as legislative speaker, Shushkevich never  did  anything like that. Nobody could understand him. At times, he  declared that he is a strong supporter of close ties with  Russia, and at other times, in an interview or during a  conversation with some oppositionist, he would make assurances  that he is a staunch advocate of Belarusian independence. When  the collective security issue was debated, Stanislav Shushkevich  gave plenty of interviews that did not help, however, to flesh  out his true opinions. It was not by coincidence that even part  of the opposition voted against him. Toward the end of his  term, he lost support of not only the legislative majority but  also that of the opposition. The most regrettable thing is that  the people did not get a chance to know what kind of Belarus  Shushkevich wanted to see.    Like Gorbachev, Shushkevich attempted to sit on several  chairs at a time. A seasoned card player, he wanted to play  with everyone. But every game is played by its own rules and a  clearly specified number of players.    If Shushkevich had had political convictions, he would have  certainly found allies in parliament. It takes some talent to  find no support in a legislature swarming with numerous factions!    [Gukovskiy] Do you think Shushkevich will return to big  politics, as is predicted by many political observers, including  Russian ones?    [Gaydukevich] Never. That is the "Gorbachev-2" case. There  were many predictions after the resignation of the first, and  the last, Soviet president. Unfortunately, you will get nowhere  in politics without a clear program and position.    [Gukovskiy] The NDB, the largest legislative grouping, did  not propose him as a candidate for president. Why? It was your  best chance to come to power, which the Marxists said is the  chief purpose of political struggle.    [Gaydukevich] We had our candidates, but they declined their  nominations. As for the struggle for power, we remain faithful  to the fundamental idea of our movement -- consolidation. We  were aware of the fact that a speaker from the NDB would have  triggered a real explosion, which would be very divisive and  distracting for the parliament. After discussing Hryb's  candidacy, we came to a conclusion: This is the man who in this  situation suits everyone. He does not want confrontation but is  able to ensure efficient operations of our legislative body.  [passage omitted]    [Gukovskiy] What do you think about the opposition's  proposal  to form a coalition government before calling early elections?    [Gaydukevich] We are against it. The opposition proposed to  dissolve the Supreme Council and give power to a narrow group of  like-minded politicians. The opposition's purpose is clear,  which is to take advantage of the present state of confusion.  Just look at what demands were trotted out by the Popular Front  and the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly [BDSG]. In their  opinion, the coalition government should consist of only the  people who support their ideas. That is absurd! This would  immediately put the parties standing for, say, bilingualism or  collective security out the equation. In other words, the  largest political forces, including the NDB, are automatically  removed from the political scene.    [Gukovskiy] Did NDB representatives meet with Mechyslaw Hryb  after he was elected Supreme Soviet chairman?    [Gaydukevich] No, they did not. I believe that the  initiative to meet should come from Mechyslaw Ivanovich himself.  We have made our move by sending him a telegram with  congratulations on his new appointment. Hryb and Kebich made a  good declaration calling for contacts with all political forces.  All forces! The former speaker has never even thought about  it. He kept saying "accord" [preceding word in Belarusian], but  as far as I can remember, he met only with the BDSG and the  United Democratic Party of Belarus.    [Gukovskiy] You say that early elections are necessary.  When do you think they should be called? Are you sure that  they will take place at all?    [Gaydukevich] I think they will actually take place. The  Supreme Soviet made a relevant decision on this. When?  Summertime is the time of vacations; it cannot be in March or  early April, according to the law, which requires a two-month  waiting period. They cannot be held in April and May, as people  will be busy with the sowing campaign. The most convenient time  would be early fall.    [Gukovskiy] You have repeatedly said that the NDB stands for  closer union with Russia. Just like in Belarus, a variety of  political force are active in that country, including in the  highest echelons of power. With which of them are you seeking a  union?    [Gaydukevich] I have always said: Politicians come and go,  but the people remain. We will cooperate with all those who  stand for the unity of the Slavic peoples. I would rather not  be in position to name specific parties or individuals. Our  position may clear after meetings with representatives of the  entire political spectrum of Russia, which we are planning to  hold as soon as possible.

headline:    Justice Minister on Legal System Reforms 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with Alexei Barbaneagra, minister of justice of   the Republic of Moldova, by V. Dubovoy: place and date not  given: "Poor-Quality Justice Costing the Government Dearly"]    [Text] The process involved in establishment of the  democratic state of Moldova is inconceivable without  reorganization and perfection of the entire judicial and legal  system. Over the past several years a concept for legal reform  was worked out in the republic, and enforceable enactments were  adopted regulating the transformation processes. The  achievements as well as difficulties that have been encountered  were discussed with our correspondent by Alexei Barbaneagra,  minister of justice of the republic of Moldova.    [Dubovoy] Mister Minister, the draft of a concept for  judicial reform in the republic of Moldova was prepared by the  Ministry of Justice, and you personally were one of its  creators. A draft law on judicial and legal reform was likewise  prepared and submitted to parliament for review, but there are  still no results. What is the reason for that?    [Barbaneagra] The situation is indeed the way you described  it. I am not clear as to the reasons why the draft law on legal  reform in the republic of Moldova was not reviewed by the old  parliament. I believe that the new parliament, realizing the  importance attached to the resolution of this question, will  include it in its agenda.    After all, in our opinion legal reform must serve to  guarantee statehood and democracy and the successful advance of  economic transformations, because of which its earliest possible  adoption is necessary.    Thus far republic legal organs continue performing their  functions relying on laws which, unfortunately, have nothing but  a negative effect on the results of our activity.    [Dubovoy] Another year has passed. What was it like for the  judicial organs of the republic and the Ministry of Justice as a  whole?    [Barbaneagra] Over the past year work at the ministry was  aimed at the elaboration of draft laws and enforceable  enactments, submission of conclusions regarding new laws,  systematization of legislation, and the provision of Moldovan  citizens with necessary legal information.    Last year alone personnel of the ministry prepared and  provided conclusions on 1,160 draft enforceable enactments.  Judicial activity deserves particular attention. Last year the  courts handled 12,005 criminal cases, which is 852 cases more  than in 1992, along with some 30,368 civil cases. Practically  all of them were reviewed. So far, however, we are not satisfied  with the activity of rayon and city district courts as there are  frequent cases of delays in the review of cases which leaves  something to be desired with respect to the case review process  itself.    That is why, for the purpose of improving the skill levels  of  judges the ministry organized probationary training at the  Supreme Court in 1993 for 75 young jurists while more than 80  judges underwent professional re-certification.    Unfortunately judges themselves commit violations of the  law,  because of which 12 judges as well as 18 bailiffs were punished  last year for various infractions.    The physical plant at the courts needs strengthening, it is  necessary to provide them with technical means. Computers, Xerox  machines, and other modern technical facilities--all that so far  is only a dream for us.    [Dubovoy] Alexei Afanasyevich. You stated that the judges  also break the law. In this connection how is the law on  languages being enforced by court personnel?    [Barbaneagra] We are monitoring its enforcement and I am  pleased to note that by comparison with 1989, when not a single  sentence was passed in the state language or a ruling given,  last year the majority of sentences (in 63 percent of the  criminal and 52.2 percent of civil cases) were passed in the  courts of Moldova in the Romanian language. That, in turn, means  that judges are making their contribution to the consolidation  of the law on languages.    [Dubovoy] Recently the Ministry of Justice of the republic  of  Moldova established close ties with international legal organs,  institutes, and the like. Which of the contacts are clearly  promoting the expansion of links between jurists of Moldova and  those of other countries while strengthening legal organs in the  republic. What are some of the initial results of such  collaboration?    [Barbaneagra] There is no doubt that we need such contacts  not only for the exchange of views, but also for close  cooperation with international legal organizations which are  manifesting lively interest in all that is taking place within  the republic of Moldova and are helping us with the elaboration  of enforceable enactments, conducting expert reviews of laws  that have already been adopted, and promoting the integration of  our state in the world legal community. Close ties with  representatives of the European Community, the CSCE Mission, the  European Council, the Association of American Lawyers, the For  Democracy Fund, and with others were established.    Our jurists participated in the work of international  symposiums and conferences on legal issues. On more than one  occasion we received invitations from various international  organizations for us to study judicial systems functioning in  different countries.    Recently personnel from our ministry visited Germany, Italy,  and Switzerland where they studied the operation of law  enforcement organs. Experts from international organizations  favored the extension of aid to specialists of Moldova in the  area of law, and the problem concerning training and retraining  of our personnel is being resolved along with the one pertaining  to the provision of courts of the republic with necessary  technical means. We are striving to expand the sphere of such  contacts and to create all possible premises for fruitful  collaboration with jurists in foreign countries to the benefit  of our republic.    [Dubovoy] An important place in the work of the Ministry of  Justice is occupied by the preparation and conclusion of  international agreements on legal aid and legal relations in the  area of civil, criminal and family law. A few words about how  this area of jurisprudence is faring.    [Barbaneagra] The elaboration of such agreements is a  complicated and a laborious matter. As of today Moldova has  signed agreements on legal aid and legal relations in the area  of civil, criminal, and family law with Russia, Ukraine, Latvia,  and Lithuania. In the very near future such agreements will be  concluded with Georgia and Azerbaijan, as well as other  republics of the former USSR.    As far as legal aid for the population is concerned, as a  result of a significant rise in the cost of legal services of  jurists, the citizens of Moldova are reverting to their services  much less frequently which, for understandable reasons, cannot  help but alert us since that, I am assuming, is also a matter of  state policy.    [Dubovoy] What else is of concern to the minister of  justice?    [Barbaneagra] A rise in the crime rate, a certain  pathological lack of respect for existing laws is disturbing.  Democratic transformations in the republic are being hindered by  delays in the adoption of judicial and legal reforms. The  imperfect nature of the legislation and in certain cases its  absence, makes it impossible to resolve many vitally important  problems of society. One would like to believe that many of  today's problems will be resolved and democratic transformations  in the Republic of Moldova will acquire a firm legal basis.    [Dubovoy] Thank you.

headline:    Finance Minister Evaluates National Economy 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with Claudia Melnic, minister of finance of the   Republic of Moldova, by Ivan Koretskiy, under the "Our  Interviews" rubric; place and date not given: "Claudia Melnic:  We Have Destroyed a Lot, Let Us Create"]    [Text]    [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, you have quite a busy  schedule, and due to this our conversation has been postponed a  number of times. Tell me please, what does the minister of  finance and the ministry headed by her work on so intensively?    [Melnic] It so happened that the adoption of documents that  are highly significant for the economy, business life, and the  social sphere occurred at the end of last year and the beginning  of this year. These are entire packages of solutions associated  with the introduction of a national currency, amendments to  laws, and the introduction of excise taxes. Some of them have  already been published in the press in the form of edicts of the  president of Moldova, and the rest are still being worked on.    Unfortunately, the Parliament did not complete its  law-creating activities, and we have to look for a way out of  the situation. The economy must work, and the budget must be  replenished through both production and taxes. Some of the  taxes--on real estate, natural resources, bank profits, and  insurance operations--are already operational. A number of  laws--on the value-added tax, on local taxes--have been  developed and are being considered by the Parliament and the  government. Apparently, they will also be enacted by a  presidential edict in order to be subsequently submitted to the  new Parliament to be discussed and adopted. All of them will  become components of the state tax system. In this manner, we  are trying to lay the foundation of a tax system that would be  in line with the conditions of a market economy and would make  it possible to make mutual relations between the state and  producers, entrepreneurs, and the population stable.    At present, the view exists that our tax system is  oppressive, although international experts evaluate it as being  reasonable. Thus, in the year 1993 the total amount of tax  revenues, including the social fund, is expected to reach 11-12  percent of the gross national product. In 1991, it stood at 38  percent, and in the current year 1994--15-18 percent. Therefore,  a stable tax system is emerging here, and it is beginning to  regulate the process of capital flows and to secure a balance of  sectors and areas of entrepreneurial activities.    [Koretskiy] Madam Minister, you have referred to the  value-added tax. It will affect primarily those to whom we  attach hopes for overcoming the crisis--the producers. A lot  depends on what this tax will be.    [Melnic] Indeed, this is one of the key aspects, and not  just  here, but in the CIS countries--after all, we have all come out  of the same economic system. For now, the value-added tax is not  changing. It should be coordinated with all economic partners.  Unfortunately, this issue was removed from the agenda at a  meeting in Ashgabat, because an agreement on the uniform rate of  the value-added tax in the process of switching to world-market  prices on 1 January 1994 and on arrangements for its collection  could not be reached.    It is not advantageous for the republics to add this tax to  the world-market prices for raw materials, because in this case  the cost of manufactured goods will be higher than world prices.  This means that products will be noncompetitive from the start.  A balanced approach is required of us in this instance.    [Koretskiy] So have we been importing and exporting products  at world-market prices from New Year's day on?    [Melnic] The issue of world-market prices has been resolved.  In the process, we succeeded in defending the interests of the  republic. For example, Russia tried to secure the setting of  world-market prices only for the products that are quoted on the  world market, i.e. oil, electricity, metal, timber. In this  case, it will turn out that nobody needs our tomatoes, even at a  negotiated price. We believe that the right of all CIS countries  to use world-market prices in settlements among themselves is  unshakeable. This is a complicated problem....    However, I would like to go back to your first question and  say that the Ministry of Finance has done a great volume of work  to come up with funds for the additional social protection of  the low-income strata of the population. You know that an edict  on the minimum wage has been issued, and that it is built on a  differentiated approach to various groups of the population.  This is associated with the sharp growth of expenditures for  energy resources. For example, the expenditure of funds for  heating comes to 15-17 lei per person. Meanwhile, the growth of  the average wage is falling behind considerably.    [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, this begs the natural  question: Why do wages never keep up with expenditures? Our  readers are asking in their letters and telephone calls: How is  one to survive in the future, given that a consumer basket costs  80-100 lei, whereas the minimum salary comes to 13 lei?    [Melnic] I would like to note that the welfare of the people  does not hinge on edicts to raise wages. Wage increases  immediately entail quite a tangle of closely intertwined  economic, financial, and political problems. We have put the  state budget together based on the average monthly salary of 15  lei, aiming at smooth quarterly salary raises. Any abrupt leap  amounts to an impulse for inflationary processes and the growth  of prices. For our part, we are trying as best we can to contain  these processes which affect the population adversely.    There have been certain shortcomings in the policy of  remunerations for labor and social welfare. We should inform the  population in advance about the expected price increases, the  rate of inflation, and wage increases. However, we must also  talk about something else. I have here on my desk data on the  average monthly salary for November 1993. For the employees of  state structures, it came to 63.4 lei, transportation  employees--58.7 lei, industry personnel--84.2 lei, and the  employees of the agrarian complex (kolkhozes, sovkhozes)--35.5  lei. This does not include payments in kind. Therefore, a  judgment cannot be formed solely on the basis of the size of the  minimum wage.    Still, our social fund is very weak. The priority task of  both our government and Parliament and those of the future is to  reinforce it, so that the people will feel confident. The people  should be protected.    [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, what is your assessment of  last year?    [Melnic] It was a difficult year, but during the year we  succeeded in the most important endeavor--to keep the peace. Not  everything has yet been settled in mutual relations with the  Dniester area, and the time has come to take measures to resolve  this issue. I think that the new Parliament will be up to that.    Here is another favorable aspect: During the year, our  production smoothly and inconspicuously discontinued its fall  and stabilized, and on some scores we even have increases. We  succeeded in limiting expenditures and containing the growth of  prices compared to other CIS countries. We avoided a crisis in  the budget system and, you will recall, there were no delays in  the payment of wages and funding for expenditures as we had had  before.    The volume of work for our ministry was simply tremendous.  After all, the budget was approved thrice in one year. Besides,  the state succeeded in settling its balance of payments, and now  we can make provisions for financial reserve and conduct  negotiations about credit. The state budget for 1993 was  implemented by 104.3 percent on the revenue side, and the  republic budget--by 101.4 percent.    [Koretskiy] Is it really that everything was good, and no  mistakes or miscalculations of any kind were allowed to occur?    [Melnic] Unfortunately, as early as the beginning of the  year, the government failed correctly to allocate capital  investment. Later, in the middle of the year, we were forced to  "freeze" 600 facilities under construction. We were not always  able correctly to project the rate of inflation, which was  mainly dictated by leaps in the prices for energy resources. We  did not manage to do many things, because of the absence of a  legislative base. As I have said before, we are now making up  for it by way of presidential edicts, so that reforms will not  get bogged down.    There were miscalculations, indeed. For example, we did not  succeed in fully restoring the system for managing the state  sector on a new, market foundation. It is known that the old  system has been completely destroyed. An owner should manage his  property; otherwise, the threat of losing this property will  arise. After all, in the process of privatization the state will  retain about 65 percent of the property, and it is necessary to  manage it wisely in order for the state to be a guarantor of  welfare and the effectiveness of operation of its enterprises on  an equal footing with other owners.    It is also necessary to streamline the system of  remunerations for labor, in order to avoid the tremendous  imbalance whereby at one enterprise they make 20 lei and at  another, 200 lei, with no regard for labor productivity. For the  state sector, we should make the procedures for the distribution  of profits between accumulation and consumption more rigid, so  that enterprises will use their profits for production purposes,  investment, and incentives for production, rather than just  wages. It is possible that we will have to limit wages, say, to  the level of 25 times the minimum wage, that is, set a limit for  remunerations for labor. For example, such restrictions apply in  countries such as Japan and Switzerland. These measures will  become acutely necessary if the economic forms of affecting  consumption produce no results.    [Koretskiy] What were the successes of the year?    [Melnic] Certainly, the adoption of a national currency,  although we did not succeed in including the entire republic.  The Ministry of Finance has always come out for settling  relations with the Dniester area prior to the introduction of  the national currency. A great many problems will now develop.  After all, the people have not severed family, business, or  production relations, and for that reason all of them are now  experiencing great inconvenience. The inconvenience is  associated with elementary payments for all services,  deliveries, and purchases. It appears to me that the authorities  of Tiraspol should take some measures so that the leu will  circulate similarly in the eastern rayons of the Republic of  Moldova, although for them this is also a political issue. After  all, they cannot live on ration cards forever. The currency  should work, and should bring the people closer together.    Last year, we also succeeded in preparing a draft budget for  1994 and in getting it approved ahead of time, prior to 1  January 1994. I will say frankly that the employees of our  ministry and I are very happy about this fact, because a budget  approved before the beginning of the year (for the first time in  the last three years) means stability for all producers,  consumers, and the social infrastructure. It is already clear  which taxes will be levied, where profits will go, and how much  will have to be withheld and for what.    It is possible that the budget for the second half of the  year will have to be updated. Everything will depend on the size  of emission, the growth of prices, and inflation. However, I  will stress that everything depends on ourselves, on the rate of  production, all the more so because the Ministry of Finance will  not receive credit from the National Bank of Moldova this year.  We should cover the deficit in full by issuing securities and  receiving foreign credit.    In general, international credit, support from the World  Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Governments of  the Russian Federation and Romania were very helpful in  overcoming the economic crisis caused by the war and the  drought. With this credit, the government purchased grain,  seeds, fertilizer, spare parts, fuel, and medicines. The  production and social spheres were supported out of them.    [Koretskiy] Perhaps, as a former banker and the current  minister of finance, you, Claudia Vasilyevna, know the saying  about credit which is as old as the hills: You take someone  else's, and you give back yours. How are we going to settle for  the debt? Are we not taking on too much credit?    [Melnic] Of course, it would be better to do without credit.  However, this is not possible in the environment of a  transitional economy. After all, our state, just like the rest  of the CIS countries, is insolvent. Meanwhile, we need to live,  work, turn out products, and buy goods. You will seek credit  whether you like it or not. The terms on which it is received  are another matter. The government has done a lot of work in  this area, so that these outlays will be used wisely and that  the consequence of their use will not place a heavy burden on  our children. I will say that a memorandum on the economic  policy of the state has been signed for 1994. It has been  discussed with international experts and gained approval.  Therefore, our economic policy has been found correct. In  December, the IMF resolved to grant us credit in the form of a  stand-by facility which opens certain prospects in Moldova's  relationship with the rest of the world.    We now need to support production in every way possible,  give  incentives to producers and the structures working to benefit  them. This is a way out of the situation and a guarantee for the  repayment of credit. Why import when it is possible to produce  here, locally, with material, tax, financial, and credit  support? This means an increase in production, an abundance of  goods, new jobs, and the growth of exports. In this case, it  will be easier to settle for credit.    [Koretskiy] Madam Minister, allow me to familiarize you with  one of the numerous letters received by our newspaper and  addressed to the government of which you are a member. In the  letter, a reader complains: "The impoverishment of the people  progresses year after year. For years, the people set aside  their savings at the most reliable bank, the Savings Bank, only  to be left high and dry now. Through the effort of our rulers,  our savings have turned to dust. At present, one cannot buy a  funeral shroud with them, let alone ensure a decent funeral for  himself...."    [Melnic] I must note that these accusations are not leveled  at the real culprits, and I will explain why. The shock therapy  of 1991 blew the savings of the people away like a whirlwind.  The Government of the USSR and our Moldovan Government had a  hand in it. Until 1 January 1992, about 5 billion rubles [R]  were borrowed from the Savings Bank of Moldova with a view to  covering the deficit of the Union budget. By now, this debt has  been fully paid by the government. All arrears on various  compensation payments have also been paid in full. The Ministry  of Finance has also paid in full the value of the state  securities of the former USSR. Therefore, all of our  relationships with the deposits of the population have been  completed.    I believe that indexation should be performed out of the  profits of the Savings Bank, in keeping with the Law on  Indexation. It is the savings banks that administer profits  rather than the state. They charge 200-270 percent in interest  rates on credit, and pay next to nothing to the depositors.  They, the depositors, should demand appropriate payments and  indexation directly from the Savings Bank.    [Koretskiy] Claudia Vasilyevna, you are the only female  minister of the government. Tell us how you handle this burden  of responsibilities.    [Melnic] This is not a job for a woman. You are busy 16-18  hours a day, and then you have a family and children! In  addition, you take work home every evening in order to manage,  and there are no days off.... One needs nerves of steel and  health to endure this.    I have endured because I continuously got support from my  male colleagues. I will say frankly that on occasion I have  abused the fact that I am a woman in resolving significant  issues of principle. However, this is no way out anyway. I hope  that a man will come to this position who will have enough  willpower, persistence, and experience to implement the  financial stabilization policy.    [Koretskiy] Should this be interpreted to say that you are  completing your political career?    [Melnic] I have never considered myself a politician.  Considering myself a specialist--indeed, and then a specialist  of the old school, for whom the words of a song, "Think about  the motherland first, and about yourself next" is the creed of  life.    I came to this position contrary to my own wishes and the  wishes of my loved ones, and solely on the condition that there  would be no more war, and that the government of national accord  would not allow this nightmare to occur.    Despite all the difficulties, this has been a happy and  interesting period in my life. Together with the staff of the  Ministry of Finance, who are capable of moving mountains, we  have managed to accomplish a lot, and this is gratifying.

headline:    Internal Affairs Minister on Crime Growth, Related Issues 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with Constantin Antoci, Lt Gen of Police and   Minister of internal Affairs of the Republic of Moldova,  conducted by Boris Marian and Igor Kondrashkin, time and place  not specified]    [Text]    [Interviewer] A traditional question, mister minister, or  rather a suggestion. Let us summarize the results of the last  year in your department. First the pleasing ones, and leave the  unhappy ones for later.    [Antoci] Permit me to give a somewhat untraditional answer  to  your tradition question about "pleasing results." Needless to  say, there is nothing simpler that to select the very figures  that would satisfy you out of the enormous mass of statistical  data and offer them to the public. But I would like to draw  attention to those details which define the essence of the  criminogenic situation and are fundamental.    The reader should not be intimidated by the significant  number of statistical layouts that we resort to; you can judge  the results of our work by them, and so we cannot get along  without them.    In 1991 the level of crime per 10,000 population was 102.1.  In 1992 it was 90.1. Last year it was 85.1. So we can say with  full certainty that the trend is positive, there is some decline  in the crime rate. All this contradicts the common opinion that  crime is constantly growing in the republic.    One more important aspect is the situation and trend in the  crimes that are classified as serious. In comparison the 1992  this indicator dropped by 1.4 percent. This might appear to be a  very insignificant reduction, but if you consider that serious  crimes in the republic as a whole have shown a consistent  tendency to grow in recent years, the positive changes and the  effectiveness of the measures we are taking in this area must be  recognized.    The activism and labor productivity of our employees has  risen in an absolute majority of the city and rayon police  divisions.    The percentage of crimes solved is properly considered the  main criterion for evaluating the activity of internal affairs  organs. Last year this indicator (I will add, a very important  one) rose from 35.3 to 46.6 percent. But it still does not  satisfy us.    [Interviewer] And us, the inhabitants of Moldova, even less.  Numbers are well and good, but the social terror is more real  than statistics. It results above all from the sharp growth in  crime, especially among young people. Drug addiction,  prostitution. How are police organs fighting this social evil?    [Antoci] In 1993 our police recorded 1,972 crimes committed  by adolescents. Unfortunately, growth of crimes among young  people in recent years is raising its own "goals." It is  especially bad in this sense in Belts, Bender, and Ryshkan. And  in Ungen the increase was some 350 percent!?    Unfortunately, the number of serious crimes committed by  adolescents has also increased. There were 125 percent more  homicides, 40 percent more cases of serious bodily injury, and  19 percent more rapes.    The figures are very alarming. The socioeconomic condition  of  the republic, the sharp reduction in jobs, and the closing of  numerous educational institutions are significant factors in all  this.    As for drug addiction, the main efforts of the republic's  internal affairs organs have been directed to prevention and  quickly solving crimes committed by addicts. But meanwhile drug  addiction and illegal trade in psychotropic substances in the  republic are growing in scale. It is becoming a serious social  evil. In 1993 police organs recorded 265 crimes related to  illegal trade in narcotics (248 of them or 93.6 percent were  solved). But in 1992 there were just 120 such crimes. Such a  rate of growth puts you very much on guard. Ten of "our"  Moldovan citizens were arrested for trade in narcotics in  Romania, and two in Ukraine. On the other hand, we have plenty  of "visitors" from other regions. For example, in September of  last year our people arrested a certain P. Portnov from Samara,  a shipping agent of the Samaramebel Joint-Stock Society, in the  Oknitsa hotel, and found that he had 8 kilograms of poppy heads.  A more recent example occurred on 12 January when S. Grishin, a  Russian citizen, was arrested in Oknitsa in possession of 8.7  kilograms of this toxic substance.    Another problem is also alarming--the decline in morals,  especially among young people. This has led to the formation of  a specialized division, the morals police within the Ministry of  Internal Affairs system, by Decision of the Presidium of the  Parliament of the Republic of Moldova. The division engages in  preventing and stopping propaganda for pornography, sadism, and  the cult of violence and fights the spread of AIDS and venereal  diseases, prostitution, and other offenses against public  morality.    [Interviewer] A new generation has joined police organs  recently. Police work is complex. They deal with people.  Crudeness, lack of tact, and insensitivity are intolerable here.  Probably many moral qualities of the future guardians of order  and legality must be taken into account in recruiting them. In  general, how is personnel selection organized in your  organization, and how do you fight for the honor of the uniform?  This question also ties in with the fact that, alas, among the  police there have been extortionists, thieves, and many other  violators of the law. Our journalists sometimes write about them.    [Antoci] It should be clear to everyone that with the  transition to market relations, unrestrained inflation, and  unemployment, which have separated people into prosperous and  needy, police work has become much more complicated.    Based on this the 1 December 1992 Decree of the Government  of  the Republic of Moldova reorganized the structure of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs and police subdivisions  fundamentally. The number of municipal, criminal, economic, and  highway police and investigators was brought into line with  present-day requirements.    The Ministry of Internal Affairs is working seriously on  selection of new, qualified employees to fill vacant positions.  The moral and work characteristics of the candidates are  necessarily considered in selection. They undergo  psycho-physiological testing at the military medical commission.    In 1993 more than 2,500 people were admitted to the service.  Among them were 756 in leadership positions. Unfortunately, only  191 of the persons admitted into the service had specialized  legal education (at present the capacities of the specialized  educational institutions are very limited).    It should also be acknowledged here, unfortunately, that  accidental people, violators of discipline, and even people who  have taken up the path of crime do get into our ranks. In 1993  668 persons were discharged from internal affairs organs for  committing actions that discredited the title of police officer  and 95 were discharged for service unsuitability.    People also leave our ranks for other reasons. The level of  pay is inadequate, and domestic conditions are hard. It is a big  mistake to think that police have an easy life. We have many  purely domestic concerns.    [Interviewer] If it is not a secret, how many members are  there in the Moldovan police and what does the rank-and-rile  police employee earn? Ordinary people are jealous of them and  believe they get fantastic amounts. But in talking with police  employees you also hear complaints. Arbitrary leveling occurs,  they say. Detectives receive about the same as police employees  sitting in warm, comfortable offices. The one is constantly on  the brink of danger and may get a bullet or a--excuse the  term--"pen" [criminal slang for "knife"] in the stomach, while  the other takes no risks.    [Antoci] Overall the number of police employees relative to  the population of Moldova is no higher than in the republics of  the CIS or other countries and it has not changed in the last 3  years. Military servicemen of the carbine troops are also used  to patrol and guard certain sites to fight crime in many cities  and populated points.    As for pay, it depends of the employee's years of service in  the police and ranges from 40 to 150 lei. You must agree that  that is not so much. At some enterprises and companies, for  example, people receive much more just for services in guarding  a site. You should not forget about the extreme conditions in  which most of our police personnel work.    About "leveling." Indeed, the pay system that exists today  does not, unfortunately, permit a differentiated approach to  defining the labor of each individual employee. But the Ministry  of Internal Affairs is preparing appropriate proposals on this.  It is true that at present employees of the operational  services, investigation, and other subdivisions with especially  difficult working conditions receive pay supplements (from 15 to  50 percent of their salaries) depending on results achieved, and  preferences in acquiring the next rank have been established in  the operational services to retain our primary core group of  professionals.    [Interviewer] Is your system experiencing what is called the  "brain drain"? There was a time when outstanding specialists  were forced to look for work outside the republic or in  profit-making structures here.    [Antoci] I have already answered that question in part when  I  spoke of the very difficult period in which we are all living.  The sharp decline in the economy could not help but be reflected  in what you call the "brain drain." Unfortunately, outstanding  specialists, top-quality professionals, are abandoning our ranks  today too, even before reaching the desired pension age. But  only a few find work outside the republic. Most of them,  dissatisfied with the pay and working conditions, leave and find  work in profit-making structures within the republic. This  continues to be a sore spot for us.    [Interviewer] There is an economic police force. In addition  the Moldovan Ministry of Finance formed a financial guard. Isn't  there duplication of work here, unnecessary activity and waste  of money?    [Antoci] That is a timely question. In fact, in the initial  stage of transition of the economy to the free market with its  companies, concerns, commercial banks and so on, other control  organs were formed in the republic in addition to the economic  police, among them the financial guard. But experience confirmed  your fears and ours: duplication started and dispersion of  funds, and it became necessary to review the staff of the  control organs. Substantiated proposals on this matter have  already been submitted to the Government of the Republic of  Moldova. The essential point of them is that for purposes of  more effective crime fighting it would be advisable in this  sphere to form a single professional control organ on the basis  of the economic police and the financial guard.    [Interviewer] Our last question, with hopes for an  optimistic  answer. Will the mighty detachment of Moldovan police be able to  significantly reduce the level of crime in the coming year? Will  we be able, suppose, to go for peaceful family walks in the  evening in any remote part of the city, places where today--why  hide it--you will not find any police patrols?    [Antoci] I think that we have grounds for cautious optimism.  Let me repeat, cautious. The time of mindless "deadlines" for  eliminating crime and posing the challenge of "sharply reducing  it" has passed. Everything is much more complex than that.    The criminal world reacts quickly to the various changes in  society. It is extremely dangerous today. It is well organized,  corrupt, very well armed, and unrestrained in its choice of  means.    General success in the struggle to root out the criminal  world will come only with a general normalization of the moral  climate of society. But the police must oppose the criminal  world and they can do it.    Yes, it is the duty of the policy to guard order and the  lawful interests of our people, but the people themselves can  actively help the police.    [Interviewer] Thank you, mister minister, for your answers.

headline:    German Analysts Laud Steps Toward Market Economy 
text:  Language:   German   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Bettina Burger and Markus Lenzer: "Tallinn's   Reform Successes With Social Difficulties"]    [Text] Hamburg--The slump in the Estonian economy is likely  to come to an end by the turn of the year. As early as 1992 the  drop in the real GDP was 20 to 25 percent lower than originally  forecast.    If it should be confirmed that in the past year the GDP grew  from a nominal 13.5 billion Estonian kroons (8 Estonian kroons =  1 German mark) in 1992 to about 20 billion kroons, one would  even have to anticipate a slight amount of growth in real GDP  for 1993, with a moderate annual inflation of about 30 percent.    The driving force behind the economic development is to an  increasing extent private companies. These usually involve newly  founded firms and privatized state-owned enterprises.    The government has succeeded in rapidly promoting  privatization in some sectors. With the creation of a single  privatization agency in the summer of 1993, privatization  activities were also organizationally streamlined and the  potential overlapping of expertise avoided.  <H5>  Tourism and Marine Transportation With High Growth Rates </H5>   By the end of December 1993, 45 out of the total of 130  internationally competing major companies had been wholly or  partially privatized. In the framework of small-scale  privatization, over the first nine months of 1993 approximately  60 percent of the small industrial enterprises had been  transferred to private hands. In this area the pace of  privatization will slow down, however, since questions of the  legality of property created before the independence ("black  privatization") have not yet been solved.    In the trade and service sector, the transfer of property  should continue to take place quickly. About 80 percent of the  privatization had been completed by the fall of 1993.    While all of industry is recovering only slowly, the service  industries of tourism and marine transportation are recording  high growth rates. The income from these services at present  represents Estonia's most important source of foreign revenue.  The extensive influx of foreign currency simultaneously  reinforces confidence in the Estonian kroon.      One guarantee of the stability of the Estonian kroon is a  restrictive monetary and fiscal policy, which continues to be  consistently implemented by the central bank and the government.  For the current year an inflation rate of about 20 percent is  anticipated. This figure was also taken as the basis for the  1994 national budget passed in December 1993 with a total volume  of 5.7 billion kroons.    To make it possible to have the balanced budget mandated by  law, the spending margins for 1994 have been set just as narrow  as in the previous year's budget. However, these economy  measures represent a significant component of the stability  policy. But those portions of the population which are  particularly affected by the economic conversion process suffer  particularly from this, among them unemployed, retirees, and  families with many children.    The small amount of money for unemployment compensation is  offered through an employment fund, which is exclusively funded  by the national treasury. At 180 kroons the unemployment  compensation is clearly below the minimum subsistence level of  280 kroons. It is therefore so low that many unemployed do not  even turn to the labor office where they are officially  registered.    The official unemployment figures, which form the basis for  the state's spending, greatly improve on the actual employment  development. While the official unemployment rate on 1 September  1993 was 1.84 percent (16,151 unemployed), the actual rate of  unemployed is estimated to be three to four times higher. For  the end of 1994 an official unemployment figure of 40,000  persons is expected.    A faster drop in employment is anticipated above all in the  heavy industrial enterprises, since they are still at the  beginning of the restructuring. Many workers have already been  affected by a cutback in working hours and forced vacations.  Between January and July 1993 nearly 27,000 workers were thus  temporarily laid off.    The lack of financial means also prevents the necessary  expansion of the administrative organization. For this reason  people looking for work can only expect little support from the  labor offices in helping to find jobs. Training and continuing  education programs are still largely lacking.      Pensions and child subsidies are financed through the social  fund, the second leg of the social net. The social fund receives  most of its funding from employer contributions (social taxes).  Due to the poor payment ethics of business owners, about  one-third of the fund must be subsidized by the state. Here as  well the financial scope permits only minor support payments and  for those affected it means a daily struggle for survival. The  amount of the pension, which so far is still independent of  income, is usually the minimum subsistence level.    To guarantee at least a cost-of-living adjustment for all  subsidies, including unemployment money, employment and social  funds had to be financially replenished. The amendment to the  social law, which took effect at the beginning of the year, can  be regarded as a small step in this direction. It enables better  control and sanction mechanisms with which to reinforce the  payment ethics of the employers. The anticipated additional  income is intended to raise the level of support and make the  system of social security more efficient.    The government finds itself in a dilemma with which all  transformation nations in Eastern Europe are being confronted.  This refers to the target conflict between macroeconomic  stabilization on the one hand, and battling social hardships on  the other. Only in this way can broad acceptance of the  market-economic reforms be achieved. Estonia has shown that  despite the existing structural weaknesses, it has set out on a  promising path in the direction of market economy.

headline:    Police Official on Mafia Activities in Paldiski 
text:  Language:   Finnish   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Jorma Rotko: "In Paldiski, Estonia Everything Is   the Way It Was in the Soviet Period"]    [Text] The buildings are dilapidated, the signs on  storefronts are printed in Russian, and the selection of goods  is meager. The Soviet Union is dead, but its ghost still walks.  In the Paldiski base in Estonia it is still possible to become  acquainted with genuine Soviet goings-on, since neither  Gorbachev's perestroyka nor Yeltsin's edicts have penetrated  there.    The Estonians have attempted to push their own  administration  into the region, but the city continues to be ruled by a city  council of a kind that has ceased to exist in Russia. Passports  are issued and cars registered by a body called the Paldiski  Branch Office of the Leningrad Militia.  <H5>  Change in the Landscape </H5>   Estonia's economy has developed rapidly, and this is visible  in the exterior appearance of cities and villages. This makes  the change in landscape when one drives to Paldiski all the  greater.    Everything is the way it was in the Soviet period. The  buildings are gray and dilapidated. The signs on the store  fronts are written in Russian, and the selection of goods is  meager in contrast to the rest of Estonia, where one can obtain  everything now.    On the city's main street there is a pothole that could  swallow a car, and traffic is routed around it on the sidewalk.  Telephones operate sporadically or not at all.    There were local elections in Estonia last fall, but they  could not be held in Paldiski, because a list of eligible voters  was not prepared for the city. The Russian militia did not agree  to hand over a list of the city's residents, and now it has  become clear that they did not have a proper list.    Last week some kind of document on which was recorded the  number of persons moving to Paldiski and departing from there in  the course of the years was handed over to the Estonian police.  There is no information about the actual number of residents in  Paldiski.    The city council continues its existence as if nothing had  happened. It distributes apartments to those who need them and  issues administrative regulations without paying much attention  to Estonian opinions about what should be done in the city.  Recently the Estonian Government made Paldiski a city district  of the neighboring city Keila, so that Paldiski could have some  kind of Estonian administration. For the time being this has had  no effect at all on the course of life in the city.    In negotiations between the Estonians and Russians, the  register for Paldiski's motor vehicles was promised to the  Estonians, but the Russian militia has not handed it over but  rather has proposed that the register be made one issue in the  negotiations between Estonia and Russia.  <H5>  A Paradise for Car Thieves </H5>   It is an open secret in Estonia that many stolen cars are  taken to Paldiski. The Russian militia registers the cars in the  Russian car register, and the papers are in order.    Junior Inspector Agu Mitt of the Estonian police force, who  works in Paldiski, reports that previously cars were taken to  Russia on naval vessels.    "The stolen cars were hidden in the deserted missile bunkers  in Paldiski, for example. When a naval transport ship arrived in  the harbor, the cars were driven onto the ship in the dark of  the night. I myself traced a new Mercedes 600, but it managed to  drive onto a ship, and nothing could be done. The Estonian  police are still too weak to dare to raid a great power's naval  vessel."    Agu Mitt said that two kinds of cars are taken to Russia.  Either a Lada or a brand-new Western car is stolen. Old Western  cars are not suitable in Russia, because spare parts for them  cannot be obtained there.    Last year over 1,000 cars vanished without a trace in  Estonia, and the police are certain that they were exported to  Russia, often through Paldiski. Several insurance companies no  longer sell theft insurance for new Western cars.    Since the Paldiski administration is in a state of  confusion,  the city has become a favorite hiding place for the Russian  mafia. There is no address registration, so that professional  criminals fall into the clutches of the police only by chance.    Agu Mitt reported that one arrested criminal was taken by  force from the Estonian police station in Paldiski.    "During the night 20 armed Russians rushed in at a time when  there was only one man on duty. Of course he could have cut  loose with an automatic weapon, but this would have created  havoc, and the consequence would have been a political conflict.  Thus there was nothing to be done but let the man go."  <H5>  Population Does Not Decline </H5>   About 200 Estonians and about 7,000 Russians live in  Paldiski. Although the naval base has already been shut down  with the exception of the submarine training center, the city's  population has not declined. The thing is that the Russians have  not shipped the officers out of Paldiski but rather they have  remained there to live as "pensioners."    The temptation to participate in criminal operations is  great, since the pension paid by Russia is only 600 kroons (280  markka) per month.    With the exception of the nuclear reactor building and the  submarine training center, the military sites in Paldiski are in  rundown condition. All possible metal, including the metal roofs  of buildings, has been plundered to be sold.    The Russian demand that Estonia compensate Russia for the  money that Russia invested in the buildings in the past has  aroused irritation in Estonia. "When you go, take with you the  rubbish that is left."

headline:    Prime Minister Views State Budget, Political Situation 
text:  Language:   Latvian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview of Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs by Valdis   Bekeris: "`The Budget is the Nation's Policy in Figures...'"]    [Text]    [Bekeris] You agreed to this interview, Mr. Prime Minister,  a  few days after the Latvian government basketball team decisively  defeated a Lithuanian team of no lesser standing.    [Birkavs] Yes, this victory places upon us the  responsibility  of seriously preparing for the next meeting, for the Lithuanian  government anticipates holding this next sports meeting in  Kaunas, in the famous arena where the "Zalgiris" team normally  plays before five thousand spectators. In addition, the head of  the Lithuanian government said that they will now begin serious  training. If we are talking about the significance of the recent  game, then, it seems to me, it very much strengthened our  informal contacts with the Lithuanian government.    [Bekeris] How did you do personally in this game?    [Birkavs] I didn't even notice how quickly I received the  five personal fouls. But I had the honor of tossing in the  second and third baskets in the beginning. Then the [Economics  Minister Ojars] Kehris and [Internal Affairs Minister Girts]  Kristovskis offensive started.    [Bekeris] In your New Years speech, heard by all the people,  you picturesquely spoke of, cited, "the golden sands of the  economy, which will not pour into our own hands because they are  found in the bottom half of our hour glass. The structure of the  national economy must be turned to its proper position so that  the sands can pour into Latvia's granaries." The new year, as  they say, is moving along, but the old one leaves its own  legacy. What is that?    [Birkavs] Perhaps, examining it superficially, it appears  that nothing in particular is happening with the economy. But in  reality we already in the previous year have put in place and  also this year are putting into place, the foundation that will  will permit the economy to recover. Statistics indisputably show  that this process has begun. Of course, it has not been as rapid  as we would like, not as grand, and yet the volume of production  grows larger and the consumer price index confirms that this  recovery process also influences prices. In principle, the  process to a greater or lesser degree happens in accordance with  our projections. What sorts of tasks must the government  complete this year? We must reduce interest rates on loans,  although in regard to this a completely clear future is not  apparent. The privatization process must be sped up. I hope that  the package of bills will be adopted immediately. It will speed  up this process even more and provide the opportunity to  restructure production. That is why there is a basis for the  economic projection of five percent growth in total production.  That is a significant indicator, but it is "large" only because  we have "fallen greatly". This year Latvia will receive the most  investment in Eastern Europe: a total of $600 million. Other  investments will accompany this. The conditions which were  placed on all investments are skillful and economical  utilization of our local human resources and factories.  Therefore the determining factors for economic recovery are  investment, privatization, and a decline in borrower interest  rates. In the future they will be the steps that will turn the  structure of the economy in the right direction.    [Bekeris] The Saeima has passed on its first reading the  government's budget proposal. But if this proposal is thrown out  or derailed....    [Birkavs] Even the strongest structure can be derailed, but  this budget is still not the "strongest structure." It is only  balancing the fragile. In the course of discussions a whole  range of emphases appeared, quite essential supplements and also  new priorities, including defense policy, which require greater  financing than we had anticipated. Therefore everything depends  on how precisely we will be able to work these new demands into  the budget by the second reading. I do not think that it is  possible to improve the budget significantly. We have maximal%w  increased revenues, maximally sought to balance the budget's  social part with expenditures.... The vote on child subsidies  placed an immense supplemental load on the CM [Cabinet of  Ministers]. In fact it will not resolve the problems of the  "poorest," but more likely of the "most prosperous." Still, we  have found an option, putting forth an amendment to resolve this  problem. Indexing pensions also requires supplemental  expenditures. That is why we must carry out some very difficult  jobs by the second reading, and I hope that we will succeed in  establishing an economic structure which the Saeima will not be  able to destroy.    [Bekeris] Would the complete rejection of the budget  proposal  threaten the resignation of the government?    [Birkavs] I passed Mr. Kirsteins on my way back to my seat,  after I gave my "budget speech," which I closed by saying that  by not accepting it the Saeima invokes Article 7 of the Cabinet  of Ministers system: an expression of no confidence in the  government. Mr. Kirsteins said to me, "But that could not happen  on the first reading. We must wait for the second."    In essence we announced the budget policy with the first  reading. With the second reading of the budget, if it is amended  to the point that it no longer corresponds to government policy,  if it is "harmonized" so that it no longer corresponds to our  priorities, then I will simply resign. But it would be much  easier for me to resign, and I have emphasized it many times, if  our opposition had drafted an alternative budget. Then I would  have a clear conscience, for I would know who was coming after  me and with what sort of political outlook. Right now I will do  everything so that the budget is adopted and the government's  priorities are accepted, and therefore I will not resign. But,  if this budget is voted down, then, as I already said, Article 7  will go into effect and my "easy life" will begin.    [Bekeris] The previous government was not threatened with  this "easy life."    [Birkavs] No. In no way. We worked out that article  ourselves. The Cabinet of Ministers discussed this rule, for the  budget is the government's and the nation's policy in figures.    [Bekeris] What have been the consequences of the  "significant" new year's date, the events of 10 January? Did  Vidzeme borough council chairman Andrejs Rucs really cause a  crisis situation? And another related question about this  situation, which was predicted to have far-reaching  consequences: Why was Supreme Court chairman Gvido Zemribo the  first to react with his statement, rather than the government?    [Birkavs] I think the the government reaction was  sufficiently active, clear and unambiguous. I must say candidly  that the world has evaluated it positively. That is also  discernable from the side of Russia, for our bilateral  negotiations have not been interrupted. But still, we  encountered two impediments right after these events. That is  the Northwestern Army Group's declaration about shooting if  their installations are threatened, and Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev's declaration that the Baltic states belong within  "their" sphere of interest. Even if we ignore the later  retraction of this declaration, we must be extraordinarily  careful and capable in our actions. Our capacity for action  became clear even before Kozyrev's declaration: We announced  that national security is our priority number one. The actions  of Rucs were the catalyst and to a large extent laid bare the  situation. It threw us back considerably in our negotiations  with Russia, significantly limiting our ability to maneuver in  these negotiations. I must say that although Rucs demonstrated  completely apolitical action, it still expressed that popular  desire, to wit, that it is high time for the Russian army to  leave. There can be no more procrastinating, for the coatrack is  full and patience is almost at an end.    [Bekeris] The Vidzeme borough municipal deputies corps has  demanded that Rucs be allowed to return to his former position.    [Birkavs] I would not want to read tea leaves. Rubiks was  elected to the Saeima, Siegerist was elected. The viewpoint of  the public is a sacred thing. If there is no legal hurdle, of  course, Mr. Rucs will be able to return to his former post. But  I think that this event illuminates for us also the necessity  for regulating relations between municipalities and the  government more precisely, for until now the status of municipal  deputies has been higher than the status of Saeima deputies. If  a Saeima deputy has committed an offense, he can immediately be  detained, but municipal deputies may not be. I do not assume  that deputies are criminally inclined, but offenses as such  create an exclusive situation in which it is necessary to act.  This kind of situation must be precisely reflected in law.    [Bekeris] The Russian Foreign Minister's declaration has  been  heard throughout the world. After it was made the thoughts were  expressed that it was incorrectly understood and translated. Did  you perceive it in the same way?    [Birkavs] Nothing was misunderstood. That is Kozyrev's  style:  First to express himself very strongly, then to turn around  completely, see what the reaction will be, and after that to  say, 'I was not even thinking that.' Let's remember his  Stockholm speech. In essence it was a professional overture, how  far can Russia permit herself to go in her statements and  actions, especially after the meeting between Clinton and  Yeltsin. There were no misunderstandings or inadvertant word  games, but rather a deliberate action by Kozyrev to explain what  the reaction will be.    [Bekeris] What, in your opinion, is the status of the  Latvian  army? Can this force be viewed as a guarantor of national  security?    [Birkavs] The guarantor of Latvia's independence and  security  are the Latvian people themselves. The Army only carries out  certain functions in order to enforce this guarantee with  weapons in hand. Today (21 January) I had my regular meeting  with Defense Force leaders. We must seriously turn to defense  questions so that with minimal resources we can acquire a  maximally organized and battle ready defense system. People must  have faith in the army and must feel secure. I must admit that  until now we really have not addressed the army's problems--I  will not mince my words--we have neglected them. If security  becomes priority number one, then we must guarantee normal  supplies of weapons and ammunition for the army. But we cannot  become involved in some sort of arms race which would leave us  naked and impoverished. We must evaluate our options, but we  cannot pursue them at the cost of the educational, cultural or  social spheres.    [Bekeris] How has the situation with the intelligence  services developed? The veil of ignorance and secrecy  surrounding them gives rise to malicious rumors and gossip.    [Birkavs] The situation with the intelligence services is  unsatisfactory. I think that that will not continue for long.  The Cabinet of Ministers has prepared a restructuring program  for the intelligence services. The new order will bring all of  these systems into mutual harmony. Each worker will receive  precise, certain duties. Everything will be done so that the  country is better supplied with information, timely analysis and  everything else that is necessary for her security. The Cabinet  of Ministers adopted article 81 of the counter-intelligence  rules, which the Saeima did not accept. Therefore the government  will put forth an initiative asking that the Saeima accept them  on an urgent basis, for the rules heretofore do not satisfy me  personally.    [Bekeris] Will we soon be able to produce goods, both  manufactured and agricultural goods, marked "Made in Latvia" for  the world market and really ensure coverage of the lats? Right  now there is talk of a stable lats being an illusion,  emphasizing that the lats is competing with the dollar in an  uneven battle, unsuccessfully seeking to conquer stable foreign  currency.    [Birkavs] Latvian goods will never make it to the world  market if they are oriented only toward the Eastern market. On  the other hand, if these goods are oriented toward that sphere  which in which it is very difficult to compete right now, toward  the Western market, then they will always be able to compete in  Russia's market also. That is why, it seems to me, we must think  about what direction we want our economy moving in. We can go to  the Eastern market, renewing our old economic connections and  not especially renovating our technology. But let's take into  account that there is no foreign capital in Russia either, and  that that country too, with the free market regime Western goods  are flooding in. This market is large, and within it also there  stands a high capacity for competition. That is why it is better  to orient ourselves to the West, but always, knowing that we can  go to the East, it is not necessary to orient ourselves  completely to this market. As pertains to the illusory stability  of the lats.... Its actual stability will alway depend upon the  [central] bank's economic monetary policy connection with all  national economic policy. If monetary policy is just as isolated  from national economic policy as it has been until now, then the  stability of the lats may be threatened. But they may not  interfere in administrative undertakings; in this well  considered cooperation is essential.    [Bekeris] Did the rapid decline in production of  manufactured  goods and the accompanying unemployment, cause you to worry?    [Birkavs] Obviously the chief problem this year will be the  increase in unemployment and the accompanying expenditures for  retraining the unemployed. But it is better to invest money in  unemployment benefits and training than to maintain enterprises  which produce goods for warehouses and produce them for a higher  price than anywhere else in the world. As enterprises go  bankrupt and close the next action must immediately follow: New  jobs must be created. Toward this end either private companies  must take over the factories, or foreign investment must flood  in, or the appropriate state policy must be implemented with  investment. That is one of the heaviest issues which, I think,  we will be able to resolve positively this year; utilizing  domestic accumulation for investment. Currently we are chiefly  financing future technological projects on the basis of foreign  credits. Domestic investment reserves are small.    [Bekeris] The rate of inflation keeps going up. How long  will  that continue?    [Birkavs] Inflation has its own laws. After the introduction  of the turnover tax the anticipated increase in the rate of  inflation reached its maximum in December and November of last  year. Now the prognosis is stronger: the rate has a tendency to  slide downward. In relation to the increase in the turnover tax,  I made this prognosis precisely at that time; the talk was of  three or four months in which an increase in inflation was  inescapable, which would worsen the economic situation. Just as  inescapable is a further decrease in inflation and the  stabilization of the situation. The appropriate economic policy  is being maintained, as confirmed by international experience.    [Bekeris] The current bureaucracy is being critized. Under  the influence of the law on civil service a new, and, we must  hope, progressive and intelligent "bureaucratic apparatus" will  be established. What are your thoughts about that?    [Birkavs] An interesting phenomenon can be observed: They  strongly criticize the bureaucracy, but do not want to establish  a new bureaucracy. I undoubtedly evaluate positively the new  reform of the bureaucracy. That is one of our programmatic  assignements: to bring order to the bureaucracy and train them.  The new bureaucracy reform is receiving no small amount of  criticism, but I am satisfied to a certain extent because  currently the existing bureaucrats very fearful of these  changes. I think that no honorable or forward-looking bureaucrat  is afraid of the reform. I could argue over whether this  bureaucratuc reform must occur at such a fast tempo. But  bureaucracy is a basic element of every country's mechanism. It  is important that bureaucrats serve the public. Right now we are  all dissatisfied with the bureaucracy. That is why we should not  be stingy with work and resources in this area. I do not see a  different road. Right now many of the more capable and smarter  people are leaving the bureaucracy, going to work for private  companies. We cannot pay bureaucrats high salaries, but we can  compensate for this work with the greatest demands of the  bureaucracy, which are related to sufficient social guarantees.  Thousands of people want to work securely, not to feel  threatened, to serve the country, to serve the people. The law  on the bureaucracy is vitally essential.    [Bekeris] The current bureaucracy is connected with bribe  taking and bribe giving. I would like to mention another one of  your public pronouncements, when your were speaking of a  specific example of bribe giving. The state reform minister  Maris Gailis became a sacrifice to that. But by starting with  holding the bribe givers responsible, is not the corruption  problem being resolved from the wrong end? They say that if  there were no bribe takers, then bribe givers would not arise.  Of course the reaction of Maris Gailis was sharp and dignified,  as becomes a high-ranking official.    [Birkavs] Information about a person who takes bribes is  broadcast rather quickly. They give to those who take, but they  do not even make offers to those who do not take and they try to  find alternative ways around them. The needed information about  those "takers" disappear into the sand, for there is no one who  will point a finger, 'See, this official takes bribes.' And only  recently special operations have been carried out on the  borders, where customs agents were arrested for taking a $2,500  bribe, a concrete fact was demonstrated. Or in the Riga Central  Market, when several security police workers were arrested for  demanding bribes from illegal liquor sellers. Only when special  operations are conducted or preparing a special professional  provokation to catch a guilty one, then bribe givers or bribe  takers can possibly be caught. In corruption both parties, the  taker and the giver, are interested in hiding the crime. In  these crimes the so-called likelihood is the highest. There are  crimes in which both parties are interested in finding the  criminals, let's say murder. Representatives of state justice  protection services and the victim's loved ones are direclty  interested in rapid, operational investigation of the crime. You  will be more interested in the apprehension of a pickpocket if  you are one of the victims, for the state's interest in these  crimes is determined, if only because the police cannot cope  with all the pickpockets. But crimes in which both parties are  interested in hiding the transgression, such as bribe taking and  taking, are the most difficult to investigate. The battle  against corruption must be waged with special actions; those who  carry it out must be given special rights and assignments.    [Bekeris] Are you still leading the Jurists Association of  Latvia?    [Birkavs] Still. Although I have passed down my authority  and  given it over to the association's four vice presidents. But I  have remained in this post formally and just recently I attended  the association's five year anniversary party. I also  participate in the association's council meetings. The  Association of Lawyers is helping me greatly in terms of  implementing the judicial reform by providing me with specific  proposals.    [Bekeris] Doesn't the decreased financing of the justice  system threaten their independence, and perhaps for that very  reason it is difficult for it to lose its political coloring, to  better carry out juridical, that is law enforcement duties?    [Birkavs] I do not want to agree that the justice system is  melting away on account of financing. This year to this end we  developed a financial foundation. Last year I personally  obtained a salary increase for judges, which, because of  inflation, unfortunately, was ineffective. Salaries in the  procuracy were also increased, but we must acknowledge that it  has all been insufficient. Now we are ensuring a judicial reform  with a financial basis. Have the courts been politicized? In my  opinion, this time has already receded into the past. Judges  and, I hope, also all the other justice system institutions are  depoliticized in point of fact.    [Bekeris] What sort of evaluation could you make as a lawyer  of the actions of Justice Minister [Egils] Levits, when in his  institution, in reducing its status, he nevertheless was forced,  by a legal order, to rehire the laid-off workers into their  previous posts?    [Birkavs] The answer to your previous question is hiding  here. Notwithstanding that this was the Justice Minister, the  court rehired the laid-off workers. This affair could also have  been "approached politically." The court fulfilled its duty to  the blind goddess of justice.    [Bekeris] How do you assess the activities of emigre  Latvians  who have returned to their homeland to work in responsible posts  in the Latvian state?    [Birkavs] There can be no general analysis. All of the  emigre  Latvians cannot be measured on one criterion. Mr. Siegerist is  also Latvian by ancestory. Everbody is different, more or less  professional in their actions, every one of them has made their  own path in life. And I think that they enrich our lives to a  large extent with their worldly experience. I would not want to  say that they are not needed here. These are people who are  developing into a part of our people, who are Latvians just like  us, only with a different education and life's experience. I  would not permit myself to judge any of them as higher or lower.  Under no circumstances would I distinguish the emigres over our  own folks, who lived for so long "in the Soviet regime," or vice  versa: distinguishing "our own" above "them." Everyone has their  own individual shortcomings, pluses and minuses. In my opinion  if someone is irresponsible in his position, then he must be  relieved. A local can be just as irresponsible in his assigned  post as can be an emigre Latvian.    [Bekeris] Still, the emigres do not have our real life  insights.    [Birkavs] Of course. But now that they have arrived in the  homeland they are beginning to have better insights, they are  running into the same negations with which we "locals" grapple.  But the fact that they perceive it differently enriches our  mutual insights.    [Bekeris] What is your view of adoption of the citizenship  law? Isn't it a sort of a frontier barrier, a trench which we  move away and move away, fearing to take the fateful leap, for  we might blunder, break a leg or, in the worst case, even the  backbone?    [Birkavs] Your comparison is truly unique and graphic. Also  not without basis. This jump could have been made long ago,  without fear of anything. I had hoped that this law would be  adopted last year. I still think that worries and the many  arguments have a strong basis, for the talk is not merely of  citizenship, but also about the fate of the nation. Two  classical approaches are evident. The radical position, which is  dominated by the survival and protection of the nation, and the  second position, which is dominated by the development of the  nation. This approach can be characterized by the prohibition,  that nothing should be adopted. Or also that this law should be  maximally narrowed. Truth is to be foundin the unification of  the principles of national survival and national development.  Now the first step has already been taken, to be followed by the  second, third and fourth. Obviously there will be a referendum.    [Bekeris] Do contacts between the Prime Minister and the  President continue to be good? Mr. Ulmanis emphasized the  significance of understanding in his New Year's interview with  RIGAS BALSS.    [Birkavs] I think that we have an understanding. In my view  the chief assignment from my side is to ensure stability.  Understanding from one side, stability from the other; that  would the most important thing.    [Bekeris] Does your mutual relationship also include  arguments?    [Birkavs] I haven't noticed any real arguments. But, taking  into account that the institution of the Presidency is renewed  and new, on many ocassions there arises the necessity to meet,  not to resolve misunderstandings, but to make more precise our  actions in conformance with the Constitution. We each see common  goals from our own positions. Here arises that prerogative, if  the President emphasizes a question of understanding, then I, as  the Prime Minister, with the executive agencies must ensure this  understanding.    [Bekeris] How do you evaluate the press? What is your  attitude toward "angry" journalists, who often are accused also  of destructive activities?    [Birkavs] I think that words must be free, but words may not  destroy the state. And, if this boundary is transgressed, then I  would like to work very actively.    [Bekeris] And again, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to  hold  you to your words, which you have spoken publicly. Specifically,  that journalist who is able to offend you in the press will be  granted an award from your personal salary. Does this promise  provide proof of the distinguished self-critical abilities, or  also do you as a person feel that your unconqerable sense of  humor is being trampled down?    [Birkavs] My colleagues warned me that journalists may now  begin a contest to make me look as black as they can. But I bear  no ill will either toward people or journalists. I assess people  according to their material qualities and according to what  orients them. If people are oriented toward evil, then action  must be taken. If people are writing malicious things because of  lack of understanding, then we must talk to them and explain  things. If they are mistaken, then they must be forgiven. But,  if they, in doing their jobs, strive and make my nose appear  bigger than it is, then that is really nothing, so why should I  be angry with it?    [Bekeris] How do you evaluate the judicial process, where we  have cases of insulting honor and reputation, and the  publication is the defendant?    [Birkavs] The most recent information I have received is  that  the journalist Gailums was fined 1,000 lats. I thought to  myself, first of all, where will Gailums get that kind of money?  And the second thing that came to mind, doesn't this judgment  muzzle journalists? And such a situation could be much more  significant than the material difficulties that have been  applied to Gailums. We must establish normal relations between  the press and the courts. That is a fine matter. The freedom of  the press is absolutely necessary in a normal country. There are  a few signals that bother me a bit. What is the journalists own  responsibilities regarding the information he disseminates? For  what and where should be held responsible? Those are the nuances  which in conditions of a lasting free press are polished  filigree, but we have not done that.    As we end our discussion, I will use the opportunity in this  first month of the new year to wish the readers of RIGAS BALSS  that they not lose their optimism, for optimism is the  foundation.    [Bekeris] Thank you.

headline:    State Border Regulations Issued 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     ["Regulations" under the rubric "In the Cabinet of Ministers   of the Latvian Republic," "No. 29 (Protocol No. 4, #22), Riga,  dated 11 January 1994: 'On the State Border of the Latvian  Republic', Issued in Accordance with Procedure Prescribed by  Article 81 of the Satversme"]    [Text]  <H5>  Section 1. General Provisions </H5>   Article 1. State Border of the Latvian Republic    The state border of the Latvian Republic (henceforth in this  text--"State Border") is the line and vertical plane coinciding  with this line which separates the land and water territory of  the Latvian Republic, its subsurface depths, and its airspace,  from neighboring states and the neutral waters of the Baltic Sea.    Article 2. Determination of the State Border and  Provision for Its Defense    The State Border is defined by bilateral agreements and  ratified interstate treaties concluded by the Latvian Republic  prior to 16 June 1940, and also by bilateral agreements  concluded later with neighboring states on the restoration or  designation of borders.    In places where the State Border does not conform to  interstate treaties concluded prior to 16 June 1940, it is  considered a temporary line of demarcation until conclusion of a  new interstate treaty. All norms included in this regulation  which have entered into force with respect to the State Border  are applicable to such a line of demarcation.    The Cabinet of Ministers undertakes measures within the  framework of its authority to defend the State Border and the  territory of the country.    Article 3. Designation of the State Border    Unless otherwise prescribed by an interstate treaty  concluded  by the Latvian Republic, the State Border is designated as  follows:    1) on land--by characteristic terrain features and clearly  discernible reference points;    2) in the Baltic Sea--by the outer limit of Latvian Republic  territorial waters;    3) in the Irves Strait and Gulf of Riga--in accordance with  bilateral agreements with the Estonian Republic;    4) on navigable rivers--along the river's main channel; on  nonnavigable rivers (streams)--along their centerline or center  of the main fluvial branch; on lakes and other bodies of  water--along a straight line connecting two points at which the  State Border emerges on the shore of the given lake or other  body of water.    When passing along a river, stream, lake, or other body of  water, the State Border does not change when the configuration  of the shores of the body of water changes, or when a river  (stream) changes its course;    5) on bridges and other structures that intersect border  sections designated over water--along the centerline of these  bridges and structures, or along their technological axis.    The State Border is designated on terrain by clearly  distinguishable border markers, whose form, size, and  installation procedure are determined by the Cabinet of  Ministers based on interstate treaties.    Article 4. Territorial Waters of the Latvian  Republic    Territorial waters of the Latvian Republic are the waters of  the Baltic Sea extending a distance of 12 nautical miles from  the line of maximum ebb tide along the Latvian shore (with the  exception of the Irves Strait and Gulf of Riga).    Article 5. Internal Waters of the Latvian Republic    The following constitute the internal waters of the Latvian  Republic:    1) the waters of ports of the Latvian Republic, bounded by a  straight line connecting those point locations of hydrotechnical  or other structures situated on opposite sides of a particular  port, which project the farthest towards the sea;    2) in the Irves Strait and Gulf of Riga--the waters bounded  by a line which connects the base line passing through the  southern part of the Cape Lode cliff and the center of Cape  Ovishrags. The Irves Strait and Gulf of Riga are the common  internal waters of the Latvian Republic and Estonian Republic.  The configuration of the State Border in the waters of the Gulf  of Riga is determined by interstate treaty between the Latvian  Republic and the Estonian Republic;    3) the waters of those rivers, lakes, and other bodies of  water whose shores belong entirely to the Latvian Republic.  <H3>  Section 2. Operating Regime of the State Border and Border  Zone </H3>   Article 6. Operating Regime of the State Border    The Operating Regime of the State Border:    1) determines the procedure for maintenance, security, and  crossing of the border, determines procedure for entry,  presence, and performance of work in the border strip, and in  border rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water of the Latvian  Republic, and determines the control procedures for compliance  with such;    2) determines the procedure according to which aircraft and  other flying objects cross the airspace of the State Border;    3) at the maritime border, determines the procedure  according  to which surface platforms may enter or be present in the  territorial and internal waters and ports of the Latvian  Republic.    The Operating Regime of the State Border is regulated by  these regulations, legislative acts of the Latvian Republic, and  interstate treaties concluded by the Latvian Republic.    Article 7. The State Border Strip    With the aim of ensuring proper order on the State Border,  the State Border Strip is established along the State Border.  The State Border Strip is a strip of land of predetermined width  adjoining the State Border, in which the Operating Regime of the  State Border is exercised. The State Border Strip is determined  by the Cabinet of Ministers in accordance with interstate  treaties that have been concluded.    Article 8. Crossing the State Border    All types of communications and dislocation across the State  Border are effected at border crossing locations determined by  the Cabinet of Ministers in accordance with the laws of the  Latvian Republic and interstate treaties concluded by the  Latvian Republic.    Seagoing and river vessels, naval warships, and other  surface  platforms cross the State Border in accordance with legislative  acts and regulations of the Latvian Republic which have been  published according to established procedure.    Aircraft and other flying objects cross the State Border  through specially determined air corridors in accordance with  legislative acts and regulations of the Latvian Republic which  have been published according to established procedure.    Crossings are permitted outside the boundaries of these air  corridors only upon authorization of the Cabinet of Ministers.    Article 9. Take-Off and Landing of Aircraft and Other  Flying Objects    Aircraft and other flying objects take off from the Latvian  Republic and land upon arrival in the Latvian Republic only at  airports and airfields prescribed for international flights,  which incorporate border control stations.    Procedure for take-off and landing is determined, and  changes  made thereto, by the Cabinet of Ministers and its subordinate  structures.    If a forced landing is necessitated, aircraft and other  flying objects may effect emergency landing at other airports  and airfields that do not have border control stations.    Article 10. Procedure for Visits of Foreign Vessels and  Other Surface Platforms in the Territorial and Internal Waters  of the Latvian Republic and Port Calls at Latvian Ports, and  Procedure for Their Departure    Any foreign ship has the right to enter the territorial  waters of the Latvian Republic for the purpose of crossing  without entering internal waters, of entering internal waters or  ports, and of heading out to the open sea, observing the  principle of nonstop peaceful passage.    Foreign naval warships may enter the territorial waters of  the Latvian Republic in accordance with procedure determined by  the Cabinet of Ministers. Foreign submarines may be located in  the territorial waters of the Latvian Republic only in the  surface mode and flying the flag that indicates their state.    Visits by foreign ships and other surface platforms and  their  presence in the territorial waters, roadsteads, and ports of the  Latvian Republic are effected in accordance with procedure as  determined by resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers and  international treaties.    Article 11. Control of Crossings of the State  Border    Persons, all varieties of means of transportation, cargo,  and  other property crossing the State Border are subject to border  crossing control in accordance with these regulations,  legislative acts of the Latvian Republic, and international  treaties concluded by the Latvian Republic.    Control of State Border crossings is exercised at border  control stations and border crossing points established by the  Cabinet of Ministers and state treaties.    Border control at border control stations is carried out by  border guards and customs agents. Medical quarantine,  veterinary, plant quarantine, and other control is also effected  at border control stations if necessary, as well as control of  the removal of cultural treasures.    Border control at border crossing points is carried out by  border guards only. Persons and means of transportation have the  right to cross the State Border at these points in accordance  with procedure determined by the Cabinet of Ministers and  interstate treaties.    Article 12. Passage of Persons, Means of  Transportation, Freight, and Other Property Across the State  Border    Persons, means of transportation, freight, and other  property  are granted passage across the State Border by Border Security  Forces when properly drawn up documents are presented affording  the right to cross the State Border.    Article 13. Operating Regime of Border Control  Stations    In order to establish and maintain necessary conditions for  the activity of border control stations related to the passage  of persons, means of transportation, freight, and other property  across the State Border, an operating regime is instituted at  these border control stations regulating the procedure by which  persons and means of transportation are held and transferred and  other activity is carried out related to the passage of persons,  means of transportation, freight, and other property across the  State Border.    The operating regime of border control stations is  established by the Cabinet of Ministers.    Border Security Forces at border control stations determine  the premises and territory in which border control is effected.  To prevent access by unauthorized persons to border control  areas and means of transportation crossing the State Border,  Border Security Forces may stipulate additional regulations with  respect to the operating regime of these premises and  territories.    The operating regime of the border control station extends  to  the entire territory of the regime of the transportation  establishment (airport, seaport, railroad passenger terminal,  seaport terminal, etc.).    Ensuring compliance with the operating regime of the border  control station is the mission of the Border Security Forces  jointly with the administrations of international seaports,  airports, and railroad stations, and with cooperation from the  police and Home Guard. Decisions of the Border Security Forces  are determinate in this cooperative effort.    Article 14. Economic Activity at the State Border    Any economic activity at the State Border is carried out in  accordance with decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers and  interstate treaties.    Article 15. Temporary Closing of the State Border    If the danger exists that infectious disease might be spread  in the territory of the Latvian Republic or that of a  neighboring state, Border Security Forces may, by decree of the  Cabinet of Ministers, temporarily restrict or terminate  communications across the State Border in areas exposed to the  danger, or establish quarantines for people, livestock, freight,  seeds, seed stock, seedlings, and other livestock and plant  products.    Article 16. Violators of the State Border    The following are violators of the State Border:    1) persons who cross or attempt to cross the State Border  outside border control stations and border crossing points;    2) persons who fail to observe the procedure established at  border control stations and border crossing points of the  Latvian Republic;    3) ships and other surface platforms that enter the  territorial or internal waters of the Latvian Republic or border  rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water of the Latvian Republic,  in violation of procedure for crossing the State Border;    4) aircraft and other flying objects that cross the State  Border without appropriate authorization or otherwise violate  the regulations for crossing the State Border.    Crossing the State Border is not recognized as unlawful if  the crossing takes place by mistake or under pressure (in the  event of an accident, natural calamity, or breakdown), if the  crew (passengers) of a vessel, aircraft, or other means of  transport are threatened by danger, or if such crossing is  necessary to convey rescued persons or render urgent medical aid.    Article 17. Authorized Representatives of the Latvian  Republic Border    In order to resolve issues related to maintaining the Regime  of the State Border and to manage border incidents, the Cabinet  of Ministers appoints authorized representatives of the Latvian  Republic border from among the officer corps of the Border  Security Forces for specific sectors of the State Border.    Authorized representatives of the Latvian Republic border  observe the laws and other normative acts of the Latvian  Republic and the provisions of international treaties in the  performance of their duties.    Issues not regulated by authorized representatives of the  Latvian Republic border are resolved through diplomatic channels.    Article 18. The Border Zone and Border Strip    In the security interests of the Latvian Republic, the  Cabinet of Ministers may establish a border zone along the land  portion of the State Border at least 15 kilometers wide, and a  border strip--an integral part of the border zone--not more than  two kilometers wide.    Article 19. Regime of the Border Zone and the Airspace  Above It. Regime of the Border Strip    Depending on political, economic, and ecological  circumstances, on the crime situation, population density, and  other factors, the Cabinet of Ministers may establish in the  border zone and airspace above it an appropriate regime of the  border zone and airspace above it.    In the security interests of the Latvian Republic, the  Cabinet of Ministers may stipulate additional regulations with  respect to the regime of the border strip.    In the border zone, all types of measures carried out in  cooperation with structural elements of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs and Home Guard are conducted upon coordination with the  Border Security Forces.    The leadership of the appropriate border battalion must be  informed of any movement or activity of armed formations of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, Customs Service, or Home Guard in  the border strip.    In the execution of their official duties, Border Security  Forces in the border strip, in the territory of border control  stations, and at border crossing points are not subordinate to  the police, customs authorities, Home Guard, or security  services of airports and seaports.    Article 20. Responsibility for Violations of  Legislative Acts on the State Border    Persons violating or attempting to violate the State Border  or regime of the border, border strip, or border control  stations, and persons rendering assistance to border violators  bear liability in accordance with legislative acts of the  Latvian Republic.  <H3>  Section 3. Authority of Institutions of State Government and  Other Organizations in the Sphere of State Border Security </H3>   Article 21. Authority of Institutions of State  Government of the Latvian Republic    (1) The Cabinet of Ministers provides funding for the  acquisition of arms and material resources necessary for border  security and for establishment of the infrastructure.    (2) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs:    1) carries out interstate negotiations, based on a decree of  the Saeima [parliament] or Cabinet of Ministers, on the  determination and ratification of the State Border, and on  establishment of the Regime of the State Border;    2) draws up for Latvian Republic citizens, foreign citizens,  and stateless persons, within the framework of its jurisdiction,  documents attesting to right of entry into the Latvian Republic  or right of exit out of it;    3) decides matters relating to introduction of the Regime of  the State Border and resolves border incidents not managed by  authorized representatives of the Latvian Republic border.    (3) The Ministry of Defense:    1) bears responsibility for security of the State Border on  land, in the air, and at sea;    2) resolves, within the framework of its jurisdiction,  incidents related to violation of the Regime of the State Border;    3) plans matters related to armament, weapons, means of  communications, means of transportation, material-technical  support, construction of facilities, and establishment of  infrastructure necessary to the Border Security Forces;    4) ensures that the missions of the Border Security Forces  are executed.    (4) Defense Forces Headquarters, jointly with the Home Guard  Headquarters, and with the participation of appropriate services  of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and  Ministry of Communications, develops and coordinates a draft  plan for security of the State Border.    (5) The Ministry of Internal Affairs provides information  and  support to Border Security Forces in the conduct of border  security measures, in efforts to combat illegal activity in the  border zone, in the search for violators of the State Border,  and in the discovery and verification of circumstances  concerning violations and perpetrators.    (6) State institutions of the Latvian Republic that exercise  customs, medical quarantine, veterinary, and plant quarantine  control, control over conveyance of cultural treasures, and  other types of control:    1) organize and carry out measures with the aim of  protecting  the economic interests of the state and providing ecological,  sanitary, and other protection, in accordance with legislative  acts;    2) within the framework of their jurisdiction, publish  normative acts mandatory in their application to all juridical  and physical persons in the territory of the Latvian Republic;    3) effect cooperation with the Border Security Forces and  provide them support.    Article 22. Participation of the Home Guard in the  Security of the State Border    Procedure with respect to involvement of the Home Guard in  the security of the State Border is determined by the Cabinet of  Ministers. Participation of the Home Guard in the accomplishment  of tasks of border security and cooperation with the Border  Security Forces is coordinated on the state and regional level.    The Home Guard Headquarters participates in development of  the plan for security of the State Border.  <H5>  Section 4. Security of the State Border </H5>   Article 23. Role of the System of Security of the State  Border in the Defense of the State    The system of security of the State Border must guarantee  the  inviolability of the State Border on land, at sea, and in the  air.    In peacetime, the land portion of the State Border is  protected by the Border Security Forces, the sea portion--by the  Navy, and the airspace portion--by the Air Force.    Article 24. Legal Basis of Activity of the Border  Security Forces    The following comprise the legal basis of activity of the  Border Security Forces, Navy, and Air Force (henceforth in these  regulations--"the Border Security Forces") with respect to  security of the State Border: the Satversme, the Law "On Defense  of the State," the Law "On the Defense Forces," these  regulations, and other laws and normative acts of the Latvian  Republic.    Article 25.

Article 26.

Article 27. Rights of the Navy in Security of the State  Border    Prior to entry into force of the Law "On the Navy," the  rights and duties of the Navy in the security of the State  Border are established by the Cabinet of Ministers.    Article 28. The Air Force has the right:    1) to exercise control of the airspace, and engage other  state institutions in clarification of the situation and  identification of aircraft in the airspace of the state;    2) in instances where danger of illegal crossing of the  State  Border arises, to prohibit or restrict aircraft flights in  certain regions of the state's airspace;    3) to demand that crews of aircraft illegally crossing the  State Border land their aircraft in the territory of the Latvian  Republic to explain the circumstances and reasons behind the  illegal crossing of the State Border.    Article 29. Use of Physical Force, Dogs, and Special  Means for Security of the State Border    The Border Security Forces have the right, in the execution  of their official duties, to use physical force, special means  (handcuffs, billy clubs, electric shock devices, tear gas,  chemical paralysis-inducing substances, means of halting  transportation, etc.), and dogs, with the aim of:    1) repulsing an attack upon border guards or other persons  executing their duties on the State Border;    2) detaining violators of the law who maliciously refuse to  subordinate themselves to border security personnel or who put  up resistance;    3) repulsing attacks against buildings, individual premises,  and means of transportation under the guard of border security  personnel, and liberating these facilities in the event they  become occupied by armed individuals.    Prior to the use of physical force or special means, a  person  (persons) must be warned of the intent to use such, except in  instances where delay in the use of physical force or special  means would cause a direct threat to the health or lives of  border security personnel or could entail other grave  consequences, or if such warning is impossible in the particular  situation.    The type of special means used is determined by the nature  of  the physical violation and the particular individual features of  the violator. When special means are used, it is necessary to  limit the damage caused by these means to the maximum extent  possible, and to ensure that medical assistance is rendered to  victims when necessary.    If as a result of the use of physical force or special  means,  an individual sustains injury or dies, the border guard involved  is obliged to so inform his immediate superior at once. The  latter then conveys this information to the procurator of the  district in question.    It is prohibited to use fighting (combat) techniques,  handcuffs, billy clubs, electric shock devices, tear gas,  chemical paralysis-inducing substances, or dogs against women,  persons with evident injuries or disabilities, or minors, except  in instances where their actions threaten the health of other  persons and where they put up physical resistance.    Procedure for the storage, carrying, and use of special  means  is prescribed by directive of the Ministry of Defense.    Article 30. Use of Firearms in Security of the State  Border    Shoot to kill is acknowledged as the technique of  application  of firearms in security of the State Border.    Military servicemen of the Border Security Forces have the  right to retain and carry a service firearm on a permanent  basis. Procedure for retaining and carrying firearms at their  disposal is determined by directive of the Ministry of Defense.    A military serviceman of the Border Security Forces is  authorized to use his firearm with the aim of:    1) repulsing armed attack against the territory of the  Latvian Republic or terminating the armed resistance of  attackers;    2) arresting a violator of the State Border in the absence  of  other ability to detain him;    3) repulsing attack and terminating resistance, including on  the part of unarmed individuals, if a real danger threatens the  lives of border security personnel or other persons and it is  impossible to avert this danger by other means, and also with  the aim of preventing attempts to forcefully gain possession of  his firearm;    4) detaining a means of transportation by inflicting damage  against it, if the driver is creating a real threat to the lives  and health of the border guard or other persons by virtue of his  actions and is not responding to the demands of the serviceman  to stop the means of transportation, and if there is no other  way of detaining it.    A military serviceman of the Border Security Forces has the  right to use his firearm to signal distress or to summon  assistance.    The use of firearms is prohibited:    1) against women, persons with evident injuries or  disabilities, and minors, except in instances where their  actions threaten the lives of other persons, when they are  putting up armed resistance, and when they are carrying out an  armed attack;    2) in instances where other persons may be injured as a  result of their use.      Article 31. The Border Guard    The border guard is an armed military serviceman of the  Latvian Republic who has been called to perform state service,  has taken the oath as a military serviceman of the Latvian  Republic, has passed a course of special border security  training, occupies a certain position in the Border Security  Forces, and has a military rank.    Article 32. Recruitment in the Border Security  Forces    Recruitment for the Border Security Forces is effected from  among citizens of the Latvian Republic in accordance with the  Law "On Defense of the State."    A border guard must have mastery of the state language and  be  able to communicate with the populace in the language of primary  use in the region of assignment.    Article 33. Responsibility of the Border Guard    A border guard bears responsibility for unlawful actions in  accordance with procedure prescribed by the laws of the Latvian  Republic. If a border guard has not observed the legal rights of  other persons and has caused them material damage, the Border  Security Forces are obliged to take measures to restore these  rights and compensate for the damage.    Article 34. Legal Protection and Guarantees of Border  Guard Activity    In carrying out his official duties, a border guard is a  representative of the state power of the Latvian Republic.    A border guard falls under the protection of the state. His  honor and dignity are protected by law.    In the border zone at border control stations and border  crossing points, all physical persons are obliged to fulfill the  demands and directives issued by a border guard in the  performance of his official duties.    A border guard is not responsible for physical or property  damage caused a violator of the law who shows insubordination or  puts up resistance at the time of arrest, if in fulfilling his  official duties the border guard has committed no violation of  his entrusted authority.    Injury inflicted to the health of a border guard or his  close  relatives and damage caused to his property in connection with  the performance of his duties is subject to compensation from  state budget funds in the full amount.  <H3>  Section 6. Financial and Material Support for the Border  Security Forces </H3>   Article 35.

headline:    Charges of LDDP Domination of Radio, TV Rebuffed 
text:  Language:   Lithuanian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Lidija Sabajevaite: "Who Usurped Radio and   Television?"]    [Text] No matter the occasion--whether it's from the Seimas  rostrum, or in the press, or at get-togethers--those on the  right are complaining that they do not have an opportunity to  express their opinion on the radio or television.  Simultaneously, the LDDP is accused of having usurped the  aforementioned means of information and of implementing a Soviet  era policy, when there was one set of speakers and one truth.    So that we might better comprehend those on the right, let's  return to the recent past. From the very moment that the  independence of our state was restored, they had unlimited  opportunities for presenting information. The right of all  representatives of the national government to have precedence in  using Lithuanian Radio and Television on issues pertaining to  their duties was fixed in article 6 of the Charter for  Lithuanian Radio and Television. This is why we watched  "Atgimimo banga" ["Wave of Rebirth"] each week, which was  gradually converted into a platform for government  representatives from the right side of the political spectrum;  on many an evening we listened to the speeches of always the  same politicians. Television acquired its "talking heads"  appellation.    Representatives on the left side of the political spectrum,  who made up an insignificant minority in the Supreme Council,  were unable to make use of the Article 6 right. They were  chastised as "enemies" by the "patriots", so it was not  permissible for the people to remember that they existed.  Besides that, all the air time was divided up among "one's own".    After the relationship of political forces in the government  changed in the wake of the Seimas elections, the Radio and  Television Board proposed relinquishing Article 6. Since this  elicited tempestuous dissatisfaction on the part of the right,  the Seimas education committee made the decision to give each  political party air time proportionate to the number of members  it had in the Seimas. The right, which had initially concurred,  later reconsidered and abandoned this proposal, demanding that  the opposition be assigned a special weekly slot of air time.  Then the majority of Seimas members supported the Radio and  Television Board proposal not to allot special slots to any  political party, nor to the opposition or the government.    Does the fact that neither side has its own program mean--in  the words of those on the right--that the LDDP has usurped the  radio and television?    People of various political persuasions work on the Radio  and  Television Board, but most of them do not belong to political  parties. Does the presence of 2 LDDP representatives and 1  social democrat in a body of 16 members really constitute  domination by the left?    According to the Radio and Television Charter, the board  establishes the political and cultural strategy for broadcasts  (II. sec. 9.4.). The representatives of the right, e.g., S.  Saltenis, N. Ozelyte, V. Landsbergis, and others criticize the  board's work, accusing it of inaction, lack of national topics,  etc. It may be that the board is not sufficiently active, but  that is the fault of its own members, one of whom is N. Ozelyte.  I also do not like all the broadcasts that are on television and  radio; however, I believe that those responsible for the poor  work are the specific people who prepare those broadcasts.    How much and what kind of political information is presented  is a different matter. It is perhaps possible to say that the  broadcast programs confine themselves to quite narrow  commentaries. In addition, those invited to comment are people  whose opinions on most issues have been known for a long time.  What is missing are some markedly more diverse opinions,  educated dispute, and most importantly, serious and objective  analysis of political events. This I believe is essential,  because it would help people orient themselves with respect to  rather complex international as well as domestic events. There  are enough qualified political scientists in Lithuania, who, if  invited to appear on radio or television, could help form the  country's political culture.    Do the representatives of political parties or the  opposition  have absolutely no opportunity to use the radio and the  television?    In listening to daily radio programs, e.g. "Aktualijos"  ["Topical Issues"], one can almost always hear the voices of  well-known politicians from the right. There has never been an  instance when only representatives of the left talked about  political events on the informational television broadcasts,  especially on the program "Naujienos. Nuomones" ["News and  Opinions"]. We also see representatives of both sides on special  political broadcasts.    It is possible, of course, to understand the annoyance of  active politicians from the right, since they can't make use of  state television in the same way that they make use of the  "Tele-3" studio. But those on the left should be even more  disappointed, because they have to be content with only the  attention of journalists from state television.    Therefore, assertions that the LDDP has usurped radio and  television are fabricated. If we were to consider it usurping  that we frequently see the president and the prime minister on  our television screens, then we would also have to term as  usurpers of our television the heads of other countries, who are  shown during the overview of international events.

headline:    New Chief Editor of Lietuvos Aidas Interviewed 
text:  Language:   Lithuanian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with S. Saltenis, new chief editor of LIETUVOS   AIDAS, by Kestutis Simonavicius; place and date not given: "`I  Ended Up Here Very Unexpectedly', Says Seimas Member Who Has  Become the New Head of LIETUVOS AIDAS"]    [Text] LIETUVOS RYTAS has already written about the changes  on the LIETUVOS AIDAS editorial staff and has published an  interview with S. Stoma, who was recently released from his  duties as chief editor of that daily newspaper. Today we present  an interview with S. Saltenis, the new chief editor of LIETUVOS  AIDAS.    [Simonavicius] Will LIETUVOS AIDAS change now that there is  a  new chief editor?    [Saltenis] You'll be able to judge by reading LIETUVOS  AIDAS.  However, there is no doubt that when a director comes to a  theater, he imbues it with his own guidelines and his own  character.    Those who know me, my views, and my manner can easily  imagine  what the newspaper will be like. I view the newspaper as a  certain component part of culture and of our collective creative  work, and will without doubt try to ensure that the newspaper  comprises an aspect of culture. I dream about a newspaper which  contains information, information, and more information, and in  which commentary appears separately and only after the  information has been presented.    [Simonavicius] Will there be a turnover in the ranks of  journalists at LIETUVOS AIDAS now that you have become the chief  editor?    [Saltenis] I really am a vegetarian, not a cannibal. I have  always said and still say that I can work with anyone, because  each person has creativity. This is something I know back from  my days in the Young People's Theater.    There are times when it seems as if an actor is downtrodden,  doesn't accomplish anything or display anything for 10 years;  however, one has to have the ability to unlock him, to somehow  awaken him, to find a place, topic, part for him.    This is why I think that the composition of the editorial  staff might change only in the event that some people are simply  not working, or forbid the thought, undertake to harm the  newspaper on purpose. However, I do not believe that this will  be the case.    [Simonavicius] A few years ago, you and S. Stoma were the  founders of SIUARES ATENAI and worked together there. How did it  come about that you are now replacing S. Stoma?    [Saltenis] Perhaps it is fate. I never thought or knew that  S. Stoma was like that, just as I also was not acquainted with  A. Juozaitis, who was also among the founders of SIAURES ATENAI.    [Simonavicius] The former editor maintained that the  Conservative Party was involved in his dismissal. Can you  confirm or deny this?    [Saltenis] I cannot. I also have no intention of concealing  that I am a member and a founder of the Fatherland  Union-Conservative Party. However, it would be stupid of me--and  it would also harm the newspaper and Lithuania's press as a  whole--if I envisioned LIETUVOS AIDAS as a party newspaper.    [Simonavicius] S. Stoma has indicated that SIAURES ATENAI  was  an unprofitable newspaper, but he managed to buy $60,000 worth  of LIETUVOS AIDAS shares.    [Saltenis] It would be great if SIAURES ATENAI would have  that much money and could support other newspapers. However,  SIAURES ATENAI is an unprofitable newspaper and stays on its  feet thanks to donations and supporters. S. Stoma is apparently  a fine economist and businessman, but such things are of little  interest to me.    S. Saltenis will channel all the money received from various  existing and future funds supporting the democratic press into  LIETUVOS AIDAS, and will not take one cent of this amount. S.  Saltenis will truly not cost LIETUVOS AIDAS a cent, because he  will work without salary, as he has also worked up to now at  SIAURES ATENAI.    [Simonavicius] All this notwithstanding, where did you get  the money to buy LIETUVOS AIDAS shares?    [Saltenis] There is no money yet, there are only supporters.    [Simonavicius] Can you specifically name those supporters?    [Saltenis] I will be able to say more precisely later, when  these matters are settled. I am not taking care of this  personally. However, the money will not be deposited for the  purpose of making a profit on it; the money will stay in  LIETUVOS AIDAS.    [Simonavicius] How will you coordinate the responsibilities  you have as a member of Seimas, as a member of the board of a  private company, and as a newspaper editor? Doesn't this  conflict with the Constitution?    [Saltenis] There are, I believe, a number of Seimas members  who head companies, firms, and newspapers. This question had not  occurred to anyone up to now, because those members of Seimas  belonged to the governing majority. However, if the type of  problem to which you refer were to emerge, there would be a  variety of ways to go about solving it, about which I would  gladly inform you.    I ended up here very unexpectedly and these are very  difficult days for me now. A lot of psychological preparation  has to go into something like this, and that is a great  hardship, one which I wouldn't wish on anyone.

headline:    Lithuanian Radio, TV Chief on Political Fairness, Government Relations 
text:  Language:   Lithuanian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Laimonas Tapinas, General Director of Lithuanian   Radio and Television: "If There Is Dissatisfaction With  Television, Let's Talk About Money"]    [Text] At one evening party, after all topics of  conversation had been exhausted, someone suggested in jest: "And  now, let's talk about television...". And indeed, conversation  revived right away, because everyone had something to say on  this issue.    A similar situation, it seems, exists in the public at  large.  It is annoying, though, that the scolding we receive is  sometimes simply invalid, or that sometimes the most absurd  accusations are levelled against us.    Some maintain that nothing has changed at Lithuanian Radio  and Television, that the "Landsbergisites" are in charge and  running things, just as before. Others, on the contrary, are  angry that the LDDP is running things as if it owned the place,  while opposition politicians are not even allowed in through the  door... I admit that I react to all this shedding of tears much  more playfully: if both sides are dissatisfied, well then,  that's not bad, we are probably succeeding in maintaining a  balance and in trying to achieve the goal we have set for  ourselves--above all else, to provide information that is  objective and free of any partisan politics.    With respect to political broadcasts, we intend to seek a  balance and to do our best to ensure that the representatives of  all political forces are able to express their opinion on  Lithuanian Radio and Television. We want to structure our  broadcasts so that that there is dialog instead of accusations  made in the absence of one's opponent. And let the viewers  decide who is right.    But maybe these are just our wishes? How are things in  reality? Let's look at the numbers.    Last year, 247 LDDP representatives, 218 members of the  right  opposition, and 175 members of parties with a centrist  orientation spoke on Lithuanian radio. The proportion on  television worked out to be pretty much the same: LDDP - 93, the  right - 98, the center (social democrats, Center Union,  liberals, etc.) -64. Among individual politicians, those talking  most frequently on the radio were C. Jursenas (46 times), V.  Landsbergis and G. Vagnorius (34 times each), G. Kirkilas (30),  J. Karosas (25), A. Kubilius (18), V. Jarmolenka (17). On  television, the viewers most frequently saw V. Landsbergis (8  times), R. Ozolas and G. Pavirzis (7 times each), J. Bernatonis  and S. Peceliunas (6 times each), etc. This statistical  compilation does not include those politicians who spoke briefly  in our informational broadcasts, nor does it include President  A. Brazauskas or Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, who spoke not as  representatives of a political force, but as the highest  officials in Lithuania.    How might one assess these numbers? Keeping them in mind, it  is difficult to understand the short-tempered statements made  both here and abroad by the National Harmony-Conservatives of  Lithuania party to the effect that it is not able to make use of  the national radio and television. I could more readily say--in  self-criticism--that it is not normal that a group which lost  the elections in devastating fashion spoke on television even  more frequently than the representatives of the ruling party.  Simply giving in to noisy protest campaigns--and in the name of  peace--our producers apparently invited the conservatives to  appear on radio and television more frequently than ought to  have been done on the basis of their political weight in the  Seimas.    This is even more valid with respect to the people from the  small moderate political parties, who had the opportunity to use  the airwaves not very much less than the two large parties.    A few words should also be said about the relationship  between the national government and Lithuanian Radio and  Television. I could characterize it as normal. Neither the  government leadership nor the Seimas meddled in our affairs or  tried to direct us, palm off their opinions on us, or call us  "on the carpet", something which was entirely customary two or  three years ago. And still, the fact that our relations are  businesslike and normal today does not yet mean that they will  remain that way tomorrow, nor that at some time after a change  in government, the new leaders of Lithuania will not want to  take advantage of the charter for state radio and television.  This is why I am uneasy.    And even if the government does not make any big demands  directly, the constant danger of this happening will always  remain, because the financing of radio and television will  depend on the governing structures, and even on the views of a  single high official, who might say: "You criticized the  government and didn't do what it wanted, and we're cutting  several million litas from your budget..." In other words,  state radio and television and their programs will depend on the  government whether they want to or not.    Avoiding this kind of dependence, our colleagues in western  Europe changed to a public status for radio and television a  good 10 years ago. That is also the direction in which all of  the post-communist countries of Central Europe are headed, and  some (e.g., Poland), have even already gone through the legal  steps to make this status official.    And what is this public radio and television? First and  foremost, it is an entity independent of government structures,  and this independence is guaranteed by law. The government  neither approves nor dismisses the administrative leadership  running radio and television. This leadership tries to work in a  way that satisfies the public interest and it is accountable to  a collective body composed of representatives from all segments  of society and various political forces, representatives who are  elected in accordance with the law and without any interference  by the government.    But most important is the fact that public radio and  television is nowhere financed out of a government's budget. In  most European countries, the funds are accumulated from  subscriber fees and advertising. I doubt that this method of  financing would be acceptable for Lithuania, given its difficult  economic situation. Supplemental taxes (20-25 litas per month  for a family) would be difficult to bear for our people, which  is why we are suggesting that we take advantage of the  experience of Turkey, Israel, Egypt, Cyprus, and other countries  whose economies were quite unstable just a short time ago. In  those countries, the budget of the national public radio and  television is composed of direct and legally defined deductions  from revenues received for electrical energy. An individual  family scarcely notices such taxes, and the radio and television  have a stable budget that is independent of inflation and allows  them to plan at least a few years in advance without worrying  about the whims of this government or that.    In its "Signs of the Times" column on 2 January 1993,  LIETUVOS RYTAS asks whether public status "would help improve  the quality of broadcasts on Lithuanian television?" I am not so  naive that I would immediately rush to respond: "yes!" With the  Lithuanian cinema and theater dying, in view of the fact that  literature, music, and art are going through a crisis, and with  envy, anger, and intolerance having spread out into society, it  is hard to imagine that the day after its change in status,  radio and television would begin to shine with sublime,  inspired, and interesting broadcasts... That's not the way  things are, that's not the way things can be. Our radio and  television are as we ourselves are. And still, in preparing a  program, if we wouldn't have to keep one eye out for the  government, if we would have enough technical equipment, if we  could afford to pay the actor or the writer who was invited to  be on the broadcast a decent fee, and not a miserable 3-4 litas,  then it would be possible to demand a different quality of  broadcast. In this regard, a public status for Lithuanian radio  and television could really help quite a bit.

headline:    Deputies Assess Amnesty, Yeltsin Address 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Statements by State Duma deputies: "Civil Peace or Verdict   on the Reforms?"]    [Excerpts] Two events in the past week--the State  Duma's amnesty decision and the president's annual report to the  two chambers of the Federal Assembly--have disturbed the  relative calm of the country's political life. We have offered  political scientists, journalists, and deputies themselves a  chance to comment on them. Readers will easily see for  themselves that the first event preoccupies our respondents  considerably more. And this is natural because with the release  of the Lefortovo prisoners there has been a qualitative change  in the political situation in the country. And not for the  better, it would seem.  <H3>  Sergey Yushenkov, deputy of the State Duma (Russia's  Choice): The Role of the Government in Both Matters Is Enigmatic </H3>   The amnesty decree was adopted with numerous violations of  the standing orders, serious ones at that. I will cite just some  of them. Rybkin did not have the right to preside over the  sitting of the State Duma since he had presented the report. But  he employed the methods and means of the former Supreme Soviet  produced under the leadership of Ruslan Khasbulatov. It may be  said that Khasbulatov was set at liberty thanks to the methods  he employed in the Supreme Soviet. A second most flagrant  violation was that the decree was assumed as the basis,  amendments were submitted, many amendments were rejected, but at  least one amendment was adopted. That is, the decree should have  been put to the vote one more time, not as the basis this time  but as a whole. This was not done. The next violation was  connected with the fact that representatives of Russia's Choice  were not allowed to speak to the motion but supporters of the  amnesty, on the other hand, were recognized repeatedly. Thus the  decree, which was adopted with the most flagrant violations of  the standing orders, has no legal validity. This was not,  unfortunately, noticed by the representatives of the president,  this was not noticed by the prosecutor general. Although we can  agree with their interpretation of the Constitution, amnesty is,  truly, the prerogative of the State Duma, not the president.  Though in this case the content of the amnesty goes beyond the  framework of amnesty proper, it was a pardon. And the latter is  the prerogative of the president.    The affiliation to the Communists, the Agrarians, and the  Zhirinovskiyites of the Shakhray faction, New Regional Policy,  and Women of Russia and their incantation to the effect that if  we adopt the amnesty decree, peace will reign in the country, is  at the least very naive and simply foolish. And it is surprising  that such a shrewd politician as Shakhray does not understand  this. It is most likely that he understands full well that it is  extraordinarily important for him currently to score points  before the presidential elections, but he has in this case lost  considerable popularity. The amnesty decree testifies also that  the pro-government grouping in parliament has strengthened. From  a number of indirect indications it may be said with a great  deal of confidence that Chernomyrdin's department was involved  in the adoption of this decree. The president had to have  noticed this, I believe.    The ministers, except for the members of Russia's Choice,  voted for the amnesty, as did the officials connected with the  government. There is also indirect evidence that the document  was looked over by the government's legal services. That is, the  government has thrown the president, we may say, an open  challenge. Whether he will take up the challenge or not it is  hard to say, although the statements he made, all too late, it  is true, testify that he has a very clear idea of the disastrous  nature of the decision. It essentially takes us back to a state  of, at best, uncertainty, at worst, the eve of civil war.    The act of amnesty showed very clearly that the State Duma  is, in effect, a second version of the Supreme Soviet, and this  is making the world community very leery. For the act of amnesty  is out-and-out antidemocratic.    It is frightening to imagine what would happen had the State  Duma retained the functions that had been assigned the Supreme  Soviet.    Now concerning the president's report. It contains a great  deal that requires analysis. Certain things connected with a  strengthening of the role of the state, for example, are  incomprehensible to me. It is clear, of course, that in such  spheres as the fight against crime and the problem of military  security and security in general the role of the state should be  increased. But when it is a question, say, of an increase in the  role of the state in the economy and when the putative  manifestation of this role is not deciphered, we could encounter  exclusively administrative methods. In his report the president  attempted to cover all aspects of life, but to be honest I did  not see in the document an aspiration to achieve decisive  changes, primarily in the sphere of the economy. And we have  just two paths--either a return to the old, command methods or  new steps forward, toward the market economy. Which one we  choose will be shown by the prime minister's report. And we may  then draw a conclusion as to what was, in fact, implied in the  president's report.    The fact that the opposition was quite well disposed toward  the report puts us on our guard also. It is entirely to its  liking. I by no means proceed from the principle that since this  suits the enemy, it should not, consequently, suit us. Not at  all. I have given the reasons why the report does not suit me or  why, at least, it requires some additional clarification. In  short, I personally can draw a final conclusion concerning the  report only after the president's response to the government's  program.  <H3>  Andrey Nuykin, Deputy of the State Duma (Russia's Choice):  From Zhirinovskiy's `Falcons' to Shakhray's `Falconets' </H3>   I have an ambivalent attitude toward the Duma's amnesty  decree.    First, the pompous statements it contains about "national  reconciliation, peace, and harmony" are utterly hypocritical.  You do not have to be a Seneca to understand that political  intriguers, putschists, street toughs, firebrands, killers, and  looters, set at liberty and absolved of responsibility for  bloody crimes, will enthusiastically join in the struggle for  the seizure of power, resorting to provocations, terror, mass  unrest, and destabilization in all walks of life. The formation  of a broad coalition of political forces--from Zhirinovskiy's  "falcons" to Shakhray's "falconets"--which was revealed in the  course of the preparation and adoption of the decree and which  has been bolstered by the appearance in the dirty political  kitchen of proven top-level intriguers and speculators with  Malinovskiy-like dreams of "civil peace" will find few friends.    Second, both the insipid response of the president to a  situation that once again reeks strongly of civil war and the  submissiveness with which our leaders of justice and law and  order revealed a readiness to agree with the incompetent and  criminal action of the State Duma are extremely surprising and  disheartening. Amnesty is not practiced in respect to specific  persons and crimes. It presupposes merely articles of the  Criminal Code and nonindividualized categories of crimes  (pregnant women, minors, and so forth). The Duma has in practice  assumed the function of granting a pardon (prior to the judicial  ascertainment of guilt, what is more). And a pardon, according  to the Constitution, may be granted only by the president. A.M.  Yakovlev, representative of the president in the Duma, together  with our esteemed Prosecutor General A. Kazannik, should have  known about such elementary legal "niceties."    Third, the Duma has shown itself completely by this action  to  be a socially dangerous force bent on the incitement of civil  war. Its basis is composed once again, alas, not of legislator  professionals but irresponsible political intriguers concerned  with struggle for their personal careers and party or clan  interests. The small group of consistent democrats will hardly  be in a position to neutralize their socially dangerous  activity. At the first constitutional possibility this Duma must  be dissolved. Otherwise we will once again have to get out of  political crises with the help of tanks, Alphas, and other  unconstitutional mechanisms.  <H3>  Viktor Sheynis, Deputy of the State Duma (`Yabloko'  faction): Both a Thief and a Terrorist Are Equal? </H3>   The amnesty decree is one of the most important decisions  adopted by parliament since it started business. But it is  fraught with serious complications and dangers. The "Yabloko"  faction, of which I am a member, decided when preliminarily  discussing this question that it could not support this decree,  and not one member of our faction voted for it. We are for  national reconciliation and a policy of compromise, of course.  But it should be pursued between those who can, are capable of,  and are prepared to agree to compromise. This is an essential  condition, which in this case was not observed.    It is significant that the speech of the leader of the  Communist faction during discussion of this matter was of a  clearly expressed peremptory nature. He interpreted national  reconciliation as a form, virtually, of capitulation before the  onslaught of quite aggressive forces close to the participants  in those events.    The mere principle of the unification of heterogeneous  documents and heterogeneous groups of convicted persons in a  single "package" evokes objections. Essentially, the decision  was adopted in respect to three different groups of convicts.  First, persons convicted of various criminal offenses, so to  speak. I say "so to speak" because our Criminal Code does not  draw a distinction between criminal offensives proper and crimes  of this political aspect or the other. The point of departure  for the decision was a draft that had been sent by the  president. It was properly drawn up from both the formal and  substantive viewpoints, incidentally. The Legislation Committee  performed certain additional work, excluding from the list of  those amnestied audacious hooligans and persons who had  committed rape. In this form the document was perfectly  satisfactory, and it should have been supported.    The second group is composed of so-called economic crimes  and  persons convicted, in fact, for private entrepreneurial,  commercial, and brokerage activity. Activity that is essentially  now perfectly legal. These people should have been released long  ago, and they are mentioned in the draft.    And, finally, the most contentious section of those  amnestied--the participants in the events of August 1991 and May  and October 1993.    Setting free and dropping the charges against people who  destabilized the political situation evoke misgivings in  themselves.    But there is one further aspect making support for this  document absolutely unacceptable. The part of it that pertained  to political amnesty was compiled in a legally improper manner.  For example, the list of persons to be amnestied was determined  with insufficient precision. And there is for me a very  considerable difference between, say, the political leaders who  called from the White House balcony for an assault on Ostankino,  city hall, and the Kremlin and the combatants. The call was  undoubtedly criminal. But, nonetheless, an appeal in itself is a  crime of one nature, and the organization of the gangs of toughs  who carried out the attack on Ostankino and city hall and who  were prepared to seize a number of official institutions is a  crime of an entirely different sort. I refer to such ringleaders  of the armed gangs as Messrs Anpilov, Barkashov, Terekhov, and  certain others. In respect to these people the amnesty is, in my  view, extremely dangerous. For these people will hardly be  capable of appreciating the humanity of the action that was  taken. They will, most likely, continue what they were doing in  the days leading up to the event.    Under these conditions we were put in a very difficult  position. I could not support this political amnesty decision in  the form in which it was presented, but nor could I vote against  the president's amnesty draft or, most important, against the  release of the people accused of economic crimes. It seems to me  that the president's position on this matter is distinguished by  somewhat of an uncertain and improper approach. He should have  anticipated that in sending the bill to the Duma, other groups  of people would obviously have been mixed in with his draft, and  he should have responded to this not when the Duma had already  adopted a decision.    The most deplorable aspect in this event, perhaps, was the  disconnection of the democratic forces in parliament and the  role which the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction  headed by Sergey Shakhray performed in the organization of this  "package." I find totally unconvincing the belated explanations  disseminated the next day by K. Zatulin, a leader of this  faction. The problem of the unity of the democratic forces on  matters of principle remains extraordinarily pertinent. For  unless we find understanding among ourselves, at the 1966  presidential elections (or, God forbid, sooner) we will find  ourselves in a situation similar to that in which the Germans  found themselves at the 1932 presidential elections, choosing  between Hindenburg and Hitler.  <H3>  Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, Deputy of the State Duma (`Yabloko':  Yeltsin Could Have Determined Events </H3>   Four documents were put to the vote in the Duma in a single  package. It was against this that I, on behalf of our faction,  spoke from the Duma rostrum. We can only agree with the call for  civil reconciliation, but it is very important to ascertain: Who  is reconciling with whom. Reconciliation between, say, nouveaux  riches or embezzlers of state funds, who have plundered public  money, and the humiliated and the insulted, who have been  brought to the brink of destitution?    It can only be a question, of course, of reconciliation  between the opposition and the president. But watching the  release of Anpilov and Makashov, it does not seem that these  people, who have blood on their hands, aspire to such  reconciliation.    We are opposed to the release of people who besmirched  themselves by criminal offenses during the tragic days at the  start of last October. Mr. Zhirinovskiy himself declared that  some have fled to neighboring republics, fearing criminal  prosecution.    In addition, there are no grounds for terminating the  investigation of the events of September-October 1993, which has  been sought also by such irreproachable public figures as  Mikhail Gefter. This is why our faction did not support this  package of documents and preferred either to vote against it or  to abstain.    I would like to add that not only is it unlikely that  reconciliation, about which the general document speaks, will be  achieved, the political struggle will merely intensify. The  prospect of the tranquil cohabitation of the presidency and the  legislature does not emerge, unfortunately.    Several months ago, participating in the work of the  so-called Krasavchenko group formed by the leader of the Office  of the President, I proposed that the president himself release  the political prisoners through an edict of his. The suggestion  was rejected by my colleagues. A situation where this act has  been accomplished by the Duma, not the president, has come  about. Had this been done by the president, he would today be  determining the development of the situation.    At the same time accord could be achieved, although there is  little chance of this, if parliament occupies its proper place  and if there are no petty impediments in the way of its  functioning like, for example, the unresolved problem of the  location of the Duma. Ultimately it was the presidential  structures that drew up the new Constitution, and did they not  write that an act of amnesty was the prerogative of parliament?    Nonetheless, I hope for the president's cooperation, as  before. It is important that they not throw up obstacles to one  another inasmuch as their new antagonism would have a baneful  effect on the state of society. [passage omitted]  <H3>  Gennadiy Zyuganov, Deputy of the State Duma (Communist Party  of Russia): Very Timely Decree </H3>   The decree had a very difficult birth, but I consider its  adoption exceptionally opportune for a number of reasons.    The events of August 1991 and May and September-October 1993  were of a clearly expressed political nature. These events were  primarily a consequence of the destructive and splittist policy  that had been pursued by the national leadership in the person  of Gorbachev and Yeltsin. If this ball unravels any more, there  will be no end to it.    There has been a mass stoppage of production, unemployment  has in a number of places amounted to almost 30 percent, half  the population is not being paid on time, merely 20 percent of  the peasantry is ready for the sowing on account of the  nonpayments to the peasants for the grain they have surrendered,  and the mass strike movement of the miners, students, and  lecturers is growing. It would seem to me that under these  conditions the State Duma has taken the first step toward  national reconciliation, without which we will not accomplish a  single task.    It seemed to me that the radical democrats, who are  responsible for the policy of devastation of the country that  has been pursued in recent years, the civil wars throughout the  south of Russia, and the events that occurred in October in  Russia, should have been satisfied with this decision the most.    The president avoided a direct evaluation of it in his  report. But Yeltsin's aides subjected the Duma's decision simply  to outright ostracism. And as far as certain journalists are  concerned, one has the impression that peace and harmony in  Russia are absolutely not what they want. If they do not realize  that this is for everyone the last peaceful way out of the  situation, they will bring down on their heads troubles for  which neither the country nor their nearest and dearest will  forgive them.    We have issued the appropriate statement: Hysteria is being  deliberately incited and a provocation prepared in order to  frustrate the first steps toward reconciliation. I am sure that  both other factions and the leadership of the Duma will respond.  The laws the Duma adopts cannot be treated this way.    Concerning the president's report. It seems to me that those  who prepared it and the president himself were out of the  country for three years. Then they suddenly saw that Russia  needs strong statehood, that crime is raging, that science and  culture are in a dire state, that corruption has conquered all,  and that the bureaucracy has grown incredibly.    Yeltsin's report might have been deemed satisfactory had it  been heard in February-March 1991. There would not then have  been the collapse of the USSR, there would have been no  Belovezha pact, there would have been no tragedy in the Caucasus  even, there would have been no universal impoverishment.    On the other hand, the report was delivered in a tone  (tough-confrontational) which was untraditional for Yeltsin. It  contains a recognition that he also is responsible for what has  been done and that continuing the course of shock therapy to the  point of total shock is impossible--the total destabilization of  the situation would ensue. Thank God that this, at least, was  heard. But any declaration needs to be bolstered by a specific  program. [passage omitted]

headline:    Reforms Movement Leader Ties Yeltsin Team to Amnesty Plan 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Russian Movement   for Democratic Reform, under the "In the Corridors of Power"  rubric: "The Amnesty"]    [Text] The release from prison of the leaders of the  October rebellion caused jubilation among some and shock among  others. Many unequivocally see this amnesty as a huge defeat for  the president of Russia. Let us try to sort out what is  happening on stage, and what--behind the scenes.    In the course of discussing the amnesty, Shakhray's party,  which lays the greatest claim on being considered "Yeltsinite"  and "Chernomyrdinite" and includes several government ministers  as well as a de facto deputy prime minister and member of the  Security Council, suddenly supported the amnesty. One cannot  assume for a second that leaders who are willing to go any  length to attain for their party the status of a presidential  party would act this way without consultations at the very top.  Especially considering that Shakhray's party switched its  position toward support of the amnesty precisely when it became  clear that opposition factions could not get the amnesty for  Lefortovo prisoners to pass on their strength alone.    Kazannik could have threatened to resign before the Duma  vote. He did not. On the contrary, he encouraged the Duma: I  will carry out its decision.    Next. The general procurator resigned after he released the  prisoners. He clearly was "played up" to his successor,  relieving him of making the critical decision.    There was another, behind-the-scenes process behind public  actions. What, precisely?    It would be to the advantage of the new leaders of the Duma  opposition to free the "old-timers" in such a way that the  latter would have stayed in secondary roles or left politics  altogether. Therefore, Duma members clearly would have waited  with the amnesty had not the administration rushed them.    The presidential circles were aware that against the  background of the government camp's falling authority  trials could play into the hands of the accused. We  cannot, after all, accuse someone of sabotaging shock therapy if  we have abandoned it ourselves. In short, the temptation to drop  the trials was growing. But they wanted very much to have  someone else make this happen. This would have relived the  administration of the need to provide explanations.    Since a majority of Duma deputies were bound by a commitment  to free the prisoners, this needed to been taken advantage of.  But the new opposition leaders were not the only ones who  preferred to push the prisoners into secondary roles--the  administration wanted the same. It was clear to those in the  administration that the opposition currently does not have a  common strong leader. And for new actors--and this the  administration also was aware of--it would take years to become  worthy contenders for the job of the president or the head of  the government in the eyes of the people. Therefore, the  administration was more afraid of those members of the  opposition who were facing the trial than those sitting in the  Duma.    One can easily see a release being granted on condition not  to participate in political activities and elections until the  next presidential and Duma election as a scenario acceptable to  both parties to the amnesty. But this obvious version of amnesty  was not realized. Why?    The presidential team always had skillfully used the  factor of fear before the opponents of the reform. At the  referendum in April 1993 they managed to reduce everything to a  fight between the two camps--of supporters and opponents of the  reform. During the September-October crisis they also managed to  create a situation of confrontation. In December, however, no  matter how Russia's Choice tried to put together a single bloc,  no matter how it tried to present the elections as a fight  between two forces, it failed. After the election, a hysterical  campaign of fighting the threat of fascism began. The idea  was quite old: First drive all the democrats under the banner of  anti-fascism, and then into the pro-president bloc.    The administration still has not given up on the idea of  "uniting" out of fear for the fate of the reform. But how  to produce such fear? The course of the reform had been  such that the fear for the fate of reform had been increasingly  associated with the administration's incompetency. Nobody feared  Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov. Hence came the idea to free the  GKChP [State Committee on the State of Emergency] members and  the Octobrists in order to restore the situation of psychosis,  hysteria, and fear among the democratic forces. This was the  desire that prompted the administration to go ahead with an  unconditional amnesty.    It will be necessary, of course, to dramatize the amnesty.  "Betrayal" on the part of one of the presidential parties (the  most obedient one will play this role, of course). The  "dramatic" resignation of the general procurator.  "Disagreements" among advisers and aides. Panic in the ranks of  Russia's Choice. Democratic Russia getting hysterical. The  purpose of this all is to scare both the people, all democrats,  and the West. Then chances of gaining from the amnesty increase.    So what did the high contracting parties--the presidential  team and the Duma--agree on? Let me sketch a probable blueprint.  They could not fail to consider three scenarios for the  development of events.    Scenario No. 1. "Ideological Fighters." Not  wishing to acknowledge themselves guilty, the accused reject the  amnesty and demand a trial. A scenario that is most dangerous  for both sides. It leads to a rising authority of the accused,  which neither the presidential not the deputy side want.    Scenario No. 2. "Second Roles." After the release,  some prisoners will leave politics altogether for now, while  others will settle for the roles offered to them by the new  opposition leaders. This is not the worst scenario for the  presidential side, since this produces a "watch thy brother"  situation, and amnestied extremist leaders find themselves under  the control of more moderate Duma leaders.    Scenario No. 3. "Old Leaders." Released extremists  do not settle for second roles. But the Duma is occupied. Then  they have to regain their position outside the Duma, in the  streets. The situation in the country is exacerbated sharply.    In this case the Duma with clear conscience "surrenders"  these incorrigible and ungrateful "heroes of street  fist-fighting" (using I.P. Rybkin's term) to the administration.  This scenario would suit the administration best. This they can  use to scare both reform supporters and the West. They can even  push through approval for a state of emergency.    One would think--so what! Politics is impossible without  games and cunning. But in reality the situation is not all that  harmless.    First, the third scenario, which is most  realistic, may lead to a dangerous development of events--if  they remain passive, if the mood in the Army is uncertain and  reformist forces refuse to unite to the crack of the  administration's "whip."    Second, the voters, tired of attempts to make  policy behind their backs, may lose the last shreds of  confidence in both the president's administration and the  president himself. Having realized that they have been  manipulated, supporters of reforms may stop responding to  appeals for support.    Third, the exacerbation of the situation caused by  extremist actions of those amnestied, and their second  incarceration, will not create the public background so greatly  needed in already difficult negotiations on coalition.    To overcome this danger, the administration does not have to  reject the amnesty. It needs, first, to severely limit the  spectrum of potential actions of the former Lefortovo prisoners.  Both with respect to their right to participate in political  activities and with respect to the right to be elected.  The Duma ought to pass amendments to the amnesty  decision. For instance, that some of those granted amnesty  are barred from obtaining a Moscow residency permit; some--from  engaging in activities involving commodity and material values;  and so on, and so on.    And second: Constructive forces in society and the  presidential team should not wait for events to develop, but  should anticipate them by expanding the work on forming a  national coalition of supporters of reform.    What is needed, however, is unity that is based on a  constructive foundation instead of fear. Unity on the basis of  agreement with, rather than subordination to, the  administration.    I remember Korney Chukovskiy's poem "Fedora's Trouble." This  Fedora let her house get into such bad shape that all the dishes  ran away from her. Fedora kept trying to frighten the escapees  with all sorts of horrors--that they would get lost, drown in  the bog, etc. But this policy of fear did not work. Fedora  finally won by promising to radically rid the house of all the  old dirt. And then the dishes came back.

But is it really so?  <H5>  The Duma and Its `Harmlessness' </H5>   The State Duma's central apparat is about to exceed the size  of that under Khasbulatov. Counter to the Constitution, I.  Rybkin is becoming a political figure of significance. Strangely  enough, B. Yeltsin himself, as well as V. Chernomyrdin, is  helping him in that. They interact not with the Duma council, as  they are supposed to, but with him personally.    The first most important stage--the takeover of the Duma  apparat--may be considered a fait accompli. Which means: Its  tremendous transportation capabilities (up to the use of private  airlines); access to all government and military objects;  equipping their offices with all sorts of government  communications; the right to summon to the Duma any officials;  and so on.    Next on the agenda is the removal of the main political  opponent--B. Yeltsin. It is possible in principle? They need the  support of only 20-25 more deputies to reach the 298 votes  needed to impeach the president.  <H5>  The Kremlin and Its `Geniuses' </H5>   Let us leave the president himself outside our commentary.  As  is known, the retinue makes the king. How did it behave in the  amnesty incident? Presidential advisers G. Satarov and Yu.  Baturin undoubtedly are good as political scientists of the  "Itogi" program, but in this case, with the help of that same  television, they have demonstrated an inability to make  on-the-spot decisions. It was disappointing and strange to  realize that sometimes they did not know what was happening  right next to them.    The president's Chief of Staff, S. Filatov, did not make his  position clear, either. The same goes for R. Orekhov, chief of  the state-legal administration (GPU).    As is known, the style of B. Yeltsin's retinue is to react  frantically to events that have already happened. So today rush  preparations are being made for the president's television  address. The resignation of General Procurator A. Kazannik has  been accepted. It came to the point that the president finally  fired the head of the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service]  (formerly the KGB) N. Golushko. The investigative detention  facility in Lefortovo was under the latter's jurisdiction. Let  us remind our readers that B. Yeltsin had not dared to do this  even after the October events, when the MB [Ministry of  Security] demonstratively stayed out of the fray.  <H6>  * * * * </H6>   One very much wants to believe that the Kremlin is  conducting  a sophisticated and farsighted policy. But the doubt persists:  Are we not witnessing unpreparedness and confusion among the  Kremlin chiefs as we did in the beginning of the October  rebellion in Moscow?

headline:    Aleksey Kiva Views Amnesty, Possible Consequences 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Aleksey Kiva under rubric "At the Crossroads of   Opinions": "Amnesty: Pros and Cons"]    [Text] I tend to associate our stormy political life  simultaneously with American roller-coasters and Russian  swashbuckling horseback races. Here, as a rule, there are both  sudden sharp, nerve-tingling curves and people tumbling from the  saddle. Just a few days ago public attention zeroed in on the  President's State of the Nation message to the Federal Assembly.  Then, after barely having time to discuss it meaningfully, we,  voluntarily or involuntarily, switched our attention to the  development of the plot spawned by the amnesty. And now we are  suddenly faced with the fact of the precipitous release from  Lefortovo Prison of Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ruslan Khasbulatov,  Albert Makashov, Viktor Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov, and other  instigators of the bloody October events and Mayday clashes,  which also had casualties. Also absolved of punishment,  regardless of the court's decision, are the organizers of the  unsuccessful August coup. At the same time, Procurator-General  Aleksey Kazannik was relieved of his position, albeit ostensibly  at his own request.    But let us get away from emotions and make an effort to  comprehend all this, taking into account, among other things,  the subsequent "exposure" of the ex-procurator.    First, what actually happened? The Duma passed a decree in  full conformity with the Constitution, though one could, of  course, argue where amnesty ends and pardon begins and what,  actually, are the prerogatives of the Duma and the President.  But such a debate would surely be unproductive. What guided the  Duma, or more precisely, the majority of its members? As the  decree states, objectives of "national reconciliation,  achievement of civil peace and concord." We can assume that it  had other, or even entirely different, objectives. More  precisely, some deputies were really guided by the idea of  reconciliation, some were moved by revenge, some pursued their  personal or group political goals, including setting their  sights on the presidential election, some cherished the goal of  destabilizing the situation, and so on. So what? That is real  politics, the vector of which is the sum of the actions and  reactions of many interests.    It is another question how the Constitution could make such  a  sensitive, multidimensional problem as amnesty, moreover at such  a complex, transitional stage from one social system to another,  the sole prerogative of the Duma? But, Messrs. comrades, who is  to blame but those who drew up the draft Constitution and  introduced the final amendments to it? Tantrums should have been  thrown then; now it's too late. Or, perhaps, at the time people  had forgotten about Lefortovo?    Second. Every complex matter has its pros and cons. Let us  start with the latter. With the cons, for it is precisely they  that are now arousing public opinion. Of concern is precisely  what Kazannik spoke of in his resignation statement. It is  dangerous and immoral to set free people who are guilty of the  death and injuries of many people and of causing considerable  material damage. Yes, that is so. Evil must be punished, because  otherwise it tends to spread like a cancerous tumor.  Essentially, the bloody October events became possible only  because the organizers of the bloody May events had remained  unpunished, and before them, the organizers of the Ostankino  pogroms. The "implacable opposition" was quite openly preparing  for violent actions with virtually no significant opposition. On  the contrary, it was wholeheartedly supported by the former  Supreme Soviet and enjoyed its patronage, coupled with the fact  that the procurator's office and court mishandled things, and  even now we find that the Procurator-General, whose resignation  was swiftly accepted by the President, acted inappropriately.  Clearly, the amnesty was poorly handled. The procurator, for his  part, either did nothing or remained aloof and then acted too  hastily. Why? Another mystery. It is something of a conundrum:  By its very logic, amnesty presumes the guilt of the person to  whom it applies, whereas Khasbulatov--and he is not  alone--vociferously declares that he doesn't consider himself  guilty, that he suffered in the fight for freedom. In other  words, there is neither punishment nor remorse. In purely  Russian style.    The worrisome thing is that the people coming out of  Lefortovo Prison may take up their old cause. Anpilov has  already declared, in his purely public rally manner, that if,  having gained freedom, he sees that prices are declining, then  he'll concede the correctness of Boris Yeltsin's course, but if  they rise, then he will raise the masses. And he has already  taken part in a rally.    Theoretically, there is the danger of inflaming passions in  society and destabilizing the political situation in view of the  mounting dissatisfaction with the practice of delaying wages,  persistent problems of reciprocal nonpayment, the state of  affairs in the economy as a whole, and the disastrous situation  of many "budgeteers."    There is a threat that the people coming out of Lefortovo  will assemble a powerful opposition movement on a  national-patriotic platform, a platform of counter-reform, and  will seek to unite with the "implacable" in parliament. They  will try to shift their main actions to the streets, inciting  mass strikes, organizing disobedience campaigns, demanding a  complete change in the course of reforms, and even an early  presidential election. A hypothetical leader of the opposition  is already being named: Aleksandr Rutskoy.    Such apprehensions are already being expressed in the mass  media, and I hear them from colleagues of mine, including  like-minded people or people with views close to mine, with whom  I have recently been heatedly exchanging views. One of them  declared quite strongly: "The maneuver of President Yeltsin's  opponents in the Duma has succeeded. The amnesty is a defeat for  democrats. It is a victory for opposition forces; it is not  accidental, after all, that Vladimir Zhirinovksiy came to  Lefortovo specially to declare his solidarity with the leaders  of the October rebellion. As for those democrats who voted for  the amnesty, in particular Sergey Shakhray with his strategic  calculations of sorts, they have miscalculated. They simply  overplayed their hand."    Only the future will reveal the correctness of one side or  another, as well as who won, who lost, and who was duped. But  what should not, what must not be forgotten? Firstly, that the  Duma decree is a package. It includes not only the amnesty  (moreover, not only political, but also economic), but also  repeal of its previous decree of 16 February, "On Confirming the  Members of the Commission for Investigating the events of 21  September-4 October 1993." It goes without saying that such an  investigation would have excited public opinion no less than the  amnesty itself. The decree also includes a Memorandum of  Understanding, the significance of which should not be  overlooked. The MPs have declared to the country and the world:  "We are convinced of the impermissibility of destablizing the  situation in a country which possesses such a huge weapons  arsenal... Accordingly, we consider it necessary to engage in  political struggle strictly within the framework of the law and  not resort to, or in any form call for, violence, ethnic  discord, or the suppression of people holding different views."  If these are but empty words, then there is simply nothing to  talk about. In that case the political elite is beyond the pale  of civilization, beyond responsibility, in the power of  primitive instincts, barbarian "political culture," and a  society that brings forth such an elite can stop thinking of  democracy. Our fate is dictatorship, we are incapable of  anything else. But that is not really the case.    Secondly, one should not disregard the fact that the events  of August 1991 and October 1993 were of an unusual nature rarely  encountered in world practice. Therefore, despite their  similarity to many widespread phenomena, they should be treated  as something exceptional.    The human losses, spiritual, ethical, and in part even  political losses associated with the "shooting of the  parliament" were, I sincerely believe, forced actions to prevent  civil war and disintegration of the country, and they lie solely  on the conscience of those who first called people to arms.  Besides, we may have been at the threshold of a new terror. But  you must agree that all this took place in conditions of actual  dual power.    Thirdly, we have, apparently, not yet fully realized that we  are living under a new Constitution, that we no longer have an  almighty Supreme Soviet, and that in addition to the Duma we  also have a higher chamber, the Council of the Federation. Let  us suppose that Konstantinov, Anpilov or someone else would  really like to fish in muddy political waters for the sake of  that very "destabilization of the situation" mentioned in the  Memorandum. What would follow then? Why, if nothing else works,  the President would issue, with the approval of the upper  chamber, an edict declaring an emergency situation. Then no one  can tell him what to do! But if even then the situation gets out  of control, the problem would be not the Anpilovs or  Konstantinovs, but the bankruptcy of the political course  itself, the people's failure to comprehend the essence of reform.    But let us pose the question differently. Nonpayment of  wages  for months on end, chronic government debts for delivered  produce, a stalemate because of mutual nonpayments, and the  chaos pervading the economy in general: is all that normal and  acceptable? It is not, after all, our intention to carry out  reforms in the name of reforms and against the interests of  people. As I see it, the President in his message to parliament  considers such things completely abnormal and demands their  quickest elimination. Or perhaps it is normal that neither  Gaydar nor the people who have replaced him have deemed it  necessary to keep up a constant dialogue with the people.    We must explain to the people of Russia what kind of society  we want to build, what our ideals are, what our new spirituality  is. We should allay our compatriots' fears and give them  confidence in the future. So far nothing like this has really  been done.    Third, and here I am taking up what may be in favor of  "opting for": for positively resolving the question of the  amnesty as an important component of the package decree. It is  time for those who call themselves democrats, reformers, people  dedicated to a rule-of-law (socio-rule-of-law) state and to  market (socio-market) relations, who honor our traditions and  care for our national interests, to stop arguing, splintering,  and especially infighting. The society will soon lose any idea  of who is really a democrat. PRES [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord] voted for the amnesty and, it is said, decided its fate.  Also voting for it were "Women of Russia," "New Regional  Politics," all or most of the "Yabloko"  [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] faction, and many of those who can't  be called either anti-reform or anti-democratic. Actually, only  "Russia's Choice" voted against. It is logical to ask why there  is such divergence in the democratic camp? The reason is that  there are, among other things, different views of the events of  September-October 1993, and even, to some extent, of the events  of August 1991. So perhaps it would be reasonable to try and  bring them together, even at the risk of failure. Politics is  impossible without taking risks.    It is, actually, high time to recognize realities in the  broader aspect and get out of the cocoon of sectarianism. If the  concept of "democrats" is reduced to "Russia's Choice," what can  they do without forming blocs with other political forces and  making compromises with them? Retreat into total opposition or  prod the President towards some kind of actions? Frankly, I see  nothing positive along that road. Because in parliament there is  a certain balance of forces supported by certain moods of our  citizens. One can only blame oneself for inability to conduct a  dialog with the people and for mishandling the parliamentary  elections, roll up one's sleeves and work hard for the future.  As for the President himself, I consider that he acted quite  appropriately. There is no sense prodding him towards  confrontation with Duma members. After all, work with the  Parliament is only just beginning.    And one more thing. It may develop that the supporters of  reform would do well to accept speaker Rybkin's formula, which  he proposed during his address to Parliament on 28 February.  Essentially, the idea is to implement a program for getting out  of the economic crisis prepared within the Duma. Provided, of  course, that it is based not on intentions to abandon the course  of market reforms altogether or to create a "government of  national unity" made up of, say, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy and, perhaps, Anatoliy Chubays, which would lead to  the collapse of all and everything.    What, essentially, is of fundamental importance to  reformer-democrats? To preserve the democratic Constitution and  the strategic course of reforms. And also, to win the coming  presidential election.    Fourth. The amnesty will, in my view, hardly promote the  cohesion of extremist forces in society, and in this I tend to  agree more with Shakhray than with his critics. Of course, there  are still unknown quantities which make predictions difficult,  although much will get clearer in the very near future. However,  I have always considered--and so far have not changed my opinion  on this score--that as soon as Aleksandr Rutskoy appears on the  political scene Zhirinovskiy will fade away as a presidential  contender, literally before our eyes. When he voted for the  amnesty Vladimir Volfovich probably didn't even realize that he  was thereby placing a mine under his ambitious plans. But I do  not preclude the possibility that circumstances may force Boris  Yeltsin to once again enter the arena of struggle for the  presidency and, as the ancient Romans used to say, deserve his  triumph. But we still have to live up to that time.

headline:    Sobchak on Politics, Reform, Zhirinovskiy 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Roundtable discussion with St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy   Sobchak at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial offices; date not  given; published under the rubric "Club 206": "Anatoliy Sobchak:  It Hurts When a Great Power Has Such a Parliament"]    [Text] A. Udaltsov, editor in chief: Anatoliy  Aleksandrovich, you were one of the most prominent personalities  in our first (then all-Union) parliament. Tell us please, what  is your opinion of the current Federal Assembly?    A. Sobchak: Frankly, it hurts that a great power  has such a parliament. Unfortunately, many people who made it  there are absolutely unprepared for parliamentary work. There  are also people with a simply criminal mentality. We know that  so far the parliament has not adopted a single positive  decision. It is engaged in internal score-settling, endless  rallies, petty internal scandals, and defining its own status.    At the same time--and I have already said this more than  once  with different audiences--we are not seeing the results of the  12 December elections in the correct perspective. After all, we  did get a new Constitution and, for the first time, completely  different relations between citizen and state. Unfortunately,  very little is being said about this. Most importantly, for the  first time we held elections in an environment of a multiparty  system, by party lists (other than elections in single-seat  districts). Now about the results. In order for the results to  be different, we should have avoided mistakes--the government,  the president, and the political parties. But it was clear from  the very beginning that the new parliament would be a motley  crew.    Nevertheless, the elections did take place. There is a new  parliament. What its fate will be depends to a large extent on  itself. For me, the important part is that we will no longer be  in the same political dead end we have been in for more than two  years.    Looking back at the elections today, what remains to be done  is to analyze honestly, harshly, and objectively why the outcome  was completely different than that we had hoped for. When I say  "we," I mean politicians and organizations of a democratic  orientation. Nevertheless, we have taken a giant step down the  road of establishing democracy in Russia.    O. Moroz, editorial board member: It appears to me  that over the past two years you have faded as a politician. How  do you explain this? Are you counting on a second wind? Do you  intend to run for president in 1996? In your opinion, who will  be president?    A. Sobchak: Relatively faded... I myself do not  feel that I have faded... Because I have lived the last two  years at the limit of my abilities. I worked perhaps more, and  more actively, than previously in the parliament. When I came to  the parliament from academia, teaching seemed like leisure to  me. Now I am responsible for the life of a 5-million-strong  city, parliamentary work seems rather easy and free of  responsibilities. Here, the responsibility is different: You are  responsible for the life of a city where something happens every  day. Today it is a fire in the Admiralty; tomorrow an entire  rayon--300,000-400,000 people--is without heat, light, and  water. Or, for instance, the situation with purification  systems... City residents are not even aware of the situations  we encounter in the old city with decrepit communications.    That is why I perhaps do not participate in political life  as  actively as I did when I was a member of the Supreme Soviet and  the Congress. But I am involved in the work of the government,  the Presidential Council, and in drafting many decisions.    Being in power and having responsibility for the state of  the  city I could, of course, build up much greater popularity for  myself by criticizing decisions I disagreed with. Had I said in  the press and on television everything I say in the government  or at the Presidential Council, it would have given me much  greater popularity. There are things I could say and tell. But I  believe I should not do so. Because we are going through a very  difficult time. To hand over to the irreconcilable opposition my  own analysis of the mistakes and wrong decisions that have been  made, and are still being made, is to pour water on the mill of  the counter-reformers, the enemy (the latter definition is  simpler and more precise).    Over the past two years I have been asked many times whether  I intend to run in the presidential elections. And I have said  repeatedly for two years that I have a much simpler and more  modest task. I am facing reelection in 1996--the day the  president's term expires, my term as mayor also expires. Until  then I do not intend to go anywhere. I promised the people of my  city when I was running for mayor that I would work in the city  honestly and conscientiously for five years.    O. Moroz: What if Zhirinovskiy becomes president?    A. Sobchak: In the event the impossible does  happen and the country goes to Zhirinovskiy, I will do  everything I can to have Petersburg secede from Russia.    Now, about elections of a new president. Of course, we have  to start preparing for them now. As for myself, I am not  preparing for these elections for a number of reasons. One of  them is a superstitious feeling of self-preservation. Not a  single political figure from Leningrad or Petersburg fared well  after moving to Moscow. Most often their life ended prematurely  and violently.    A. Udaltsov: How, in your opinion, did a change of  course take place in connection with Gaydar's departure? Was  this course correct?    A. Sobchak: In principle, Gaydar's course was  absolutely correct. There is real proof of this. I will not  compare our economy with the Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any  other. Today we have already reached the point where the Russian  ruble is no longer termed "wooden." While other republics  consider their currencies "wooden" in relation to the Russian  ruble. I realize that 100 percent foreign currency  convertibility, at least in relation to these "semi-currencies,"  coupons, and such, is small consolation, but still. When I went  with the president to sign an agreement with Georgia, it was as  if we had returned to the end of 1991, except even worse: The  same distribution of basic foodstuffs by coupon, bread lines,  empty store counters... Returning to St. Petersburg, I  deliberately asked many people: Would you like to go back to  that today? Yes, many people are unhappy about prices. But would  you like to go back to December 1991, when there was a shortage  of everything? Everything except lines? I am convinced that not  a single person in Russia now, now that we have experienced  store saturation, is dreaming about the past, unless he is  playing political games.    The reform course had been chosen correctly. It was  impossible to make it without certain elements of shock therapy.  But from the very beginning a mistake, typical for Russia, was  made. While implementing the reform it was necessary to make  realistic adjustments to it. The idealistic straightforwardness  in the implementation of the reform was obvious.    In St. Petersburg our radical democrats accused me of  conservatism, shouting that I was shielding the nomenklatura.  All because I kept as advisers in the mayoralty many people from  the old nomenklatura who know how to work. I also advised  Gaydar: Have as advisers people who know the national economy.  The kind you can wake up in the middle of the might to tell you  what a plant in Nizhniy Tagil makes, what is produced in  Sverdlovsk and Petersburg, or where production of some or other  item can be set up. They are not being utilized today in any  way, but they have tremendous experience.    Yuriy Shchekochikhin, member of the editorial  board: I am interested to learn about the chief of the  Baltic Steam Line, Kharchenko. He was arrested for taking  bribes. Then he was let go. I know that considerable pressure  was brought on this "case." There was a letter of support from  Rostropovich, although I do not think they are acquainted. I  know that you, too, spoke in defense of Kharchenko. I think this  is not quite proper for a city mayor. It resembles the old party  obkom [oblast committee].    I am generally uncomfortable about a class approach to  corruption. If he is one of ours, he can do anything...    A. Sobchak: I think the entire definition of the  corruption issue is completely incorrect. I remember all those  conferences on corruption, Rutskoy's appointment as the man in  charge of combating this evil--before those 11 suitcases  surfaced. And mutual accusations? All this creates an absolutely  abnormal, distorted atmosphere of public life. It fogs the  environment, and then those who truly are corrupt, who take  bribes, remain in its shadows. While such people as Rutskoy and  Shumeyko slug it out. By the way, I am convinced that neither  one nor the other is corrupt. They, of all people, did not take  bribes. Meanwhile, the ordinary citizen, a Philistine, gets the  impression that they are all from the same lot.    Corruption is the main topic played up by the  counter-reformers, those who are fighting against democracy in  Russia. Their goal is to destroy confidence in the new authority.    This situation seems absolutely abnormal to me. Wherever we  are dealing with crime and corruption we have to have concrete  facts. Instead, people are pushed out of politics by talk and  rumors.    Now about Kharchenko. I took a very definite position on  this  matter because from the very beginning it acquired political  overtones. There were attempts to use it against the city  mayoralty and against me personally. I know that it was  organized at the directive of Moscow, because they needed an  example. This case came up right after the conference in the  Kremlin on combating corruption and crime. Comrade Rutskoy  proposed: Let us stop the idle talk; organize a few cases so  that people can see who steals and how. And suddenly, without  rhyme or reason, proceedings are initiated, and a man is  arrested right on the train. Why is it that all the repressions  in Stalin's time started in Leningrad? It is the most convenient  place to attract attention and give an example of what to combat  and how. I believe, however, that when a criminal case gets  political overtones, I, as the mayor of the city, as a political  figure, as a citizen, and as a jurist, have an obligation to  speak up. And not only with respect to Kharchenko. As to his  particular case, we will wait and see. Let us see how this case  ends and what kind of charges are brought. There are no bribes  involved there. He has nothing to do with corruption. For my  part this is not a class approach--it is the position of the  mayor of the city in which the chairman of the Union of  Entrepreneurs and State Enterprise Directors is arrested.  Economic managers turn to me: Why are we again being arrested,  grabbed in the street? Also, a taste has suddenly developed for  arresting... academicians. It is dangerous to fight gangsters.  An academician, on the other hand, especially on an economic  matter, on charges that he has allegedly set up an illegal  structure, may be taken right on the street, by people  brandishing submachine guns and pretending that they are  fighting mature criminals.    Unfortunately, today all talk of corruption is  phrase-mongering. I am telling you as a jurist. Until I see in  the Russian Criminal Code the words that corruption is a crime  consisting of such and such, as a jurist and a citizen I do not  want to discuss this evil altogether.    Yu. Kulikov, deputy editor in chief: In September  of last year, when Edict No. 1400 came out, could you foresee  the consequences it would lead to? After the events of that fall  the situation in the country, in my opinion, remained as  unsettled as before, if not worse. So was it worth it, as they  say, to start the scuffle?    A. Sobchak: Such a method of resolving a political  situation is altogether unacceptable. They could have, and  should have, done it without tanks shelling the parliament  building. Thus avoiding national shame. Of course, when you do  not know how to play chess, and the opponent starts winning, you  can take the chess board and slam him on the head with it. This  is the same: They could not win the game, so they slammed the  opponent on the head.    I was not the one to make this decision, however. The  Presidential Council is a consultative body. At its meetings we  only express our opinion, and the president has the right to  follow it or disregard it.    I want to emphasize, however, that when it got to the point  of armed rebellion, which is precisely what was happening in  Moscow, I did not have any doubt that force had to be used to  suppress the rebellion. Therefore, on my own initiative, I sent  two OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] regiments to  Moscow, leaving my city practically exposed. Since approximately  1600 on 3 October it was clear to me that this was a matter of  life or death. And of the future of the country. I gathered my  staff together; we discussed what was going to happen and what  we have to do if power in Moscow fell into the hands of the  rebels. I believed then and believe now that one has to fight  for his ideas rather than wait to be hanged on the first  available lamppost.    Yu. Solomonov, deputy editor in chief: If fascists  come to power in Russia, St. Petersburg can, of course, secede.  But do you not think that lumpenization of the population in the  city on the Neva is proceeding even faster than in Moscow? I  mean the numerous pro-fascist publications there, the mood, and  most importantly, movements and organizations of this bent.    A. Sobchak: Thank goodness, over the past three  years our city has not experienced the same kind of political  battles as other places. I consider it one of our main  achievements--the city lives a calm political life. We do not  prohibit anyone from holding rallies or demonstrations. And they  take place in a somewhat different key in our city...    Now about how we are fighting the spread of pro-fascist  attitudes. First and foremost, we are trying to restore  Petersburg as a spiritual and cultural center of Russia. Much  has already been done. For instance, not a single theater has  closed down. On the contrary, many new ones have opened. We try  to have cultural events take place in the city each day; we want  to turn it into a center of international festivals, meetings,  seminars. In addition to everything else, it may become one of  the distinguishing features of the city and one of the main  sources of revenue. Today I am doing everything to ensure that  no more plants are built in Petersburg. We are trying to move  production facilities away from the center, especially hazardous  ones. I think that most military-industrial complex enterprises  will die out. First and foremost because there are no people in  Petersburg today who would wish to do such hard unskilled work.  Take the Kirov Tractor Plant, where in the past a man--as a rule  covered with tattoos and rippling muscles--sat there and  tightened nuts on Kirovets wheels. Where did such a guy come  from? The general director would come to the obkom and say: I  need a residence permit for 5,000 "nut-tighteners." The  Leningrad Chief Construction Administration also brought in  about 20,000 construction workers a year, who were housed in  dormitories. This is where Zhirinovskiy's supporters come from.  They are well aware of this in Moscow. In place of the defense  sector, dozens of enterprises should arise, which will produce  all sorts of products for people. This is our future. By the  way, there are no factories in Paris...    I think it is in our common interest not to let the country  become the Russia of Zhirinovskiy. And this should not happen.  Such provincial fascism, a provincial political snow job at an  unbelievably primitive level... Russia will not allow it to  happen.    Yu. Solomonov: Germany also thought highly of  itself.    A. Sobchak: Still, history does not repeat itself.  People do learn from the mistakes of others or from tragedies of  the entire humanity. Therefore, what could happen in Germany at  the end of the 1920's-beginning of the 1930's cannot be repeated  in Russia at the end of the 1990's and beginning of the next  century.    Yu. Solomonov: All this is interesting to listen  to. We have to get rid of hazardous production. But is there not  an attempt at a certain social selection in all this? Your  colleague Yuriy Luzhkov put restrictions on the entry into  Moscow of persons of Caucasian ethnic origin. You put  restrictions on "nut-tighteners." This is not the way to improve  the quality of society and not the way to fight crime. You can,  of course, create "oases." But this milieu will exist somewhere  else and will coagulate into seats of social tension. At the  101st kilometer, perhaps?    A. Sobchak: Do not interpret me in such a  primitive way. We say that the city's profile needs to be  changed--not that Kirov plant workers should be thrown out on  the street. They must start doing other things. It is a job for  a robot to tighten nuts. A worker must move to another job that  will have more content, spirit, will transform him.    A. Sabov, commentator: You said that there are no  factories in Paris. There are factories in Paris. In Rome,  however, there is only one plant--it makes gas lighters. Rome is  completely a city of intelligentsia. But it is also a city of  strong right-wing traditions. The fascist electorate there is  very great. Therefore, ridding the city of proletarians does not  insure it against fascism. How many people in your city live  below the poverty line? As city mayor, what do you do above what  the central authorities do?    A. Sobchak: I would like to get rid right away of  such a formula as "getting rid of workers, of the proletariat."  We do not intend to get rid of anyone. I repeat once again: The  meaning of the program is to give these people different jobs.  So that they may do other things in the city. In particular, in  Paris, too, the Reno plant is not in the center of the city. As  for people living below the poverty level... This is one of the  main problems and difficulties of transition from one system to  another, building a principally new economy. The state may  succeed only if during the transition period it provides a  proper standard of living for the people and proper social  programs.    Journalists reproached Luzhkov for not wanting to let people  from the Caucasus come to Moscow. But this is not Luzhkov's  problem--it is a problem of a state that does not have borders.  When Russia sets up its borders and begins letting into Russia  only those it wants to let in on business or as tourists, then  it will be a different matter...    Until Russia has borders, it will be very difficult to fight  crime.    Now about social protection. Our city is special. Even  Moscow  cannot be compared with it. One and a half million out of 5  million of our population are pensioners, disabled, and  survivors of the blockade. These are the people who have found  themselves practically below the poverty level. And we were the  first in Russia who had to introduce allowances for them,  spending almost half the budget on it. Every quarter we  determine the subsistence minimum. And make up the difference to  those whose salaries or pensions are below that minimum. Of  course, because of this we build less housing, or do less of  some other things. But when I speak to the citizens of the city,  I always say that I cannot do otherwise. If you believe that  this is wrong--please, you have this right, collect enough votes  and recall me. As long as I am the mayor of the city, I cannot  stop caring for these million and a half people.    Thanks to some social measures, the city remains stable. Our  bread prices are still much lower than those in Moscow. Perhaps  this is the reason Zhirinovskiy came in only fourth in our city.  And the democrats as a whole took 65 percent of the vote.    D. Molchanov, commentator: You have said the word  "enemies" several times. This is a very strange trend. Do you  not believe that the authorities today deliberately are building  up the image of an enemy? And do you not think that this is  happening because, as experience shows, this authority can only  operate effectively in extreme situations?    A. Sobchak: I do not think so. The authority is  not creating the image of an enemy. It is simply that during the  transition period there are people who do not accept this  authority and are ready to fight it--not by political methods  but with arms. Which they have said many times. The same  Zhirinovskiy is already threatening to put many in "Sailor's  Rest." This is all much more serious than you think. For  instance, a few days ago in Petersburg a whole underground  munitions plant was liquidated. There are also armed groups  pursuing specific goals. By the way, we have already seen this  in the example of 3-4 October. This is not the image of an  enemy--these are real enemies. Perhaps those who take up arms  are not strictly speaking enemies, just confused people. But  those who are behind them are real enemies of Russia going the  way of democratization, of Russia becoming a democratic instead  of militaristic state, a state that works for its citizens. You  are mistaken if you think that someone is creating this image.    Here is the reality--in Petersburg as late as 1989, 76  percent of the economy was working for defense. This set the  stage for a real confrontation of interests. People who are  fighting to preserve this status are enemies of our society. We  should not be afraid of this word. If they really come to power,  they will shoot, root out all elements of democratic life.  Because they do not need it; it is against their interests.  Therefore we should say these things straight. The Moscow events  in October showed that the irreconcilable opposition has  well-armed, organized structures. And arms, and money, and  trained people. You cannot dismiss this.    And I cannot agree with you that the authority is effective  only in extreme situations. Had that been the case, today we  would be like Georgia. We do live somewhat differently.    A. Rubinov, commentator: As is known, you have  already been president... of the Consumers Union! So how can you  allow the offensive against the consumer to come from Leningrad  of all places. Your city, for instance, was the first to raise  public transportation rates. And yesterday there was a report  that in your city one has to pay now to get information on the  train schedule. The whole perestroyka started with charging for  the use of public restrooms.    A. Sobchak: In Norway it costs a dollar to use a  public restroom. The minimum wage there is $2,500, however...    Anatoliy Zakharovich, as a former president I will say this  to you, the former vice president of the Consumer Union. First,  your information regarding Leningrad introducing this is  somewhat incorrect. We always watch to make sure that our prices  are not higher than those in Moscow. In our city, for instance,  those who use public transportation pay only 14 percent of the  real cost of the ride. The real cost of a subway ride in  Petersburg today is R210. But the passenger pays only 14 percent.    A. Rubinov: Are there examples in the world where  public transportation is self-sustaining?    A. Sobchak: Everywhere.    A. Rubinov: Nowhere! Nowhere in the world!    A. Sobchak: Everywhere. Because the cost of using  public transportation in all developed countries is extremely  high. One subway ride in Norway costs $7... Now, about fees for  information. A journalist's ear is built somewhat differently  than that of other people. This information was reported this  morning. I heard it. This is what it said: We have learned that  the October Railroad administration is considering introducing  fees for information beginning next month... But you should know  that the Leningrad Station in Moscow also belongs to the October  Railroad. Therefore, if this is introduced, it will be in effect  not only in Petersburg but also in Moscow. As mayor, I will try  to interfere. To which the railroad chief will tell me: I plan  to make R200 million a year on this. I will tell him: All right,  I will pay you this R200 million, but do not disgrace our city  in front of the rest of Russia. That is all. But I cannot order  him.    A. Rubinov: If the MPS [Ministry of Railroads]  begins to charge for information, it will be more profitable for  it to keep changing the schedule than to stick to it. This way  the MPS will show a wonderful bottom line, while the trains will  be late even more often.    G. Tsitrinyak, commentator: A purely practical  question. The last time I saw ground attendants was about 15  years ago in the Maksim Trilogy movies. They were dispersing a  demonstration there. How is the situation with ground attendants  now?    And the second question. Do you not believe that people who  get maimed on city streets should get compensation from the city  treasury?    A. Sobchak: The second question is easy to answer.  We have legislation which assigns each city street to housing  offices and enterprises, which are legal entities. Therefore,  there is always someone to sue. The important part is to prove  that the accident was a result of appropriate measures not being  taken, or violation of existing regulations. Then the court will  award you compensation for damages. I happen to be a specialist  in this area. In almost all cases, those who turn to the court  get compensation for traumas received on the street.    Regarding grounds attendants. We have lost them, and normal  care of buildings along with them. Generally speaking, we will  have to do a lot to get things in order. For instance, the  mayoralty has appropriated R100 million to put lights in all  arch passageways in the center of the city. We have practically  completed this work. We are also restoring the position of  grounds attendant. Although this is a very costly undertaking.  It will cost the city budget about R10-15 billion.    Yu. Kulikov: In your future book, which  LITERATURNAYA GAZETA recently referred to, you maintain that the  LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and its leader are a  creation of the KGB and the CPSU Central Committee. However,  Gorbachev immediately refuted your statement...    A. Sobchak: Yes, I am writing a book "There Once  Was a Communist Party..." It will contain quite a few  little-known facts and details. In particular, this story.  Mikhail Sergeyevich says that Sobchak was not present at that  particular Politburo meeting, and that it did not adopt a  decision regarding the LDPR. But this is not what I am saying.  An opinion, as they say, was floated, an idea--to take the  process of formation of a multiparty system under control. And  the first party that was officially registered after Article 6  had been repealed was the liberal democrats. It was organized  quite quickly, efficiently, and yes, with the participation of  these organs. When I publish this book, it will tell all of this  in detail; I will quote documents, materials, persons. Because I  realize that if I do so without substantiation, I will be facing  lawsuits.    A. Udaltsov: Of course, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA also  took part in preparing society for democratic changes. But then  we saw how much blood was spilled. In Tbilisi, Vilnius, the  Dniester Area, Tajikistan, Karabakh. Was there a different way  to democracy--bloodless? And do you have any new viewpoint on  those events in Tbilisi?    A. Sobchak: The first question, I think, belongs  to the realm of scholastic reasoning. Life, politics, consists  of realities. If we study the real experience of other countries  we can see that a different transition was possible. With less  blood, fewer losses. But let us recall how the transition from a  totalitarian regime to democracy was carried out in postwar  Germany or Japan. They lived in an occupation regime. The  disciplined Germans, those who had been members of the Nazi  party, were simply ordered to join parties of a liberal and  Christian democratic orientation. They did so. In the final  analysis it was all accomplished without bloodshed.    I am not sure that without an occupation regime there they  would have managed without bloodshed. But if there are no  renewal processes in society, it will simply perish. If Genscher  thinks he destroyed communism, it is because he wants to think  this of himself. The communist system destroyed itself. It was  not the democrats who overthrew this regime in 1991. Because if  you read what we were writing and saying as late as the summer  of 1991, you will see that our plans assumed many years of  existence of the Communist Party. But it all collapsed, and not  because of some CIA intrigues or Genscher's activities--it  imploded. Because it could no longer exist. That is all there is.    About the Tbilisi events. I recently met with Boris  Nikolskiy, a former secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia  Central Committee. He is still convinced that the main mistake  was that the action was not tough enough. Had it been tougher,  more decisive, everything would be in order. This is a  tremendous delusion! And the impotence of the authority.  Patiashvili and other Georgian leaders instinctively felt their  impotence. All the rayon and lower level party committees  apparently function, but then suddenly some people appear out of  nowhere, gather a rally, and people follow them. The authorities  can do nothing about it.    This impotence of the authorities begets fear. And fear  begets an inclination toward violent solutions. Had the massacre  not taken place in Tbilisi on 9 April, I am convinced that we  would not have this provincial fascism Gamsakhurdia brought with  him (it is Georgians themselves who found this very precise  description of this regime). There would be no Gamsakhurdia. On  the wave of that massacre, however, he grew into a political  figure of major proportions and managed to convince the entire  nation over a very short period of time that they do not live  well because Russia is squeezing all the life juices from them.  Georgia has everything, he said. As soon as we close the border  with Russia, separate ourselves from it, the nation will recover  and live well. Only a man who is absolutely sick or completely  ignorant in economics could say that. He was both--sick and  ignorant. And he still convinced the people that Georgia would  survive without Russian oil, gas, grain, and many Russian  things. But the fact is that many republics had been subsidized  by Russia. Just like in Russia many autonomies are subsidized by  Petersburg and Moscow, Tyumen, and about 10 other regions. What  is happening is that the excess emotions to which people are  prone are being played on. We have been conditioned by all our  history to create idols for ourselves. This is where our  serfdom, slavery, manifests itself. We cannot do without idols.  Both Georgians, and we, Russians. When we become a civil  society, it will live without idols. It will not talk endlessly  about the president and chairman of the government. This should  be the last thing to interest people. And it is all because a  free man lives with less dependency on the state than we, unfree  people, live today.

headline:    Zyuganov on Russian Geopolitics--Part 1 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [First installment of two-part article by Gennadiy Zyuganov   under the heading "Essay in Russian Geopolitics": "Exploit of  Rus"]    [Text] The highest flights of majestic power and spiritual  purity have alternated in the history of our fatherland with  periods of state and political catastrophes and religious-moral  eclipses. Their deep-lying causes and roots are inaccessible to  an analysis within the framework of the customary approach and  require a serious and comprehensive philosophical  conceptualization. This field still awaits its thoughtful and  impartial researcher. At the same time, on the other hand, the  practical needs of the present day insistently demand a  determination of the pluses and minuses of Russia's present  position on the basis of the centuries-old majestic tradition.    So that we might, finally, stand with a "firm footing" on  the  native soil of the country's primordial national interests, it  is vitally necessary that we restore the natural historical  retrospective. And the formulation of such a most important  philosophical problem presupposes, in turn, the accomplishment  of the following tasks:    1. The formulation of a concept making it possible to reveal  and substantiate the "geopolitical invariants" of Russian  national interests, that is, the stable requirements pertaining  to the assurance of state security that guarantee us long-term  conditions of the country's peaceful and harmonious development.    2. The formulation of a procedure of the "ideological  correction" of our ailing society aimed at restoring the  historical continuity of Russian life in the national  self-consciousness, reviving the spiritual health of the people,  and ensuring the moral immunity of public opinion to relapses  into "foreign-mania."    3. Determination of a prospective model of Russia's social  and state development in the channel of its distinctive  traditions, spiritual reference points, and religious shrines.  <H5>  Two Approaches </H5>   A distinctive method making it possible to ascertain the  invariants of Russia's state interests is that of geopolitical  analysis. In terms of its content, geopolitics is a science  studying the normalities of the influence of geographical  factors on the role of states in world history and the formation  of political trends and the national-state interests of various  peoples and countries.    The basic propositions of this science were formulated back  at the end of the last century by the British political  scientist Halford Mackinder (1861-1947), whose studies formed  the basis of all subsequent geopolitical models of world  history. The term "geopolitics" itself, however, was first put  to use by the Swedish expert Rudolf Kjellen and immediately  taken up in Germany by Karl Haushofer, who became a most  important authority in this field.    A most important postulate of geopolitics is the assertion  that for formulation of the optimum strategy of state  development paramount significance should be attached not to  political or ideological predilections--short-term and rapidly  changing--but to stable factors of a country's  spatial-geographical position. Geopolitics attributes to such  primarily a state's location (continental, insular, or  littoral), the size of its territory, the prevailing type of  communications (sea or land), the predominant landscapes, and  similar parameters.    All the remaining aspects of state life, be they  commercial-economic or political-ideological, are deemed from  this viewpoint to be factors which are, although important,  nonetheless subordinate. It is believed here that it is the  permanency of the main "support characteristics" chosen as the  reference point that enable geopolitics to formulate with the  maximum efficiency the strategy of state development--be it in  the sphere of its foreign policy or defense.    In most general form the essence of geopolitical doctrine  may  be characterized by the following most important propositions:    Throughout human history two alternative, continuously  contending approaches to the conquest of the earth's surface  have formed the basis of constitutional development. They  may be designated the continental, land-expansionist, approach  characteristic of continental states and the "nautical" approach  basing the economic prosperity and state power of the metropolis  on the exploitation of overseas territories, which makes  domination on water lines of communication of fundamental  importance.    In recent European history the basic principles of  geopolitics are convincingly illustrated by the opposition of  the "ruler of the seas" of the British Empire to the states of  continental Europe that developed in the 16th-19th centuries  into a whole series of almost continuous wars and clashes both  in the European region and in the enemies' continental  possessions. America, which in the 20th century became Great  Britain's geopolitical successor, but no longer on a regional  but on a global, world scale, naturally inherited all the  fundamental features of this path of development. Throughout the  last century the scientific-technological revolution has  contributed and continues to contribute a number of essential  correctives connected with the modernization of the means of  information and communication, but there have nonetheless been  no fundamental changes here as yet.    Speaking in this connection of the molding of cultural and  world-outlook values, it should be stipulated that the complex  and mysterious sphere of the spiritual and religious-moral  development of the peoples cannot be adequately described in  terms of geopolitics concentrating their main attention on  outward, state-political forms of societal existence. But it can  be seen distinctly here that liberal-democratic ideology with  its cult of individualism and personal success serving the  commercial-economic mechanism of the "market" plunder of  continental sources of raw material and manpower becomes a most  important pillar of the trading "nautical" civilization. At the  same time, however, the traditional world outlook, with its  powerful communal roots presupposing the priority of solidary,  collective, conciliary forms of societal self-organization,  becomes the ideological foundation of "totalitarian" continental  culture and spirituality.    With reference to modern conditions what has been said above  signifies that the territories and regions lying on the  "continental periphery" of Eurasia and representing a connecting  link, as it were, between the inland expanses of the mainland  and the expanses of the oceans inevitably become an arena of  bitter and uncompromising opposition.    The "nautical" civilization endeavors to the utmost to  advance inside the mainland, turning the expanses which have  been won away from it into "forward-basing zones" and original  strong points for the defense of its global interests. In turn,  the representatives of the "continental" geopolitical tradition  have no choice but to make every effort to "throw into the sea"  their ocean adversary, having increased their own influence in  the littoral zone, creating in this way a barrier against his  expansion.    The United States expended colossal efforts to establish a  celebrated "arc of instability" on the external borders of the  USSR. Or we recall the well-known call of Zbigniew  Brzezinski--"to nibble at the Russian pie around the edges."  Truly something to think about.    In such a system the coordinate of the notorious "new  world order" appears to be nothing other than an attempt to  enshrine on a planetary scale the leading role of the "ocean  power" United States and its satellites by way of the power  imposition on the entire world community of the "liberal-market"  values of the trading nautical civilization.  <H5>  Elevation of the State </H5>   As a subject of geopolitics, the Russian state took shape  back in the ninth century as a result of the unification of  related East Slav tribes, the ancient cultural center of which  was the Middle Dnieper region headed by Kiev. Since the moment  of its formation Kievan Rus immediately became a most important  state of that era, and its statehood was of an unequivocally  continental nature. The basis of the material prosperity of  Kievan Rus determining to a considerable extent the burgeoning  of a very rich culture also was control over the inland mainland  expanses through which the celebrated trading route "from the  Varangians to the Greeks"--the most important communications  artery of Eurasia of those times--ran.    The development of Russian statehood was from the very  outset  filled with dramatic content, for that matter. A stern test  awaited the young state en route to prosperity: An insidious  steppe predator, the Khazar Khanate kept a jealous eye on its  strengthening rival. Their struggle, in the course of which it  sometimes appeared that the unenviable role of submissive vassal  had been prepared for Rus, until, finally, the valiant and  warlike Prince Svyatoslav smashed the khanate in the mid-10th  century, lasted several decades.    The first military encounters set a disturbing tone, as it  were, for all of subsequent Russian history. For 10 centuries  after this Russia had time after time--again and again--in  continuous rivalry with aggressive neighbors to prove its right  to distinctive existence, paying for this with the blood of its  best sons and daughters.    Just about the most fearful test on its historical path was  the Tatar-Mongol yoke. The immense empire of the Genghis  Khanites, which encompassed the entire mainland and stretched  from "the walls of immovable China" to the Baltic and from  Northern Siberia to Khorezm and Bukhara, was, by all accounts,  to have swallowed up as part of itself for good the "land of the  Rus" as a distant western province.    No one could have imagined that Rus, ravaged and  perishing in the turmoil of princely fratricidal strife, would  have taken over the baton from the empire of the Genghis  Khanites and at a price of incredible sacrificial efforts have  united within it the giant expanses of Eurasia, becoming forever  a guarantor and custodian of world geopolitical balance.    Nonetheless, this is precisely what happened.    Lost in the remoteness of impenetrable forests, the  downgraded hamlet of Moskova rose by the efforts of a long  succession of Russian princes--patient, consistent, and  single-minded builders of sovereign power--higher and higher,  becoming the visible center of all-Russian national-state unity.  It defended this role in the 14th-15th centuries by the  diplomatic skill of its rulers, the commercial aptitude of the  merchants, and the martial valor of the warriors, who fell in  countless numbers in 1380 on Kulikovo Field, paying the supreme  price for the independence of their country.    As a result of heroic efforts Russian statehood had acquired  a new quality by the mid-15th century under the scepter of Ioann  III.    Nonetheless, the true founder of the Russian geopolitical  state was Ioann the Terrible. First, he conquered the Kazan and  Astrakhan kingdoms--the last islets of the former Tatar-Mongol  might. Russia's second strategic breakthrough was the annexation  of Siberia. Altogether this process took several decades, its  decisive stage was the campaign of the Cossack chieftain Yermak  Timofeyevich, who was zealous for the security of the country's  eastern borders against the nomad raids.    The formidable tsar clearly understood the geopolitical  needs  of his state. It was no secret to him that the logic of Russia's  national-state interests insistently demanded control over the  maritime regions, and he began in the West an exhausting and  bloody war for the return of the country's sea boundaries--for  an outlet to the Baltic, which had come to be called the  Livonian Sea. For 12 years (1558-1583) Russia strained every  nerve in the struggle against four enemies--Poland, Sweden, the  Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Livonian Order. The cause  begun by Ioann was completed by another celebrated  sovereign--Peter I, the founder of the Russian Empire.    As distinct from the conventional opinion, in fighting  Sweden  (the strongest European power at that time) for the Baltic Peter  was not so much endeavoring "to carve out a window onto Europe"  as, on the contrary, to secure Russia against possible  aggression from the direction of the sea.    It was these same geopolitical considerations that dictated  many other famous undertakings of Peter--the building of the  navy, the decision to erect a new capital "on the shore of the  desert waves," and the close attention to European engineering  and military innovations. When the Northern War with Sweden  ended in 1721 with the Peace of Nystad (which annexed Ingria,  Estonia, and Livonia to Russia), this signified not only the  return of primordial Russian lands but a triumph of geopolitical  single-mindedness which ensured a regime of the maximum possible  tranquillity and peace for the population of the region,  incidentally, for the next 200 years (until the advent of those  who loved "to rectify injustice").    All of Russia's subsequent steps aimed at the discovery of  its natural geopolitical borders were dictated by its aspiration  to sovereign-state peacemaking. The closest confirmation of this  is the history of the annexation to Russia of the Crimean  peninsula. As of the 15th century the Crimean Khanate, the last  fragment of the once mighty Golden Horde, having consolidated  its position in Crimea and having become a vassal of the Turkish  sultan, became a pirate's nest regularly sending out its hordes,  which laid waste to everything around and reached the walls of  Moscow in their raids.    Russian troops attempted repeatedly to put an end to this  plunder, but their forces were insufficient, and the raids  continued. Finally, in the course of the 1768-1774 Russo-Turkish  War, in which Catherine II had been forced to act to secure the  country's southern strategic borders, Crimea was taken by  Potemkin's army. The center of aggression was suppressed, and  long-awaited peace was established on the vast expanses of the  Black Sea steppe, which lost, as a result of the Russian  Empire's single-minded pursuit of its geopolitical interests,  its border and "front-line" status.    A no less striking example of Russian peacemaking was its  decisive contribution to the victory over Napoleon. From the  viewpoint of the local European France-Britain opposition  Napoleon, with his "continental system," was undoubtedly the  main threat to the "nautical" geopolitical principle personified  by Great Britain. Nonetheless, on the scale of the immense  Eurasia this conflict was of a manifestly local, peripheral  nature, whereas Bonaparte's attempts to conquer Russia, having  disarticulated its giant expanses, contained a lethal threat to  the entire geopolitical balance of the mainland.    It is interesting that even so decidedly an anti-Russian  politician as Henry Kissinger was recently forced to acknowledge  in the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE that "the tsarist and Soviet  empires twice saved the European countries' independence  inasmuch as without their contribution Napoleon and Hitler would  have gained the ascendancy." A compliment from a highly dubious  source, of course, but nonetheless....    Following the victory over Bonaparte, it was thanks to the  efforts of Alexander I (with the active role of the Austrian  Chancellor Metternich) that the Holy Alliance of continental  states of Europe--Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary--which  was one further attempt to establish stability and security in  the European part of the continent--was concluded. The  persevering attempts--completed by Nicholas I--to secure Russian  control over the strategically important region of the Caucasus  lay in this same direction.    The Caucasus War of 1817-1864, which ended with the  annexation to Russia of Chechnya, Highland Dagestan, and the  Northwest Caucasus, was not at all (like other Russian wars  also) an act of conquest or aggression. Following the voluntary  incorporation as part of Russia of the Kingdom of Georgia  (1801-1810) and Azerbaijan (1803-1813), the Northwest Caucasus  had become a springboard for Turkish and Iranian expansion in  the region engendering endless military conflicts and bringing  devastation to entire provinces, and grief and death to hundreds  of thousands of peaceful inhabitants.    This state of affairs was actively supported by Britain, for  which the strengthening of the continental power of Russia  contained a great threat. The results of the annexation of the  Caucasus may be judged if only by the fact that the endless  bloody wars that had been lacerating this region almost  continuously from century to century came to an end for a long  time under the Russian scepter. And now in our post-perestroyka  times, when the defenders of the fatherland are abandoning the  "independent states," blood is being shed in Chechnya and  Ingushetia, Ossetia, Abkhazia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan!  Does history never teach us anything?    Generally speaking, the leading politicians of Russia  understood full well that the empire's Eurasian interests could  not be secured exclusively by military power and always put the  emphasis on peaceful influence in regions where its vital  interests were concentrated. This, incidentally, makes for the  unique multinational nature of Russia, which has for many  centuries accepted as brothers all the peoples that have  reunited with it.    It seemed that this growing continental might of Russia had  become eternal and invincible. Nonetheless, the evidence to the  contrary, the 20th century has been for our country a period of  devastating social cataclysms, bloody wars, and geopolitical  catastrophes.    In order to understand why this became possible it is  essential to address the spiritual and world-outlook processes  that determined the inner strength of the Russian State.

text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Second installment of two-part article by Gennadiy Zyuganov   under the heading "Essay in Russian Geopolitics": "Exploit of  Rus"]    [Text]  <H5>  `Heavenly' Soul </H5>   Geopolitics suggests how to maintain in a healthy and viable  state the sovereign body of the country and how to harmonize and  bring into line with objective requirements the external sphere  of the vital activity of a great people. But there inevitably  remains outside of the framework of this approach the immense  and fundamentally important inner sphere of spiritual, cultural,  and religious-moral national existence.    For Russia, though, this sphere has traditionally  performed an outstanding, if not to say determining, role. The  thousand years of our history unambiguously confirm that we are  an idealist-people, a dreamer-people, an ascetic-people  frequently guided in our practical activity not by the arguments  or reason and considerations of advantage or sober calculation  but by sincere urges of incredible force. It is they that  at times elevate Russia to the pinnacles of almost unattainable  selflessness, sacrifice, heroism, and sanctity, it is they, on  the other hand, that cast it at times into the abyss of nihilism  and moral decline.    For many centuries the zealous custodian of national ideals  and shrines was the Russian Orthodox Church. It carefully made  sure that the boundless breadth of the Russian nature engender  holy ascetics and sovereign builders sooner and more often than  brilliant adventurers and insatiable power-seekers.    The very emergence of stable Russian statehood is connected  with a spiritual phenomenon--the baptism of Rus in 988. Having  already been in existence for roughly 150 years by this time,  the union of East Slav tribes, which had withstood the difficult  struggle against the khanate of Khazaria, represented  nonetheless a formation that was diffuse and infirm and  threatened by the minute to fall apart under the pressure of  intertribal contradictions and localistic tribal interests. And  only the adoption of Christianity, which united the  freedom-loving Polyane, Drevlyane, Krivichi, Vyatichi,  Radimichi, and others by a strong philosophical union of common  religious ideals, stabilized its state form, initiating also the  start of the formation of that unique ethnopolitical and  spiritual-ideological community that is known to the world as  the "Russian people."    Since this time each in the least bit significant period of  our history has inevitably coincided with stages of the  spiritual formation of Russia. The people's memory has carefully  preserved the visible symbols of this coincidence--the figures  of all-Russian spiritual mentors such as Sergiy Radonezhskiy or  Nil Sorskiy and sovereign Russian leaders like the  lord-and-master princes Aleksandr Nevskiy and Dmitriy Donskoy.  Saviors of the fatherland Minin and Pozharskiy, the legendary  Suvorov and the "White General" Skobelev, Marshal Zhukov, and  the present state-absolutist patriots, unreconciled to national  disgrace and the humiliation of the Russian State, to an equal  extent--whether they were aware of this or not--professed one  and the same geopolitical principles, whose ideological,  spiritual, and religious content were the ancient prophesies of  the Monk Filofey.    Russia came by this continuity, however, at a high,  immensely  high price. Beginning in the 18th century, which had been marked  by Peter's drastic, "shock" reforms, small cracks began to  appear in the state-philosophical monolith of Russia. The  point is that the "Russian idea" in its classical form does not  recognize state power as being of self-sufficing significance,  defining as its purpose merely the creation of the optimum  conditions for the achievement of justice and the moral ideals  of personal, family, and social justice. The entire  ideology of the "symphony of powers"--spiritual, moral-religious  and state, and secular--is based on this fundamental assertion.  But it was this "symphonic" principle that was disrupted by  Peter, who unambiguously made paramount the imperial, majestic  might of the country as the highest priority.    The two centuries that followed were a period of continuous  growth of the state might of Russia. But simultaneously with  this the internal contradictions in society, the spiritual state  of which ceased to be a paramount concern of the state, became  increasingly profound. A severe crisis of Russian national  self-awareness was the inevitable consequence. As a result, when  the discrepancy between the external sovereign greatness of the  enormous country and its internal ideological state passed the  critical level, Russia fell under the burden of its own  contradictions.  <H5>  End of Empire, Take Two </H5>   It seemed that the storm and calamities of revolution had  become an irreparable geopolitical catastrophe for the state  that had taken shape. Russia's continental nucleus became  disarticulated (the Far East Republic and the newly formed  states of Ukraine, Crimea, the Transcaucasus Republic, and the  Baltic countries, isolated from vitally important coastal  zones). The spiritual continuity of Russian life was brutally  and abruptly severed.    Nonetheless, the centuries-old sovereign-state inertia was  able to overcome the pathogenic energy of disintegration. In  spite of everything--the ideological Russophobia of the radical  party wing, the temptations of "world revolution," and the class  antagonisms that raged in the fire of the civil war--the country  restored its natural geopolitical shape incredibly quickly. The  people paid a fearful price for this, shouldering the horror of  punitive measures and starvation, devastation, the  all-hands-to-the-pump work at the industrial construction sites,  and the burdens of forced collectivization. But they believed in  the ideals of justice and human brotherhood. By their heroic  efforts the state rose again from the dead, in spite of  everything, before the eyes of an astonished world, rising up  like a phoenix from the ashes.    The main strategic problem for the long-term survival  of Russia arrayed in the new state body of the Soviet Union was  that of the discovery of a constructive world outlook and the  restoration of the spiritual life of the nation. It was in  this sphere that things were most difficult: The totalitarian  trends of state power had acquired an ugly, exaggerated form,  having become deadened in ideological tenets ruthlessly  suppressing the least spark of free, inquiring thought. This  situation, however, began to change rapidly in the years of the  Great Patriotic War, which became the pivotal moment of the  Soviet period of Russian history.    Without getting into assessments of the personality of  Stalin, it has to be acknowledged that he more than anyone else  understood the need for philosophical renewal within the  framework of the geopolitical form of the USSR. He also  understood the urgent need for the harmonization of the new  realities with age-old Russian tradition. The result of this  understanding was the abrupt change in the official ideology of  the Soviet Union in the period 1944-1953.    The basis of the new policy was the aspiration to  create an effective "ideology of patriotism" corresponding to  the demands of contemporaneity which could be a dependable  philosophical basis for the functioning of the state mechanisms  of the enormous Soviet state and its allies. Many pages of  authentic Russian history were restored and all persecution of  the church was emphatically terminated as the first order of  business to this end.    The USSR won the most dreadful and bloody war in the history  of mankind. Fully in accordance with its interests, it expanded  to the utmost the zones of influence in the sea and oceanic  directions, blocking henceforward any attempt at direct threats  to the borders of the state. The postwar devastation was  overcome and an autonomous, self-sufficient economic system  capable, given the competent domestic use of the country's  colossal natural wealth, of providing for the steady growth of  national well-being was created in record time. Were its pace to  have continued, the "ideological restructuring" left no doubt  that within 10-15 years the USSR would have fully overcome the  negative spiritual consequences of the revolutionary storms,  having developed their constructive results to the maximum here.  The creation of native nuclear weapons ruled out all  possibilities of power interference in our internal affairs.    Such prospects evoked in the West--the traditional citadel  of  "oceanic geopolitical strategy"--a state close to panic. There  were reasons for this. A most powerful alternative center  of world influence personifying justice and the power of the  people and the social, political, cultural, and economic  principles of the "continental" line of development of human  civilization was taking shape in the person of the USSR--the  continuer of the Russian geopolitical tradition. The  centuries-old efforts of the commercial and financial  cosmopolitan elite to create a "world system of the  international division of labor"--the economic basis for the  subsequent political standardization of mankind within the  framework of a "new world order"--were in jeopardy.    This dramatic global encounter of the two archetypes of  world  politics, economics, and culture was personified in the  opposition of the two superpowers--the United States and the  USSR--which acquired the forms of the cold war.    The anticommunist rhetoric of the "free world" and its  hypocritical concern for "human rights" here were the  ideological screen behind which the invariable age-old  geopolitical interests of the West demanding the weakening and,  if possible, the destruction of Russia were concealed from the  gaze of the uninitiated. This hypocrisy has become particularly  obvious now, when the unconcealed flouting of the rights of  millions of Russians and Russian speakers, who in the new  ethnocratic states of the CIS have found themselves in the  position of second-class citizens, not only is not evoking  condemnation but is being tacitly welcomed by the "civilized  world."    From the moment of the start of the cold war, when the  secret  mechanisms for the destruction of the Union were engaged,  through the final act of the drama in 1991, three stages--three  consecutive periods of the development of the geopolitical  sabotage against the USSR--may, conditionally, be distinguished.    The first began immediately following the death of Stalin  and  was conducted beneath the slogans of "de-Stalinization" and  "Khrushchev's 'thaw.'" History does not know the subjunctive  mood, alas: The some 57 years of life were not enough for Stalin  to have made his "ideological restructuring" irreversible and to  have ensured the restoration of the Russian spiritual-state  tradition, which had been unjustifiably interrupted. The  leader's body was not cold in the Mausoleum before his  successors were abruptly turning back the ideological course.  The "entire civilized world" clamorously welcomed this maneuver,  maintaining a modest silence about the labors it had cost its  politicians, diplomats, special services, and "agents of  influence."    The era of "stagnation" naturally continued this pernicious  process. Dogmatic teachings that were patently out of date were  preserved by the efforts of many of the present "outstanding"  democrats who were at that time implacable conformist types. The  absence of a healthy philosophical base was echoed in painful  confusion in the sphere of Soviet geopolitics also.    On the one hand geopolitically substantiated attempts to  expand the zone of Soviet influence in the strategic continental  directions--in Afghanistan, for example--assumed a categorically  impermissible radical-militarist nature. On the other, measures  like the attempt to "install" Nicaragua in the "world socialist  system," which were utterly pointless from the geopolitical  viewpoint, swallowed up giant forces and resources. Deprived of  an adjusted geopolitical concept, the USSR succumbed to the  temptation of a "symmetrical," "socialist" mondialist response  to the strategic challenge of capitalist mondialism on the part  of the United States.    Year after year this insupportable burden exhausted our  powers. Year after year we strained the resource and industrial  and military and demographic potential of the country in the  chase after mirages of global world leadership entirely alien to  the very spirit of the Russian geopolitical tradition. The  result was soon reflected: The economic situation within the  USSR began to deteriorate consistently, and the ideological,  religious, and cultural vacuum created unprecedentedly favorable  conditions for the infiltration in society of alien values,  destructive philosophies, and egotistically parasitical  stereotypes of social consciousness.    Such was the general situation when the "generational  change"  in the highest Kremlin echelons enabled Russia's enemies to  embark on the second stage of the dismantling of the USSR--the  creation of the ideological base for its collapse. Its  chronological framework encompasses 1985-1990--the bulk of  Gorbachev's "perestroyka."    I have in previous articles dwelt in sufficient detail on  the  specific mechanisms of the "slow-moving catastrophe" that  ensured the destruction of the USSR, so to avoid repeating  myself I would note merely that the main areas of the  ideological war against the Union were the avowed Russophobia of  the denationalized part of society, the incitement of  antipatriotic hysteria cleverly linked "in a package" with  furious anticommunism, and the deafening, importunate propaganda  of the "charms" of the liberal-democratic philosophy.    The third, culminating stage of the global geopolitical  sabotage took just two years (1990-1991) and was aimed at  political assurance of the disintegration of the single Union  state. In the domestic political sphere it was characterized as  a "struggle against reactionaries" in the directive machinery of  the party and government, an abrupt outburst of outlying-area  nationalism and regional separatism, the paralysis of the  central authorities, and use of the "democratic" Russian  leadership as a battering ram to destroy the general economic,  legal, political, and cultural space of the country.    Today, with the passage of two and a half years filled  with dramatic events that have been the natural consequences of  the collapse of the USSR, it may be maintained with confidence  that the backstage sponsors of this operation were, for all  that, unable to achieve all their strategic goals.    And the plan was this: By way of speeding economic and  political changes within the Soviet Union and the broad-based,  single-minded ideological indoctrination of the populace in a  "democratic" spirit, to cause in the disoriented society a loss  of natural immunity connected with intuitive healthy  conservatism and the self-preservation instinct. Having  suppressed the protective mechanisms of social self-awareness,  to ensure the collapse of the unified state against the  background of the buffoonish Emergency Committee "putsch." On  the wave of this powerful state-ideological cataclysm  accompanied by the most powerful shock to the mass consciousness  to occupy the key positions in all the leading spheres of social  life. To ensure the maximum possible degree of Russia's  economic, political, and military dependence on foreign  (Western) influence. And, most important, having availed  themselves of this, to trigger on a par with the ongoing chaos,  economic crisis, and shocked state of society the mechanisms of  internal Russian disintegration, taking as a basis the  separatism of the national outlying areas, regional  contradictions, and the fratricidal struggle of Moscow's  political clans.    The "architects of perestroyka" evidently had in mind a  broader timeframe for the realization of their far-reaching  operation. The studies of social psychologists and practical  experience show that the "period of shock" of the mass  consciousness which is caused by sudden social upheavals and  which "switches off" the mechanisms of social self-protection  cannot be long. In the case of Russia-USSR the engineers of the  collapse could have counted on four or five years, no more.    Taking as the initial reference point of the shock processes  on the territory of the USSR the year of 1989, when  "perestroyka" had entered its "revolutionary" phase, we see that  this timeframe is today at an end. Here are the true reasons for  the "surprise" results of the recent elections, this is the  cause of the growth of the "neoimperial" mood in society!    "The sleep of reason gives birth to monsters," the sharp and  shrewd Goya once said. Today the collective reason of our  people is beginning slowly and with difficulty to awake  following many years of an arduous and tormented half-conscious  state.  <H5>  Choice of Destiny </H5>   The charges against Russia of a "revival of Great-Russian  chauvinism" and the "pursuit of an imperial policy," which have  become fashionable as of late, reflect the increased agitation  of the world's backstage players aware that the entire global  decades-long anti-Russia and anti-Russian intrigues are now on  the verge of being thwarted. For it is obvious that, having  regained consciousness from the long semi-comatose state, having  recognized their true national-state interests, and reviving on  the basis of millennial historical traditional values, Russia  will not accept the humiliating role being imposed on it and  will restore its natural position of great world power.    So:    Today, as in past centuries, the vital interests of Russia  consist by no means of "subduing," "conquering," or  "subjugating" anyone. Not of endlessly expanding its territory,  which is the most vast in the world as it is. Not of straining  the people's efforts in vain attempts to impose on someone or  other its own view of the world as the "sole correct" and  uncontested view.    They consist primarily of gathering on its land, under  its own roof, under the protection of a single powerful state,  all Russian people, all who consider Russia their motherland,  all the peoples that agree to link their historical destiny with  it. And Moscow does not have the right to abandon this  traditional role of "gatherer of the lands"--and will not do so,  however much some people would like to "hound the Russian bear  in his den."    Further, our vital interests consist of ensuring in our own  home unconditional and lasting peace guaranteed against all  encroachments from outside and from within, the corresponding  foreign policy conditions having been created for this. Of  protecting our historical individuality and distinctive  spirituality against the aggression of alien, perverted  stereotypes of mass consciousness and against the noxious  influence of immorality elevated to a norm of life and  individualistic egotism extolled as a virtue. In order to create  for our fellow citizens all the necessary conditions for  education and health care, labor, and recreation, the  development of science and culture, and a happy childhood and  serene old age.    Russia is today experiencing a unique moment in his  existence. We have in the past century acquired invaluable  experience, by which we have come at an exorbitant,  irreplaceable, excruciating price. Are we unable to take  advantage of it; to consider the tragic lessons of the past,  multiply the heroic traditions of national history, and from the  height of the present dolorous days finally overcome the  internal disagreements, having restored the successive and  consistent current of our life?    Today, for the first time in three centuries, we have a real  opportunity to restore the symphonic unity of our spiritual and  state traditions. We are now all too well aware of how heavy the  yoke of aspiritual statehood can be, and sense all too well what  a fearful moral price would have to be paid for the loss of the  ideals that could impart to our conciliary, national, social  being sacred, eternal, and nontransient meaning....    But in order to realize all our actual potential we must  learn to take a sober view of things, without illusions or  embellishment. This means first and foremost that we must  recognize that far from everyone in the world around us will be  happy that Great Russia is reviving. Life's realities are  such that the age-old struggle of the two rival geopolitical  principles will not end merely because Russia's democrats have  suddenly become smitten with a tender love for the Western way  of life. And this being the case, let us recall, nonetheless,  that:    the state exponent and most complete spokesman for the  competing geopolitical model is the United States of America  superpower with its strategic allies constituting altogether the  geopolitical bloc that we are accustomed to designating by the  term the "West";    the economic exponent and industrial pillar of this model is  the commercial and financial cosmopolitan oligarchy straining  after world domination and constituting the main driving force  of the contemporary mondialist plan of the "new world order";    its philosophical exponent is liberal-democratic ideology,  whose basic features are extreme individualism, militant  aspirituality, religious indifference, a devotion to mass  culture, antitraditionalism, and the principle of the domination  of the quantitative over the qualitative principle....    There are, unfortunately, exponents of this geopolitical  principle within Russia also. A fifth column of politicians and  public figures and parties and organizations of a "pro-West"  persuasion united by a commitment to the "wild" market and the  unchecked "integration of Russia in a single world community"  and the unconditional priority of "values common to all mankind"  are appearing primarily in this unattractive role.    Let us say at once that the affirmation of these facts is  under no circumstances a call for confrontation and enmity. On  the contrary, a clear understanding of the situation only  increases the chances of a reasonable compromise and mutually  beneficial cooperation.    I would like in conclusion to emphasize once again the  thought that serves as the leitmotiv of the entire article: We  are today faced with a choice that will determine Russia's fate  for a long time to come. A choice that we should be helped to  make by our entire age-old history, our entire tragic and heroic  experience, and by all our incalculable and nameless compatriots  who from age to age created the great state and defended it  against encroachments and adversities.    We simply do not have the right to make a mistake in this  choice!

headline:    Federation Republic Leaders Profiled 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Vitaliy Portnikov under the rubric "Concepts and   People": "The Faces of Power or the Power of Faces in Russia:  Outlines of the Political Portraits of Leaders of the Russian  Republics"]    [Text] When in 1991 I completed my article "The Faces of  Power or the Power of Faces?" dedicated to then members of the  USSR Council of the Federation, I had occasion to devote a small  section, "Aspiring Figures," to leaders of the former Russian  autonomies. Three years have gone by and the "aspiring figures"  have turned into real, active politicians, often quite well  known, who are actively influencing the situation in the Russian  Federation. And so these new observations are devoted to  them--more or less an expanded version of my previous section,  but written in recent times when it is not so much the component  parts of the Russian Federation that are desirous of sovereignty  as much as Russia itself.  <H5>  AUSHEV </H5>   The very appearance of the president of Ingushetia on  Russia's political scene is akin to the emergence of his native  republic. Ingushetia has emerged, one might say, under extreme  conditions, following the proclamation of independence of the  Chechen Republic and the actual collapse of a united entity that  existed for many years--the Checheno-Ingush Republic, in which  the Ingush people occupied far from a dominating position.  Likely hoping for a return to the status quo, the federal  authorities were in no hurry to recognize the new republic and  contribute towards the structuring of its organs of power. In  the meantime, a territorial question lay at the center of  Ingushetia's political life--the fate of Prigorodnyy Rayon,  which found itself part of neighboring North Ossetia after the  deportation of the Ingush people. Nazran associated the return  of the territory in dispute with Moscow, a factor that was not  least important in leading to tragedy and an almost complete  loss of trust in the federal center and in Boris Yeltsin. Then  we see emerging in this catastrophic situation in  Nazran--General Ruslan Aushev, a veteran of the war in  Afghanistan and former Union people's deputy, appointed head of  the provisional administration in Ingushetia. Indeed, the  situation that had taken shape as of that moment in the republic  demanded a leader of precisely such "generalship." But Aushev  also showed himself to be a quick-witted politician. Resigning  from the position of head of administration, he distanced  himself from the center, which had lost its prestige, and was  viewed in the presidential elections as the undisputed national  leader. But this prestige has not diminished Ruslan Aushev's  difficulties. After all, he must construct virtually brick by  brick the power of a republic that until quite recently did not  exist, a republic with undetermined borders and a chaotic  political life. And he must do all this under conditions of a  state of emergency and unsettled conflict with Ossetia... At the  same time, Ruslan Aushev is managing to preserve a certain  loyalty from afar in his relations with President Boris Yeltsin  and the federal leadership. One example of this diplomacy of the  Ingushetian president is Boris Yeltsin's recent Caucasus trip  and Ruslan Aushev's handshakes with North Ossetian President  Akhsarbek Galazov.  <H5>  BIRYUKOV </H5>   Nikolay Biryukov, chairman of Mordvinia's Supreme Soviet,  has  managed to show quite convincingly that it is he who is the real  "boss" in the republic. Losing the presidential election in  December 1991 to the Democratic Russia nominee--engineer Vasiliy  Guslyannikov, the Supreme Soviet chairman did not content  himself with the role of "second fiddle." In confrontation with  President Guslyannikov, Nikolay Biryukov, an experienced party  functionary who attained the position of secretary of the  Mordvinian party obkom [oblast committee], has successfully  taken advantage of the mistakes of the young administration and  Guslyannikov's lack of understanding of the processes of  sovereignization in the Russian republics. The Mordvinian  president--of Russian nationality in addition, has become an  active ally of Moscow (and just about the only one) in the  struggle against the apparition of separatism. Perhaps it is  precisely the Mordvinian president's lack of a stance in favor  of independence that proved the decisive factor in the decision  of the republic Supreme Soviet to eliminate the position of  president in April of last year and elect a new government  headed by Valeriy Shvetsov: Authority and the initiative were  returned to Nikolay Biryukov. Despite the support the central  authority attempted to render Vasiliy Guslyannikov, the duality  of power was not long preserved. The Kremlin's gestures could be  perceived as lack of respect for the decisions of the republic  parliament, and the constitutional courts of Russia and  Mordvinia confirmed the legality of the Supreme Soviet  resolutions. Following the October events, President Yeltsin  appointed his own representative to Mordvinia. Nonetheless, even  under conditions of the triumph of the central authority,  Nikolay Biryukov's enemies failed to collect the necessary  number of votes to remove him from the post of Supreme Soviet  chairman. In addition, results of the Russian parliamentary  elections in Mordvinia registered a change in the mood of the  electorate: New Prime Minister Shvetsov and two members of the  Communist Party became deputies. And so, nothing now stands in  the way of Nikolay Biryukov--having shown what republic  independence means in practice--from joining with the group of  republic leaders most supportive of the concept of sovereignty.  <H5>  GALAZOV </H5>   Recently elected the president of North Ossetia, Akhsarbek  Galazov is one of the best well known leaders of the Caucasus.  This is due both to the geopolitical role of his little  republic, which finds itself in the middle of two intricate  territorial conflicts (Georgian-South Ossetian and North  Ossetian-Ingushetian), and to his own personal capabilities, as  became clear during the course of the presidential election  campaign. Indeed, the recent Supreme Soviet chairman has easily  managed to show that he is the number one leader in the  republic: Aleksandr Dzasokhov, one of the strongest aspirants to  the office of president, former member of the Politburo of the  CPSU Central Committee and first secretary of the North Ossetian  party obkom, withdrew his own candidacy, and Viktor Khetagurov,  chairman of the Council of Ministers of North Ossetia, was  defeated and forced to resign the post of prime minister. Two  experienced party and economic leaders fell by the wayside  before the former rector of North Ossetian University, who  served in the educational system almost his entire life--a  situation atypical overall of the republic elite. But over the  four years of his stay at the head of North Ossetia, Galazov has  been able to become not simply its leader, but a symbol of the  republic's rigid position in the territorial conflicts as well.  Appearing on the post-USSR political scene alongside Torez  Kulumbegov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of South Ossetia,  Galazov never concealed the support his republic has been  showing its warring brother on the other side of the border, and  the parliament of North Ossetia has even recognized the former  Georgian autonomy as an independent state. Akhsarbek Galazov  adopted an even more irreconcilable position during the  Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict. But it should be noted for the sake  of fairness that in both cases the interests of Vladikavkaz  coincided in part with those of Moscow, which in no way objected  to the weakening of Zviad Gamsakhurdia's Georgia and strove to  preserve the status quo in Russia's North Caucasus--violated by  Ingushetian territorial claims. Is this not wherein lies the  secret of Galazov's increased political influence upon the  Moscow leadership and Boris Yeltsin's standing in North Ossetia?  But now, having been elected president, Galazov faces a choice:  either continue to advance the hard line advocated in fact by  the voters or, leaning on the prestige he has already won, try  to settle the conflict with Ingushetia and pull the republic out  of the "front-line" state it has been in for several years now.  <H5>  DZHARIMOV </H5>   Adygea is the only one of the former autonomous oblasts  transformed into republics to decide on introduction of the  presidential form of government. Just the fact that Adygeys  comprise slightly under one-fourth of the population of the  republic testifies as to the complexity of the tasks to be  accomplished by Aslan Dzharimov in this office. The separation  of Adygea was received with a certain nervousness by the  leadership of Krasnodar Kray, which used to include the  autonomous oblast. Therefore, Dzharimov's role in alleviating  the situation that has come about can be compared with the  stabilizing role of the leaders of the new independent states  who graduated from the Moscow political school (the Adygea  president served many years in leading positions in the kray  center, and his informal relations with Krasnodar leaders  without any doubt helped in Adygea's "informal" withdrawal from  Krasnodar Kray): In addition to concluding an agreement with the  former "mini-mother country," the republic government introduced  the special position of chairman [as published] at the head of  administration of Krasnodar Kray, with the rank of minister.    President Dzharimov became well known to broad segments of  society after his sudden incursion into Caucasian geopolitics.  In the heat of the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict, the Adygey leader  offered intermediary proposals. Like other leaders of Russia's  Caucasian republics, however, the president of Adygea turned out  all the same to be a resolute supporter of the Abkhaz side. This  is explained not only by the ethnic proximity of Abkhazians and  Adygeys and the natural sympathy Maykop has for the Sukhumi  leadership--holding analogous status, albeit within another of  the former Union republics, but also by the influence in Adygea  of the Confederation of Peoples of the Caucasus, even though  such influence is far more limited here than in neighboring  Caucasian republics. Despite support for the concept of Adygey  national rebirth (specifically, the republic leadership has  assisted the Worldwide Cherkess Association, one of whose  congresses was convened in Maykop), Aslan Dzharimov is compelled  to proceed with special caution so as to avoid encroachment of  any kind upon the Russian community (although Maykop is  constantly accused of this by certain political circles in  Krasnodar) while simultaneously ensuring the power potential of  the "titular" people. Adygea's recent election of a new  parliament demonstrated the great complexity of this task.  Nonetheless, the republic remains one of the calmest regions of  the Caucasus.  <H5>  DUDAYEV </H5>   The Chechen president immediately stands out within the  overall list of leaders of the Russian republics in that he does  not consider his republic to be a part of the Russian  Federation. Thus, for long time now Chechnya has been existing  in a situation that has no analog in international law (or in  the practice of federative or confederative relations):  Considering itself an independent state, the republic appears in  the constitution of "a neighboring state" as a Federation  entity. All the same, the Moscow authorities, for example,  equate Chechens with foreigners, obliged to undergo registration  when they arrive in the capital. This inconvenience can also be  seen as a triumph for Dzhokhar Dudayev--one more in-fact  recognition of Chechen independence, and as an admission that  the federal authorities finally have to concur with the  separation of the Chechen-Ingush Republic, accomplished "from  below"--in Groznyy, and not "from above"--in Moscow. As well as  the fact that there is an ever dwindling number of politicians  in the general-president's entourage interested in finding any  real compromise with the center--as if in response to Boris  Yeltsin's recent speech in the Caucasus in which the Russian  president termed Chechnya the main factor of instability in the  region, once again ruling out any possibility of reaching some  kind of agreement with Groznyy.    It is possible that the secret of Dudayev's political  survivability also lies in the fact that his mannerisms are  often strikingly similar to Yeltsin's. The striving to achieve a  presidential republic, to concentrate all real power in the  hands of the presidential administration, easy parting with  those who were recently the closest comrades-in-arms and now the  source of irreconcilable conflict, the ability to collect  oneself brilliantly in an extreme situation but perform  illogical actions in "days of peace"--all these parallels are  familiar to observers in both Groznyy and Moscow. And indeed,  Dudayev became the leader of Chechnya during the violent  dissolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Chechen-Ingush Republic  following the August putsch, while it was precisely following  the August events that Yeltsin grew into a true state leader.  Yeltsin's struggle with the party machine assisted in his  formation as a political figure. The Dudayev phenomenon was  supported not only by the trend toward sovereignization of  Chechnya which was gathering force, but also by the sincere  desire of the victors of August in the Russian leadership to get  rid of "disobedient" republic leaders. A campaign of propaganda  was launched against an entire series of leaders (both Union and  republic leaders). Only the Zavgayev regime in Groznyy fell,  however, and Dudayev's appearance became a fitting illustration  of the results of this campaign. Moscow's continued struggle  with the Dudayev regime just about led to a tragic result and  facilitated the formation of the Chechen president as a  charismatic personality with no other alternative. It is likely  that under any other conditions the authoritarianism of Dudayev  would elicit rejection of the leader and even cause his  replacement, but in the extreme situation, the general's  opponents simply have nothing with which to oppose him.  Especially since not a single one of them is opposing the  concept itself of independence, and General Dudayev is seen as  the symbol of this concept. It is this "symbolic" aspect and a  special economic and political freedom that allow the president  of Chechnya to be a geopolitical figure of the Caucasus as well  (we need only recall the congress of the Confederation of  Peoples of the Caucasus in Groznyy, or Zviad Gamsakhurdia's long  stay in the Chechen capital).    All the same, however, it would be difficult to call  Dzhokhar  Dudayev's position stable, even if he succeeds in resolving his  internal problems. The positions of Russia and Chechnya relative  to one another are such that, sooner or later, they will have to  embark upon some path of compromise. Having already managed to  become the symbol of an unwavering, principled position, the  general will hardly be capable of being the bearer of such  compromise.  <H5>  ZOTIN </H5>   The president of the Republic of Mari El is one of the  "calmest" of the Volga leaders. Actively communicating with the  leaders of neighboring Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and  Udmurtia--well known as leaders of "the opposition" among the  republics, Valeriy Zotin nonetheless has maintained decent  relations with the federal authority. It is clearly no accident  that President Boris Yeltsin began his series of postelection  meetings with leaders of the Russian republics by conferring  with the presidents of Tatarstan and Mari El. Zotin's position  in this regard was brought about by the political and economic  situation in Mari El, where the mood in favor of  sovereignization is finding less support than in the other Volga  republics, due to a lesser concentration of indigenous  population and Yoshkar-Ola's economic dependence on grants from  Moscow--the republic cannot boast about stores of energy  resources in the manner which gives Kazan and Ufa the  opportunity to claim special rights. Thus, Mari El is trying to  use the sovereignization achievements of its neighbors primarily  in a symbolic way. Supreme Soviet Chairman Valeriy Zotin was one  of the first in the Russian republics in this position to be  elected president of the republic. Zotin was also sufficiently  careful during the constitutional crises, when many other  republic leaders hastened to announce their sympathies and  antipathies. But such caution is easily explainable by Valeriy  Zotin's previous activity, having spent many years in secondary  roles in the Komsomol and party apparatus. The flow of power  from the party to the soviets made him the head of the  republic--it did not take away the circumspectness he had  acquired.  <H5>  ILYUMZHINOV </H5>   Kirsan Ilyumzhinov is perhaps the most extravagant leader  among the republic presidents. Just the simple fact of election  of the 30-year-old businessman as head of Kalmykia demonstrates  the arrival of a new political era in the Russian Federation,  when representatives of groups not traditionally found in the  "corridors of power" are capable of taking advantage of  relatively free, multi-candidate elections (the success of  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party in the election to the Russian  State Duma simply confirms this hypothesis). Like Zhirinovskiy,  Ilyumzhinov is to a certain extent a puzzling figure. The  seeming "simplicity" of his biography in no way explains the  emergence of the Ilyumzhinov phenomenon--neither in business nor  in politics. Ilyumzhinov's preelection promises constitute a  classic example of a populist program--unrealizable if only  because of its grandiose nature and always victorious for the  same reasons, and his political activity following the election  has been an odd mixture of establishment of an authoritarian  regime in his own republic with support for soviet  parliamentarianism on the federal level. Ilyumzhinov dissolves  the Supreme Soviet of Kalmykia, eliminates the multiparty system  and the republic Ministry of Security at the same time, suspends  the federal program of privatization in Kalmykia... Having  previously told journalists that Yeltsin agreed to view the  republic as a "political testing ground" at a meeting with him,  the president of Kalmykia then--during the days of  October--turns out to be the most energetic supporter of the  Congress eliminated by the Russian president. It is through his  efforts that the "alternative Council of the Federation," of  opposition regional leaders, is being instituted. It is  Ilyumzhinov who issued statements most critical of Boris  Yeltsin--including in the blockaded White House, and who called  Yeltsin "the former president." Nonetheless this position held  by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov has not swayed his standing in Kalmykia,  judging from the results of the election to the upper chamber of  Russia's Federal Assembly. Moscow has not yet developed  effective mechanisms for toppling republic leaders who are  objectionable to the center. Subject to far more heated debate  than President Ilyumzhinov's current standing is the problem of  the real results of his economic policy--capable either of  bringing about a change of authority in the republic or of  making the Kalmyk leader far more loyal in his relations with  the center.  <H5>  KOKOV </H5>   The president of Kabardino-Balkaria must be referred to as a  leader who has proven both his independence from Moscow and his  ties with the center--which are even stronger than those of most  of his republic president colleagues. Displaced from his  position as chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria following the August (1991) events, Valeriy  Kokov nonetheless easily reacquired power in just a few months,  sustaining victory in the presidential election. Kokov's solid  position within the power elite is entirely expected and stems  from his previous party career, terminating in the position of  first secretary of the CPSU republic committee. The president's  position and prestige among leaders of the new national  movements are far less solid. Valeriy Kokov had to play the role  of arbiter, fighting for the concept of a united  Kabardino-Balkaria to counter supporters of a Republic of  Kabarda and Republic of Balkaria. He has hardly been able to  successfully manage this role, however. In any event, a mass  meeting of the Congress of the Kabardin People in the autumn of  1992 almost ended in the president's resignation. It was only  energetic support from Moscow (which probably learned a lesson  as a result of the overthrow of Doku Zavgayev, chairman of the  Supreme Soviet of the Chechen-Ingush Republic, and did not  desire to repeat the Groznyy scenario in Nalchik) that helped  Valeriy Kokov retain his position. To complete the picture one  must recall that one of the main opponents of the president  during those days was Yuriy Kalmykov--then president of the  Congress of the Kabardin People and now federal minister of  justice.    The unstable position of the president of the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria is probably related to a lesser degree to  personality, and to a greater degree to the very vulnerability  of the institution of head of a "dual" republic. After the  collapse of Checheno-Ingushetia, there remained just two such  explosive formations in Russia, and flashes of instability in  the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria have shown how complicated  the republic's future can be if national elites reach agreement  with one another, while the "party in power"--no less interested  than Moscow in the existence of a unified  Kabardino-Balkaria--loses the ground on which it is standing.  <H5>  MAGOMEDOV </H5>   Magomed-Ali Magomedov rules the most complex--by ethnic  composition--republic in the Russian Federation. Dagestan is a  country whose present borders were outlined just after 1917, a  mountainous region on whose small flatlands clashed the  interests of the Avar, Lak, Dargin, Kumyk, Lezgin, Nogay, and a  great many other peoples, a land whose ethnic saturation and  intermingling many times exceeds that of sadly renowned Bosnia.  One cannot envy the leader of such a republic, especially since  Magomedov seems to have found himself in the top position by  accident. Since olden times Makhachkala has visibly observed the  "Lebanese" principle of distribution of leadership positions.  Magomedov, a Dargin, was appropriately appointed chairman of the  Council of Ministers and was elected chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of Dagestan, while the true head of the republic was the  first secretary of the Dagestan party obkom, an Avar by  nationality. However, the decay of party structures made  Magomedov "the number one man in Dagestan" and simultaneously--a  figure striving for caution and compromise even more than  yesterday's republic leaders from the party obkom. The striving  of the present leaders of Dagestan to "temporarily close down"  sociopolitical processes, related to their understanding of the  full danger of the interethnic conflicts in Dagestan and a  desire to counter the ambitions of new national movements,  constitutes conservatism at the very least. Magomedov has  seemingly become the personification of this course in the  republic, a republic that repudiated in referendum both the  introduction of presidential rule and the possibility of private  ownership of the land, as well as the symbol of a certain  "permanent temporariness" of the present Dagestan leadership.    Makhachkala is also restrained in its relations with Moscow.  Although President Yeltsin's standing in Dagestan is extremely  low, Magomedov refrained from harsh criticism of the president  even during the days of crisis, but at the same time did not  participate in the work of the Council of Heads of Republics,  where even the far more independent president of Tatarstan  appeared. But--that is what Magomedov is all about.  <H5>  NIKOLAYEV </H5>   The president of Yakutia is one of the most colorful  political figures on the republic scene. He has succeeded in  transforming himself into a leader on the federal level,  attaining prestige among his colleagues, and simultaneously  establishing decent contacts with the presidential  administration and with Boris Yeltsin. Even former Mordvinian  President Vasiliy Guslyannikov, far more inclined to support the  center, and one who declared his objection to republic  sovereignty (as opposed to Mikhail Nikolayev), could not boast  of one-tenth of such a relationship with the Russian  leadership--the center "noticed" him following his overthrow.    The bond of such status held by the president of Yakutia is  his resolute support of the Russian president during the crisis  months. Mikhail Nikolayev was the only regional leader to  participate in negotiations between the president and the  parliament on Boris Yeltsin's behalf. And this was not simply  support of a political position--it was primarily personal  solidarity.    It is precisely for this reason that Yakutia's economic  sovereignty is just about the most significant of all the  Russian republics, even when considering republics with a  "special position," like Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, or even  Chechnya. Mikhail Nikolayev was one of the first to sign a  bilateral agreement with Moscow, leaving Yakutia a significant  share of the profit from diamonds extracted in the republic. The  Yakut leaders engage in energetic foreign economic activity in  both the former Union republics and the "far abroad" (without  evoking censure from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  incidentally). Even following the October events of last year,  when Moscow's offensive against republic sovereignties began,  the president of Yakutia succeeded in preserving what had been  achieved, even in augmenting it. The Republic of Sakha became  one of the few regions of Russia where elections to a new  legislative organ were scheduled right after the Federation did  so. But even during the time of the old Supreme Soviet, Mikhail  Nikolayev managed to be the undisputed leader of his republic,  especially since he acceded to power in the classic manner,  substituting the presidential office for the post of first  secretary of the party obkom. If this highly experienced  politician continues to succeed in implementing in practice,  without complications, the model he has found of exchanging  political support for economic privileges, then diamond-rich  Yakutia, in the absence of external crises or confrontations  with the center, will find it much easier than other aspirants  to sovereignty to effect transformation into a "state within a  state," enjoying a special role in federal affairs.  <H5>  OORZHAK </H5>   The career of Sherig-ool Oorzhak, president of the Republic  of Tuva, is somewhat unusual. Holding the post of prime  minister, in August 1991 he lost the election to the position of  chairman of the Supreme Soviet to Kaadyr-ool Bicheldey. Then  just a few months later, Oorzhak was elected president and  chairman of the Government of Tuva in an election in which the  chairman of the parliament did not even run. But the president's  first loss resulted in further developments of the political  situation in the republic and altered mutual relations among the  power elite. Stated more simply, a great deal began to be  determined by the complex interaction between the president and  Supreme Soviet chairman, quite dissimilar leaders. Oorzhak, a  cadre party functionary who advanced through all the career  stages of the Tuva Party obkom administration and apparatus, has  exhibited an understandable loyalty to the federal executive  authority and was rather cautious in fighting for sovereignty of  the republic (which prior to 1944 was an independent state,  although in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union). The  chairman of the parliament, unexpectedly heading the republic  following the August events and reputed prior to this to be more  an oppositionist from the world of science, was able nonetheless  to find a common language with the fairly conservative body of  deputies and turned the Supreme Soviet into the major instrument  of sentiment towards sovereignization. As a result, an article  was secured in Tuva's new constitution on the prospect of its  withdrawal from the Russian Federation. And so the republic  president must take into account the sentiment in today's brand  new parliament, the popularity and influence of its  chairman--who kept his post, and the complete dependence to date  of Tuva's economy on federal grants. At the same time, Tuva's  monoethnicity--greater than that seen in many other Russian  republics, its border location, and historical traditions enable  the republic's leaders to continue a policy of sovereignization  without aggravating relations with the Kremlin or forcing events.  <H5>  POTAPOV </H5>   The chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Buryatia twice had  occasion to return himself to power in the republic. Leaving the  post of first secretary of the Buryat CPSU Obkom, he worked for  some time in Turkmenistan, but soon returned to Ulan-Ude to head  what had become the republic party obkom, which was then swept  away by the August 1991 events. However, in contrast to many  other first secretaries who left politics or shifted to  secondary roles, in just three months Leonid Potapov once again  headed the republic, becoming the chairman of its parliament.  These facts of Potapov's political biography alone illustrate  fairly well the durability of his standing in the republic with  the complex ethnic mix (additionally, Leonid Potapov himself is  Russian), a republic burdened not only with trying to maintain a  balance between the Russian majority and the indigenous  population but also with potential territorial problems. As a  result of all possible kinds of repartitionings, the Aga Buryat  and Ust-Orda Buryat Autonomous Okrugs find themselves located  outside the borders of Buryatia, in neighboring Siberian  oblasts, an occurrence unprecedented even for the Russian  Federation. Of course this has been influential in the  development of the national movement in Buryatia and on mutual  relations with its neighbors. For the time being, however,  Leonid Potapov has managed to skirt around the sharp edges of  these problems and has in fact established decent relations with  the leaders of Tuva and Khakassia. Beginning the search for its  own foreign policy channel, Ulaanbaatar is also watching  Ulan-Ude with understandable interest. Thus, Leonid Potapov has  potential for maneuver, although this has diminished somewhat in  recent times due to a certain lack of understanding between the  Supreme Soviet chairman and Buryatia Prime Minister Vladimir  Saganov, a politician with less traditional views who actively  supported Shakhray's Party of Russian Unity and Accord in the  elections, and who additionally is Buryat in nationality. The  upcoming election of president of the republic will constitute a  new and fairly significant ordeal for the rule of Leonid  Potapov. In this regard, the deep-rooted rivalry with Vladimir  Saganov may lead to the "Kalmyk" alternative--the departure of  both Buryat leaders from the political arena.  <H5>  RAKHIMOV </H5>   Recently elected president of Bashkortostan but for a long  time head of the Supreme Soviet of the republic, Murtaza  Rakhimov has been able to manifest himself as one of the most  influential, while at the same time most refined regional  leaders. Rakhimov's capabilities were fairly well demonstrated  during the recent election. Voters turned out in sufficient  numbers, rejected the draft Russian Constitution presented in  referendum, elected the head of the republic parliament as  president and as deputy to the Council of the Federation of  Russia, and then in voting for deputies to the State Duma--left  both Zhirinovskiy's party and Russia's Choice out in the cold,  showing preference for the "more reliable" Agrarian Party and  sympathizing with the regional problems of Shakhray's party. In  this manner, Murtaza Rakhimov has confirmed once again how great  is his prestige in the republic and how unlimited is the  potential in Bashkortostan's vertical chain of command.  Moreover, Rakhimov is in no way a "hereditary" party leader of  the former autonomy; he belongs to the next layer of the ruling  elite--the industrialists. Confirmation of the Supreme Soviet  chairman as undisputed number one man in the republic was a  complicated process and ended in replacement of the Bashkir  prime minister. In addition, the republic leadership has had to  take into account the complex ethnic composition of  Bashkortostan both in its internal politics and in its relations  with the center. The Bashkirs themselves constitute a minority  here, but taken together with the Tatars they surpass the entire  remainder of the populace in number. This circumstance was  probably not the least significant in influencing Ufa's choice  of a kind of "soft version" of Tatarstan politics: On the one  hand, Rakhimov affixed his signature to the Federation Treaty,  and on the other--achieved the signing of a virtually  simultaneous, closed, bilateral agreement with Moscow, giving  significant powers to the republic leadership in the economic  sphere and opening the way for an entire series of similar  bilateral treaties between the center and other republics.  Hardly anyone will deny that under the conditions the Russian  republics presently find themselves in, genuine sovereignty  comes down to the economy, and not ethnic considerations. Ufa  perhaps came to understand this sooner than others.    Rakhimov's resolute rejection of the actions of the  presidential team during the days of conflict between the  legislative and executive powers influenced somewhat the  solidity of his standing. At that time Bashkortostan undertook  steps--unexpectedly rigid for this republic--with respect to  legislative confirmation of its sovereignty, and a campaign of  propaganda was unleashed against Rakhimov in the Moscow  governmental mass media. But today perhaps this conflict is  already a thing of the past. Rakhimov was elected president. He  is one of the most influential deputies of the Council of the  Federation and, like many representatives of the regional elite,  is simply necessary to the Kremlin today.  <H5>  SPIRIDONOV </H5>   The chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Komi Republic has  been maintaining a successful balance to date between the center  and a group of opposition republic leaders. Taking into account  Komi's status in the Russian Federation, the degree to which  republic elites exert pressure on the Kremlin may depend on the  position of the Komi leader. In this regard, Yuriy Spiridonov  may be compared with Yakutia President Mikhail Nikolayev--the  Komi leader is devoting his main attention to economic  prerogatives of the republic (especially since Komis do not make  up a great part of the republic population; indeed, Yuriy  Spiridonov himself is Russian). We can also make the comparison  by career pattern. Spiridonov headed the Supreme Soviet of the  Komi Republic after spending many years in the party, a career  crowned by his election as first secretary of the Komi CPSU  Obkom (which career also included the position of prison warden,  showing that Spiridonov is no stranger to the realities of his  region). In confrontation with Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Khudyayev, Spiridonov has managed to date to sustain an  impressive victory. The Council of Ministers chairman, Komi by  nationality, has in practice supported an alternative draft  constitution for the republic which enhances its  sovereignization opportunities. Supreme Soviet deputies  supported the "Spiridonov draft," however, and today the leader  of the parliament has become a more substantive candidate for  the highest position in Komi--that of universally elected head  of the republic. Yuriy Spiridonov's expected success in the  election only promises to solidify his status among his  colleagues, who are somewhat bewildered by the Komi parliament's  recent refusal to introduce the office of president of the  republic. The adoption of the constitution shows, however, that  Spiridonov has simply postponed major decisions until the  post-October period, which will be more tranquil for him and  marked by a strengthening of the republic elite.  <H5>  STEPANOV </H5>   The chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Karelia is one of just  a few regional political figures also well known on the federal  level. He was among the most noticeable participants at the  deputy Congress (even heading the faction Communists of Russia  during the period of its greatest power), and was nominated as  this faction's candidate to the position of chairman of the  Russian Supreme Soviet as a counterweight to "democratic"  nominee Ruslan Khasbulatov (although today it is easy to  understand how much more moderate and pragmatic the Congress  would have been had it shown preference to the "communist"  alternative over the "democratic" one). He actively participated  in the negotiations process with the president and was one of  the initiators of the "crisis" council of regional leaders. A  political flexibility he acquired over long years working in the  apparatus helped Stepanov avoid turning into an odious figure  and helped him retain his position despite opposition attacks  after August 1991. It also helped him understand sooner than  others the prospects for "cautious" sovereignization. For the  Republic of Karelia, in which Russians constitute the  overwhelming majority of the population, this sovereignization  is exclusively economic in nature and can perhaps be viewed as  the "key" to possible analogous processes in the oblasts and  krays of Russia. This process is acquiring political overtones  because of a certain estrangement between the republic and  federal leadership, and because of the proximity to Finland.  Economic ties with Finland should be shored up by Karelia's  special ethnographic image. Incidentally, Viktor Stepanov is  Karelian in nationality and heads a parliament in which only a  few Karelians are deputies. This is a problem in itself.    In recent times, due to an emerging conflict between  parliament and the government that resolutely supported Boris  Yeltsin in 1993, some observers cite a weakening of Stepanov's  standing. Already he is not being perceived as the consolidator  of the republic elite. Even if we surmise that Viktor Stepanov  will be forced to leave Petrozavodsk, however, this would hardly  signify an end to his political career. The Karelian leader has  sufficiently strong ties and prestige both in Moscow and among  his colleagues in the leadership positions of the Russian  republics.  <H5>  TUBYLOV </H5>   Chairman of the Udmurt Supreme Soviet Valentin Tubylov is  one  of the energetic members of the Volga group of leaders of the  Russian republics gravitating most toward sovereignty. Although  it must be immediately acknowledged that the economic prospects  of Udmurtia, one of the most important ancestral lands of the  military-industrial complex of the former Union (it is not by  chance that its capital, Izhevsk, was at one time called  "Ustinov" in honor of the famous "patriarch" of the  military-industrial complex), can hardly be compared with the  prospects of Tatarstan or Bashkiria. Tubylov, therefore, in  addition to acceding to the highest post in the republic without  the obkom career traditional for many leaders (he headed just  one party raykom [rayon committee] and a sovkhoz vocational  school), may not be able to render his colleagues anything more  than political support. But here too certain problems may arise:  within Udmurtia--the Supreme Soviet chairman has not built a  relationship with leaders of the government. The parliament  replaced Nikolay Mironov, who came to power in the republic  simultaneously with Tubylov. Concerning the new head of  government, Aleksandr Volkov, however, "the honeymoon is over"  (although it is the prime minister, like the recent head of the  apparatus of the Federal Assembly, Vladimir Podoprigor, adhering  to centrist views, who will represent Udmurtia in the Council of  the Federation). The future political biography of Valentin  Tubylov will therefore be determined to a great degree by the  prospects of all the Volga republics and the fortress of their  informal "coalition."      Nikolay Fedorov, the recently elected president of the  Chuvash Republic, could turn out to be the "dark horse" among  republic leaders were it not for his preceding political  biography. Fedorov is a political figure on the federal level  who left Moscow for Cheboksary--an atypical act at first glance,  but further regionalization of the country may make such steps  the rule rather than the exception in the game of Russian  political chess. A lawyer by profession, Fedorov bound his  career to Gorbachev's perestroyka. He was one of the many USSR  people's deputies "withheld" in power thanks to the  multi-candidate parliamentary elections in the Soviet Union.  Nikolay Fedorov was minister of justice of Russia in the  cabinets of Ivan Silayev and Yegor Gaydar. After the August  events, however, a crevice appeared between him and the  presidential administration. Specifically, the minister of  justice came out in opposition to the establishment of a unified  Ministry of Security and Ministry of Internal Affairs of the  Russian Federation, and when Boris Yeltsin announced proposals  for a special procedure for governing the country in spring of  last year, he resigned. Like another former minister, Sergey  Glazyev, Fedorov ran for deputy to the Russian Federation State  Duma on the slate of Nikolay Travkin's opposition Democratic  Party of Russia. But immediately following the resignation of  Fedorov, who initially did not issue sharp statements,  conjecture surfaced that his departure was related to a desire  to occupy the office of president of Chuvashia. However, even  confirmation of such conclusions shows that the future president  understood in time that success in the republic could be  achieved only at a great distance from the Kremlin. For this  reason one can foresee that in the office of president of  Chuvashia, Nikolay Fedorov can hardly be expected to become an  ally of his recent colleagues in the Russian Government. The  former minister of justice will probably easily find like-minded  thinkers among the presidents of the neighboring Volga  republics. The results of the election in Chuvashia can only  intensify the already existing gravitation of Volga republics  toward greater independence.  <H5>  KHUBIYEV </H5>   One of the final resolutions of the Supreme Soviet of  Karachay-Cherkessia on the eve of parliamentary elections in  this republic was the decision to entrust the functions of head  of republic to Prime Minister Vladimir Khubiyev. In this manner,  the Supreme Soviet acknowledged a fact long known to all in the  republic which somewhat differentiated its political system from  that of other Federation entities: that it was the prime  minister, and not the Supreme Soviet chairman, who was the  leader of the republic, the "uncrowned president" of  Karachay-Cherkessia. Khubiyev has been the leader of  Karachay-Cherkessia since 1979, when he was elected chairman of  the ispolkom [executive committee] of the Soviet of People's  Deputies of the autonomous oblast. His commanding position was  confirmed as well by edict of President Yeltsin, who appointed  Khubiyev acting head of administration of Karachay-Cherkessia,  and by resolution of the Supreme Soviet which confirmed him as  prime minister, and now as head of the republic. Karachay by  nationality, Khubiyev seems to be living proof that it is  possible for a united Karachay-Cherkessia to exist--which  certain national movements have attempted to oppose with  separate nation-state formations. In addition, it is important  to take into account the indisputable influence Khubiyev wields  within the most diverse political circles of his republic, in  order to understand how closely intertwined the very existence  of the Karachay-Cherkess Republic is with the personality of its  leader.  <H5>  CHAPTYNOV </H5>   Valeriy Chaptynov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the  Altay Republic, managed to accede to power in a somewhat  unexpected manner: At a time when, in other autonomies, it was  the first secretaries of party obkoms that headed the soviets,  as a rule, Chaptynov was first elected chairman of the  Gorno-Altay Oblast Soviet, and only then elected first secretary  of the Gorno-Altay Party Obkom. A cadre Komsomol and party  functionary (very few--even of Chaptynov's colleagues among the  leaders of republics can boast of such a personal history, which  includes just about all the possible jobs on the oblast level),  Chaptynov maintained a consistently conservative stance during  the days of crisis. He supported the activities of the GKChP  [State Committee for the State of Emergency] in August 1991 and  sided with the opponents of President Boris Yeltsin in  September-October 1993. However, this did not sway the standing  of Valeriy Chaptynov in the republic. Attempts to remove him  following the August events did not meet with success and after  October, the Supreme Soviet chairman won a confident victory in  the election to the Council of the Federation of the Russian  Federation (the second seat went to Vladimir Petrov, chairman of  the Government of Altay, whose positions in no way always  coincide with the views of the speaker). Clearly the leader of  the Altay Republic not only occupies a solid position within the  power elite of the region--he also knows very well the moods of  the voters in this small, mountainous country.  <H5>  SHAYMIYEV </H5>   The president of Tatarstan has managed to become one of the  acknowledged leaders among the heads of the Russian  republics--thanks to Kazan's special view of the future status  of the Republic of Tatarstan, which did not sign the Federation  Treaty and also did not declare its independence (as did  Chechnya), but rather agreed to sign a heretofore unprecedented  bilateral treaty defining the relationship between the Russian  Federation and Tatarstan, and also thanks to his methods of  asserting his position. This position is traditionally far from  extremist. From the very beginning, when the republic declared  its special position (in particular, it strove to independently  sign the Union Treaty), the president of Tatarstan attempted to  be more an active participant in the negotiations process than  an orator reciting slogans on sovereignty. The course he  pursued, not well perceived initially by the Russian center, was  later applied to other republics. Following the rejection of  inclusion of the text of the Federation Treaty into the Russian  Federation Constitution, bilateral "republic-Kremlin" contacts  and contacts among republics in general may now become  prevailing.    For the sake of fairness it should be recalled that even in  the old Union hierarchy, the first secretary of the Tatar party  obkom (and Mintimer Shaymiyev held this post) occupied a special  position hardly comparable with the position of the other first  secretaries/leaders of autonomies: A place was "reserved" for  him not just in the CPSU Central Committee, but in the Presidium  of the USSR Supreme Soviet as well (as was the case for the  first secretaries of the capital--Moscow and Leningrad--party  committees). If only for this reason, Shaymiyev had no special  problem standing out among his colleagues. But as an experienced  administrator, he knew full well that maintaining tranquility in  a republic undergoing sovereignization, where half the  population was non-Tatar, depended on economic stability and the  prevention of interethnic conflict in Tatarstan. Here the  president of Tatarstan can be compared with the president of  neighboring Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. It is no accident  that in both the case of Kazakhstan and that of Tatarstan, this  concept proved its worth. In any event, the majority of  Tatarstan voters participate (or more accurately--do not  participate) in federal events behind the republic leaders.  Whereas following the August (1991) events, Kazan was the party  more interested in concluding an agreement with Moscow, today  the leadership of Tatarstan is quite happy to maintain the  current ambiguous status. So much simpler it is for President  Shaymiyev to appear as an arbiter between Tatar national forces  advocating independence for the republic and the parliamentary  opposition oriented on the center, which believes that  Tatarstan's status must be determined on "common" principles  (these "common" principles change with time, incidentally, and  will do so a good many times more in favor of the Kazan  Kremlin--the residence of the Tatarstan president).  <H5>  SHTYGASHEV </H5>   Vladimir Shtygashev, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of  Khakassia, is perhaps the most irreconcilable enemy of the  presidential administration to be found among the leaders of the  republics. To the very last day, Shtygashev was a consistent  supporter of the leaders of the White House (in a recent  interview for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA he again named Ruslan  Khasbulatov "a great Russian patriot"). He was among the  initiators of the idea to create an "alternative" council of  regional leaders, and travelled to the White House on an  intermediary mission along with President of Kalmykia Kirsan  Ilyumzhinov and President of Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev. However,  whereas Ilyumzhinov and Aushev, like many other creators of the  "alternative" council, managed almost immediately following the  October events to smooth up tensions arising in their relations  with the Kremlin, Shtygashev stuck to his previous positions and  categorically refused to run for the new Russian parliament.    Taking into account the remoteness of Khakassia from the  centers of power, we can presume that Moscow will hardly  undertake a serious attack in the near future against the  authority of Vladimir Shtygashev. Especially since even in  Abakan itself, the position of the Supreme Soviet chairman is  complicated by difficult relations not only with the prime  minister--traditionally closer to the executive power, but also  with his own first deputy, whose orientation is alongside Moscow  democrats. Vladimir Shtygashev's regional views are simpler,  although he leads a republic transformed from a former  autonomous oblast and detached from what is now the neighboring  Krasnoyarsk Kray. Nonetheless, Abakan and Krasnoyarsk today  share not only a certain political mutual understanding, but  also active participation in the "Siberian Agreement"--converted  from an economic alliance into the embryo of a kind of new  regional formation in Siberia. National status can hardly be  expected to hinder Khakassia from participating in the creation  and construction of such a formation. After all, Khakass people  comprise not more than 12 percent of the population here, and  republic leaders themselves treat the republic's independence  primarily as an economic consideration.    It cannot be ruled out that these comments provide far from  an exhaustive treatment of the palette of regional power in the  Russian Federation--of course it is far from exhaustive! It  would probably be a very difficult task today to draw "a  collective political portrait" of the leaders of the oblasts and  krays of the Russian Federation. However, it was equally  impossible until quite recently to turn to portraits of the  leaders of republics, although we have here the very same  people... The complex situation in the country and permanent  sovereignization processes have turned the leaders of the  republics into politicians. Are we not dealing with similar  processes (perhaps they would be better termed processes of  regionalization) when we look at the oblasts and krays? No, it  is still to early to mark the end of the cycle "The Face of  Power or the Power of Faces?"

headline:    Stavropol Prepares for Local Elections 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Lyudmila Beldyugina, Stavropol: "Elections in   the Regions: A Little More, and They Will Get Into a  Hand-to-Hand Fight...."]    [Text] Once again, the Inner Council of people's deputies  unanimously (with one abstention) affirmed its former decision  regarding the numerical size of the State Duma of Stavropol  Kray, whose elections are scheduled for 27 March.    What is more, the deputies decided to turn to the judicial  organs, including the appeals and supervisory courts with  complaint statements about declaring invalid the decree of the  electoral commission of the kray on the elections to local  organs of authority "Concerning the Organization of 25 Electoral  Districts" and its other decrees that were adopted in defiance  of the kray council.    The Inner Council also sent documents to the Supreme Soviet  of the Russian Federation, appealing against a decision of the  kray people's court, which refused to examine its complaint to  the kray electoral commission. Thus, the dispute between the  representative and executive branches of authority in the kray  has entered a more acute phase.    The gist of the delayed and by no means concluded dispute is  the following. In January of this year, already not for the  first time, the Inner Council once again ratified the decision:  Forty-two deputies will work on a permanent basis in the State  Duma of Stavropol Kray. But the administration of the kray is  insisting on 25, of which, in its opinion, only 10 deputies  should work on a permanent basis, and it is also insisting on  increasing the percentage of signatures of voters for the  nomination of candidates for deputy from 3 to 5 percent.    These proposals were interpreted by members of the Inner  Council as a frank desire of the current administration to form  an obedient representative authority that it had in its pocket.  After all, the more signatures that future candidates will have  to collect, the easier it will be for the executive authority,  which has a powerful apparatus, to push its own people into key  posts, mainly heads of local administrations, believes Yevgeniy  Borodin, a member of the kray council and an activist of the  Democratic Russia movement. Many kray, oblast, and city dumas  are being formed today according to this principle. He reported  that after a meeting of the Inner Council, which affirmed its  previous decisions, the deputies learned about the decree of the  head of kray administration, Yevgeniy Kuznetsov, in which the  numerical size of the future duma of 25 deputies apparently is  legalized. The kray electoral commission is also adopting a  similar decree to please the governor.    Briefly, the elections are just around the corner, but the  dispute is heating up in earnest. The people's deputies believe  that the 25 districts--according to the number of candidates for  deputy--that were organized by the kray commission are illegal  and that the competence of the deputies in them can be disputed,  which creates a basis for the instability of future authorities  and the sociopolitical situation in the kray.    "Supporting our assumptions that the kray administration  will  create an obedient authority is the fact that the first  registered candidates for deputy of the kray duma are entirely  representatives of executive authority," asserts Ye. Borodin.

headline:    Maritime Kray Candidate Lists Compiled 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Marina Loboda, VLADIVOSTOK: "One Hundred Fifty   Candidates Nominated to Kray Duma"]    [Text] Lists of contenders for seats in the  representative organ of authority in the kray have been compiled  in the kray's electoral commission.    According to preliminary data, 150 Maritime Kray residents  are contending for 39 seats (on the average, 3.85 persons per  seat). Of these, 129 are men and 21 are women.    The greatest political activity was noted in the 14th  Electoral District (Frunzenskiy Rayon of the city of  Vladivostok). Eight contenders were nominated here, which is  explained by the considerable size of the district--more than  57,000 persons.    The minimal possible number of contenders was nominated in  nine districts--two persons each, which could be an indication  of the low interest in politics among the population, as well as  an indicator of the serious approach of the citizens to the  evaluation of their political data.    An overwhelming majority of the contenders are managerial  workers, and an increased interest in politics has been noted  among doctors. Given a closer examination of the list, one could  find in it: metal workers--one, lathe workers--one, and  sailors--one.    On the other hand, 37 former people's deputies decided to  take this path once again. Among them--six former chairmen of  soviets at all levels.    No less active were the presently functioning authoritative  structures: 15 heads of administration of rayons and cities of  the kray are tying their future fate to the kray duma. The  greatest activity here was displayed by officials of the kray  center: Six representatives of the city administration and six  from the kray administration intend to expand their  authoritative powers at the expense of duma seats. It is  impossible not to note the fact of the inclusion in the  political campaign of A. Pavlov, deputy governor of the kray,  who was on the point of receding into the shadows.    The Zvezda plant took first place among the enterprises of  the kray. Right off there were four contenders for a seat in the  duma--is this not conversion?

headline:    Maritime Kray Official on RF Pension Fund 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Interview with P.M. Nazarov, manager of the Maritime Kray   department of the Pension Fund, by I. Permyakova, UTRO ROSSII  correspondent; place and date not given: "Why This Pension Fund  Is Necessary"]    [Text] A decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian  Federation on the establishment of the Pension Fund of Russia  (PFR) was adopted on 27 December 1991, and a pertinent statute  was developed. The obligation of the fund is "to ensure the  collection of insurance premiums necessary to finance the  payment of state pensions, while fully making good use of the  rights granted to it for these purposes." But it was necessary  for this to organize a state data bank by the end of 1992 on the  payers of insurance premiums to the PFR....to initiate  preparatory work on the organization of an individual account of  mandatory insurance premiums coming in from working citizens,  keeping in mind in the future to increase the size of state  pensions owing to the resources they contribute.    By no means all of our readers understand what the  basic functions of the Pension Fund include and what  specifically required its creation, and therefore I. Permyakova,  our correspondent, turned for an explanation to P.M. Nazarov,  the manager of the Maritime Kray department of the Pension  Fund.    "Our fund," explained Pavel Mikhaylovich, "is federal, and  therefore, we transfer a considerable part of the collected  resources to Moscow. But the gist of it is in the following.  According to the law, each employer must participate in the  establishment of the PFR, just as every employee must who is  accepted for work. In addition, the employer pays 28 percent of  his income monthly, and the worker, 1 percent. This is done  somewhat differently in the civilized countries of the West:  When a person assumes one or another position, an account is  opened in his name in an appropriate insurance company to which  a certain percentage of wages is transferred and frozen there  until the worker goes on pension. In Finland, for example, a  person does not have to go for his social security after he  becomes a pensioner: They will come to his home and process  everything. If he transfers from one enterprise to another, his  personal account follows him, as before remaining inviolable.  It is not this way in our country: Monetary inflation does not  make it possible for us to operate in the European fashion;  money is being devalued. Therefore, this kind of solution was  found: Collect 28 percent from any organization and 1 percent  from the person who works in it. It turns out that the one who  is working now provides for the old age of the generation that  has left for a rest.... And our main task is to finance the  payment of pensions.    [Permyakova] So that it turns out: It is not enough that  you work for the people of Maritime Kray--you also finance  Moscow?    [Nazarov] I will explain: There are 88 territorial  (regional) okrugs in Russia. There are such oblasts and krays  (Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays and Tambov and Kursk Oblasts, and  some others) that were always subsidized, but in the Far East  there are very many people who work here (especially fishermen),  but who are registered in the Western part of Russia. They will  not be able to make use of the resources transferred from  enterprises to the local Pension Fund, owing to which a specific  surplus is established that we transfer to the center for their  maintenance. Actually, in [line of text missing] more than 50  billion rubles [R].    [Permyakova] Well, nonetheless, was there a need to  establish your fund?    [Nazarov] Judge for yourself. Previously, resources for the  payment of pensions were placed in the budget. But inasmuch as  the social sphere was always financed according to the residual  principle--the resources set aside for its needs were spent on  all kinds of things!--there was practically no money left to  fortify the welfare of the indigent strata of the population.  In connection with the changes in the economy of the country,  the idea came up about separating the pension fund from the  budget, so that no one would be able to use it for unplanned  purposes.    [Permyakova] Did I understand correctly that owing to the  collection of resources, the Pension Fund can increase the  amount of payments to groups of the population that are poorly  protected against inflation?    [Nazarov] Correct. But, unfortunately, we are still  collecting much less than we could. After all, many enterprises  are on the brink of bankruptcy. Many large enterprises are our  debtors: R8 billion for the fishermen, R5 billion for  enterprises of the defense complex and R4 billion for the  Ministry of Defense, and R3 billion for the nonferrous metals  industry--for a total of R26 billion. Under an optimal variant,  we receive up to R40 billion. Our task consists precisely of  collecting, controlling, and using these resources. On the  whole, we transfer up to R27 billion to social protection  organs. We levy fines on enterprises that hide their  indebtedness, and we direct the sums received for social  protection [one or two lines missing] last year we gave R1.768  billion for these purposes. In addition, R1.325 billion went  for rendering material assistance; for health improvement and  convalescence of participants and invalids of the Great  Patriotic War--R56 million; and for boarding school houses and  shelters and for their reconstruction and the construction of  new buildings of this designation--R121 million. The Red Cross  and the organization of medical-social assistance to solitary  people and people of old age at home received R10 million. One  hundred million rubles were given directly to social security  departments.    [Permyakova] In light of the inflation, these figures could  prove to be inadequate....    [Nazarov] This year we plan to transfer R6 billion for all  such needs, and a billion was already given for the first  quarter by 20 February.    [Permyakova] It is no secret that many enterprises are  really in catastrophic condition and are increasing the  percentage of so-called hidden unemployment, when people are  forcefully sent on leave without maintenance. How can they  settle accounts with you?    [Nazarov] We take all of this into consideration. If an  enterprise is trying to be honest with us and with its own  workers, we give an extension. But those who have enough money  both for wages and construction, but who evade payment of the  pension tax--we fine these harshly, and Moscow is requiring  tough measures from us. In 1993, we exacted R3.869 billion from  violators. At the same time, the government decided to forgive  the indebtedness of those enterprises [line missing] that cannot  pay their workers even the minimum wage....    [Permyakova] Pavel Mikhaylovich, the attention of our  readers was attracted by a note in one of the city newspapers,  "Do not take money from grandmothers." Some people understood  this to mean that the Pension Fund does not support them.... Is  it possible that the notorious Pension Fund also takes from old  people?    [Nazarov] In no way! A pension tax is not collected on any  kind of stipends, benefits, and pensions! In this case, the  question exactly concerns the concealment of one's incomes and  corresponding indebtedness to the Pension Fund of a large number  of enterprises, owing to which pensioners also do not receive  what they have coming to them. But, by the way, the Pension  Fund itself does not engage either in the payment of pensions,  or in rendering social assistance to the indigent strata of the  population. These things, as I have already mentioned, are  handled by the social protection organs, but we finance them.  For the payment of pensions in the kray, R137.5 billion were  expended from PFR resources, and for social protection--R1.768  billion (while the note for some reason indicates a total of  R120 million, which constituted allegedly 60 percent of what was  planned). It should be known that only resources collected from  violators are directed to the social protection of the aged.  The work will be perfected, control will be improved on the  part of our employees, the sums of fines will be increased, and,  consequently, more resources will be directed to social  protection [line missing] Pension Fund is established in order  that its resources go only for the needs of the people of scanty  means. This money is kept in banks; we do not see the cash, it  can be used temporarily only by the bank, and last year we  received R1.560 billion from banks for the use of our resources,  and we paid various taxes of R510 million into the budget.    [Permyakova] Pavel Mikhaylovich, one more, indelicate  question, which an American would not answer. But life is life,  and as long as the majority is infringed upon in its earnings,  people cannot help but be interested in what the average wage of  your workers is.    [Nazarov] Well, it is a good and lawful question. First, I  will note that we do not set the wages for ourselves; they are  established by Moscow--by the federal organs of social  administration. Yes, we have a decent wage. It is R275,000,  and we hope that it will grow. We take into account years of  service, and we add on bonuses. For what? Workers of the  Pension Fund monitor 26,000 enterprises of various types [two  lines missing] 8,551, and of these, violations of established  payment procedures were disclosed in 7,516 (and this is 88  percent of the number that were checked!) and about R4 million  was recovered! Each worker of our fund has to make 50  checkups--almost as much as there are weeks in a year. Numerous  beginning commercial structures try especially hard to evade tax  payments, and we find them through the banks and tax  inspectorates. It happens that they tear up our acts there,  threaten and taunt us, muddle up accounts, although all that  they have to do is to calculate wages, transfer 28 percent from  the monthly incomes of enterprises and 1 percent from each  worker. But no, almost everyone is a violator. But after all,  each of us will sooner or later move into the pensioner  category....    [Permyakova] Have you, Pavel Mikhaylovich, been associated  with the financial structure for a long time?    [Nazarov] I am a financier to the marrow of my bones. I  graduated from a financial institute more than 30 years ago. I  worked in a bank for 13 years as chief [line missing] of the  financial administration of the kray executive committee, and  from 1991 I became the manager of the Pension Fund. I was born  in Amur Oblast, and I have been living in Vladivostok since 1955.

headline:    Arkhangelsk Post-Election Political Scene Surveyed 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by Viktor Filippov, IZVESTIYA staff: "Arkhangelsk   Politicians Do Their Jobs and Do Not Fight With Anyone"]    [Text] Arkhangelsk--Arkhangelsk is like Odessa in felt  boots: people are never at a loss for words here, either. The  impressive building of the oblast party committee, located, as  it should be, int he very center of the city, has been  sarcastically dubbed the "accordion." Not so much for its  architecture as for the "music" that came out of it, music to  which the entire Maritime Oblast used to dance. The nickname was  kept during the time of the building's next tenant: the oblast  soviet. Evidently its "music" too closely resembled the party  music.    And since last 12 December the famous building became the  residence of the new representative authority--on that day  Maritime Oblast residents elected their oblast assembly. Whether  the ironic legacy will attach itself to the assembly, we won't  try to guess. So far, people in Arkhangelsk speak of their  parliament without irony. And we also will take a look at it  with serious eyes, since such elections lie ahead for other  regions of Russia, as well.  <H6>  Mirror of the Russian Provinces </H6>   Thirty-five deputies were elected to the 41 seats in the  Arkhangelsk Oblast Assembly. Elections of six more are to be  completed at the end of March. The new deputy corps has provided  some idea of what can be expected from province authorities  today.    First of all, professionalism. The communist patriots'  favorite argument about the cook a the helm of state has been  totally refuted. All the deputies to the oblast assembly have  higher-school diplomas and are between 30 and 60 years of age,  which is considered the most productive for work. Fifteen  deputies are executives of industrial, construction and  agricultural enterprises, eight are from rayon and rural  administrations, and the rest are physicians, teachers, lawyers  and journalists.    Second, the province clearly does not want a revival of  Soviet practices. Only nine of the legislators out of 35 were  formerly deputies to a soviet.    And third, the voters are hoping that their deputies will  engage in lawmaking, not political struggle. Maritime Oblast  inhabitants have elected to their oblast assembly only those who  have not linked themselves unreservedly to any one party or  movement.    "We don't have any factions," says Nikolay Isakov, chairman  of the oblast assembly. "We have come here in order to put the  oblast's economy in order, and one's political coloring is  unimportant for economic laws.  <H6>  Speaker-Diplomat </H6>   Nikolay Isakov is 47 years of age. He was born on the Pinega  River and is a fellow countryman of the writer Fedor Abramov.  And he himself is an exceptional person for the Arkhangelsk  backwoods. He was graduated from the Friendship of People's  University in Moscow, is a historian and economist by training,  and is fluent in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. He worked in  Cuba on the staff of an economic adviser. Then he governed  Pinezhskiy Rayon as head of the administration. It was through  his diligence that a museum was opened in Fedor Abramov's house  in the village of Verkola, and that a granite monument was  placed on the writer's grave. The rayon chief has accomplished a  number of other, perhaps more prosaic, but equally good deeds,  for which Pinezhskiy Rayon's inhabitants elected him to the  oblast parliament. And when the assembly's deputies were  deciding who should be speaker, Nikolay Isakov proved to be  without competitors.    "There is nothing for us to divide up with the executive  authority," Nikolay Isakov believes. "The oblast administration  is working hard to enable the producer of goods to operate  normally. And we will use the means at our disposal to try to  accomplish the same objective. Saving jobs in remote areas means  saving the people who live there. But where are the muzhiks in a  forest village to go if their only timber station closes. And  what will they feed their children?"    An interesting note: the "accordion" has its own cafeteria,  but the speaker has made a habit of dining in the oblast  administration building, with the governor. According to Nikolay  Isakov, it is better to go over common problems in an informal  atmosphere.  <H6>  Not a Word About Privileges </H6>   Of the 41 deputies to the oblast assembly, 16 may work on a  permanent basis. But only three professionals have joined the  speaker and two deputy speakers. The rest of the deputies have  not quit their jobs. The deputies meet in Arkhangelsk only once  a month--for a session that lasts five days.    The oblast assembly began its work at the same time as the  State Duma. But while their colleagues in Moscow were arguing  over what privileges to establish for themselves, the  Arkhangelsk legislators were concerned with the socioeconomic  state of the oblast, its budget, local tax rates and the  structure of local government. None of the deputies said a word  about privileges for themselves.    "It's disgraceful, to stuff one's own pockets at the expense  of the impoverished people," Nikolay Isakov says.    The Arkhangelsk parliament lives modestly. Only the chairman  has an official car. The deputies are reimbursed for their hotel  and travel to sessions. They also have the free use of city  transportation, except for taxis, of course. The oblast  assembly's staff is half the size of the deputy corps. Those who  work on a permanent basis receive salaries: the speaker's is  equal to the governor's, his deputies get the same as the  vice-governor, the chairman of a standing commission gets the  same as the director of an administration, and so forth.    "Sensible deputies have been elected," says Governor Pavel  Balakshin. "This is no longer the same thing as the former  oblast soviet, which contrived to govern everything. I express  my own position at sessions of the oblast assembly, and even if  it differs from the deputies', we find agreement."    Nonetheless, I am wary of drawing the conclusion that the  elections of local parliaments that are slated for the end of  March in many regions of Russia will bring long-awaited  political peace as has been the case in Arkhangelsk. Practically  everywhere, heads and deputy heads of administrations of various  levels are running for deputies. Seven of such "dual job  holders" have gotten onto the Arkhangelsk Oblast Assembly.  However, it is not out of the question that the dual job holders  will take the majority in the parliaments of other oblasts, and  that the representative branch will be suppressed by the  executive branch. Consequently, autocratic regimes may be  established on part of Russian territory.    Our country has many faces, and there is no doubt that the  regions' bodies of representative authority should be in accord  with their historical traditions. But at the same time, there is  a need for a federal law on the general principles of local  authority that would guarantee the indivisibility of Russia. And  it makes good sense that the March elections in the regions  should be postponed until the time when the State Duma adopts  such a law.

headline:    Smolensk Agrarian Party Conference Detailed 
text:  Language:   Russian   Article Type:CSO     [Article by I. Petrov: "The Future Is for the APR [Agrarian   Party of Russia], Believe Oblast Conference Delegates"]    [Text] The regional section of the Agrarian Party of  Russia, is perhaps the youngest in the multiparty list of the  Smolensk region. Organizationally, it was formed a little over a  month ago. However, in its numbers (around 400 members), the APR  is far from being in last place. And this is understandable: Our  oblast has long been called agrarian. Moreover, the APR won a  certain authority in Russia during the elections to the State  Duma, where it received representation among eight parties and  movements. Organizations of the APR have been created in 70  regions of Russia.    This fact was reiterated at the recently held oblast  conference of the APR. The chairman of the party organization,  A. S. Ignatenkov, justifying the need for unification of  agrarians of the Smolensk region into a party, recalled the  oblast conference on agriculture which was held two years ago.  Even at that time the conclusion was drawn that reforms are  being implemented not in the interests of the farm workers. A  coordinating committee was elected, which prepared documents  containing proposals and demands of the rural residents to the  local administration and the government, organized picketing,  etc. The result was zero. Evidently, they made the rounds of the  offices and pleaded in vain. It was necessary to opt for extreme  measures--not to supply products. But, on the other hand, the  coordinating committee did not have any powers and authorities.  The creation of the party introduces the work on defending the  interests of the peasantry into a constitutional channel. This  was the specific guideline during the creation of the APR by its  founders, among which the main role belonged to the trade unions  and the Ministry of Agriculture. A. Rutskoy was also of great  help.    What is the APR trying to achieve, and what are its tasks  today? First of all, it is necessary to stop the disintegration  and the pilferage of agricultural structures which had been  decades in the making. The head of the Smolensk organization of  the APR, A. S. Ignatenkov, has long been well known, including  also outside the oblast, as the chairman of the leading kolkhoz  "Zarya" in Pochinkovskiy Rayon. The achievements of this farm in  the sphere of production as well as in the social-domestic  sphere were widely publicized not only in the local, but also in  the central press. However, in the words of A. S. Ignatenkov, it  was not necessary to do anything brilliant in order to obtain 40  quintals of grain crops from a hectare and a 4,000 liter milk  yield. The main thing was that a good material base was created  and, were it not for the reforms, not tens but hundreds of farms  in the oblast would have such indicators today. We could feed  not only ourselves, but Poland too. Yet today even the recent  "beacons" cannot make ends meet: The problem lies in selling the  produced product, in getting money for it.    The statements of farm managers F. S. Vasilyev and V. D.  Komarova, who are well known in the Smolensk region, resounded  with concern already for the near future of the farm. Oblast  leaders today have forgotten their pre-electoral promises to see  to the needs of the peasants. Despite the invitations, not one  administration representative came to the conference. To hear  them talk--everything is fine with us. Yet catastrophe is not  far away--there is simply nothing with which to sow the current  Spring planting in the Smolensk region, not to mention the  problems with equipment, spare parts and fuel. Where and for  what means are the current joint-stock companies supposed to buy  all of this, if even an excellent flax crop, for which medals  were given before, brings only losses?    The APR does not have time for political discussions. It  does  not aspire to any bright color in today's political spectrum.  Its goals and tasks are in keeping with those facing the trade  unions. And it is no accident that the trade unions are among  the founders of the party, and it is no accident that at the  conference (it was held in the oblsovprof [oblast soviet of  trade unions]) the tasks for creating and stepping up the  actions of the local APR organizations were placed before the  trade union raykom [rayon committee] chairmen.    Speaking at the conference, the oblast committee chairman of  the trade union of workers in the agricultural industry, V. A.  Yakovlev (he is also the co-chairman of the oblast organization  of the APR), noted that the APR is a party not only of farm  workers, but of everyone who holds dear the needs of our farms.  Ultimately, the well-being of everyone depends on the degree to  which these needs are met. This is specifically why the future  is for the APR. And we do not need to forcefully drag anyone  into the party, to inflate its membership numbers. The Agrarian  Party is open to constructive cooperation with all parties and  movements, but will not itself seek alliance with anyone. For  now, the agrarians are in closest contact with the communists.    A separate point on the conference agenda was the question  of  nominating candidates to the oblast duma. An agreement was  reached on support of previously nominated candidates by the  APR. It turned out that among these were also the heads of the  Rudnanskiy, Pochinkovskiy and Kholm-Chirkovskiy administrations.  The candidates for deputy in the oblast duma nominated by the  APR were P. Ye. Demyanov (Yartsevo) and V. A. Yakovlev.    An oblast organization council was created at the  conference,  and all participations were given party tickets of a pleasant  green color. We have only to hope that the Agrarian Party will  be able to help the peasants as well as us, the city residents,  to live through the current difficult times.

headline:    Magazine Executives Arrested 
text:  BFN     [Excerpts] Lagos, 11 Apr (PANA) -- The chief executive of  Nigeria's influential Lagos-based weekly news magazine,  NEWSWATCH, Ray Ekpu, has been arrested along with his deputy,  Yakubu Mohamed, the magazine said. An official of the  publication said that Ekpu and Mohamed were arrested in Lagos  and northern city of Lokoja at the weekend.    No official reason was given for their arrest by state  security officials, which followed the arrest Thursday [7 April]  of the magazine's editor-in-chief, Dan Agbese. The arrests are  believed to be in connection with last week's NEWSWATCH  interview with an official of the old administration of Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida which ruled from 1985 to 1992. [passage  omitted]    Some media and human rights organisations, in separate  statements after Agbese's arrest, condemned the action as a new  wave of media clampdown in the West African country, which is  acclaimed to have one of the freest press in Africa. The  organisations include the Nigerian Union of Journalists and the  Nigerian Magazine Publishers Association.    "Events in the recent past have shown that unlawful  harassments of media practitioners have never achieved any  positive results for the government," the association said.    Agbese, Mohamed and Ekpu, left the NATIONAL CONCORD  publication of millionaire Moshood Abiola in 1983 to set up  NEWSWATCH, whose founding editor-in-chief, Dele Giwa was killed  in a parcel bomb delivered to his Lagos home in 1986. There has  been no arrest or prosecution of Dele's killers, some eight  years after his slaying.

headline:    Mark on Government Reaction to Remarks 
text:  BFN     [Interview with retired Brigadier General David Mark by   Jeremy Skiss in London; date not given; from the "Focus on  Africa" program -- first paragraph is announcer's introduction]    [Text] The military government in Nigeria has accused a  retired general of threatening the country's stability. The man  at the center of the controversy is former Brigadier General  David Mark, one of the officers who backed the coup which  brought General Abacha to power last November. In an interview  in NEWSWATCH magazine last week, Gen. Mark accused the ruling  council of having a hidden agenda and of planning to stay in  power for another five years instead of one year as agreed  before the coup. Since the coup, Gen. Mark has been retired  early from the Armed Forces and is now living in London. When  he came into the studio, Jeremy Skiss put it to him that he has  gone public because of bitterness over the way he had been  treated by his superiors.    [Begin recording] [Mark] That certainly is not true because  I  don't have to be bitter about it. I haven't said anything  personal against Abacha or any other person in the  administration. I have simply said we agreed on a program and  they should release that program and follow it religiously.    [Skiss] So do you think you were retired because you were  seen as an ally of General Babangida? You were one of  Babangida's boys.    [Mark] Far from that; so was Abacha, if there is anything  like that. Abacha was Babangida's right-hand man. But even if  that is the case, why can't this administration come up with a  timetable showing when they are going to hand over. They are  working on a constitutional conference; they are going to elect  people into that constitutional conference; they are going to  accommodate the elected members in the constitutional conference  in Abuja. They haven't built the houses in Abuja yet. You  don't build a house overnight. Those who are going to be elected  don't even know the format of the election yet and the  constitutional conference is going to be designed to stay some  time before they start. At the end of that constitutional  conference, we are going to have an election. There is no  program, so it is common sense to see the way it is going. It  doesn't take a genius to understand that.    [Skiss] The government has criticized the interview you gave  to NEWSWATCH in saying it's all part of a plot to destabilize  the Abacha government. Would you agree with that?    [Mark] Nobody wants to do Abacha government that favor. It  will be a favor to that administration to destabilize it.  Nobody wants to do them that favor. They should be honorable  enough to quit on their own. Nobody would like to do them that  favor.    [Skiss] Now, since you gave the interview the editor of  NEWSWATCH has been detained. What do you say to the Abacha  government: Release him immediately?    [Mark] Well, this is the beginning of dictatorship and that  is how dictators start. They start first by dealing with  journalists. They are their first victims. I have accepted and  I gave an interview. Nobody is challenging the contents of the  interview I have given. People are skirting round it. The  government is skirting round it. They haven't addressed one  single issue that I raised in my interview because those were  simple facts, the honest truth.    [Skiss] But the editor was arrested. Would you be willing to  go back to Nigeria and swap places with the editor?    [Mark] I am going back on the 30th of May because my program  here.... [pauses] I am going to finish what I have come to do by  the 30th and I've booked a flight to go back. I certainly would  not run away from Nigeria, I would be the last person to.    [Skiss] Some people would say that this interview is the  beginning of your political career; your military career is now  over; you are going to launch a political career. Is that right?    [Mark] I have no intention whatsoever of playing politics? I  don't have that intention.    [Skiss] But you played politics before?    [Mark] I haven't. I have never played politics.    [Skiss] Well, when Abacha took over, that is what I call  playing politics.    [Mark] Well, I am a patriotic Nigerian and I will go for  anything that will ensure the goodness of that country so if  what we did was barely to.... [pauses] I mean, was just to make  sure that we got the best for Nigeria, if you call that  politics, yes, but otherwise I have no desire whatsoever to go  into politics. [end recording]

text:  BFN     [From the "Focus on Africa" program]     [Text] And as if the situation in the war zone in Sierra  Leone was not confused enough, a new factor has emerged on the  side of the government forces battling the RUF [Revolutionary  United Front] rebels. Alhaji Koromah, whose ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in Liberia  has been torn by splits between him and another faction based in  Freetown, has now taken on the RUF as well as Nii Nartey Allison  reports in this telex from Monrovia.    It was confirmed here today that ULIMO is engaged in  fighting  inside Sierra Leone against Foday Sankoh's rebels. ULIMO leader  Alhaji Koromah said today that his forces, under the command of  Loseni Yamah, have set up a command post at the Sierra Leone  border and are advancing toward Kekema, 10 miles inside Sierra  Leone. This, said Koromah, was to open a security corridor so  that Liberian refugees in Kenema could return home. Koromah  said: It is a full- scale operation, and we have informed the  government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations of our battle  in Sierra Leone. But the situation remains confused, because  later today, the Lofa Defense Force, a new faction fighting  ULIMO for control of Liberia's northern Lofa County, said here  that their forces have successfully dislodged Koromah's units  and have secured control of the territory stretching from the  Saint Paul River Bridge bordering Lofa and Bong counties to the  Foya District on the Sierra Leone-Guinea access. They boasted in  a statement of being in control of the administrative seats of  Voinjama and the towns of Golu, Salaye, Zosa, and Konia.

text:  BFN     [Text] Kigali, April 12 (AFP) -- There was heavy shooting  Tuesday [12 April] morning in the Rwandan capital Kigali as  rebel forces neared the capital, and departing French troops  handed over the evacuation of foreigners to Belgium. The  shooting was concentrated in the southern Gikondo area,  according to Captain Eric Millet of the French Third Parachute  Regiment. The shooting, now coming from the north, had earlier  come in the east of the city where the rebel Rwandan Patriotic  Front (RPF) had a battalion of 600 men. "It is hard to tell if  the forces shooting from the north are RPF reinforcements  (advancing) from the position they held two days ago 15  kilometres (nine miles) away, or if the rebels in the east have  repositioned themselves," Millet added.    On Tuesday the French Embassy had completely closed down,  adding to the sense of panic among Rwandans trying to escape the  fighting. the troops, sent to help the now completed evacuation  of French nationals, said they would leave as soon as control  over the city's remaining foreign population had been handed  over to Belgian forces.    More than 1,000 people have been evacuated from Kigali by  air  to date, the French troops said. The remaining foreign  nationals, waiting at the French school, were to be brought to  the airport in a convoy. A group of about 50 Rwandans who had  sought refuge in the French embassy were brought to the airport  Tuesday morning in a convoy of trucks. Their breakfast plates  were still lying on the tables of the deserted embassy, whose  doors had been left open.    "Everyone has left," confirmed the branch chief of Kigali's  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Philippe  Gaillard, who had placed sand bags around the ICRC offices in  preparation for the fighting to come.

"Our forces are now within  eyeshot of the place where our 600-strong unit is," said  Christine Umutoni, spokeswoman for the Rwanda Patriotic Front  (RPF) office in Uganda.    She told AFP that RPF forces were not in a hurry to take  Kigali and would move slowly to avoid massive destruction of the  city.

"They are showing signs of wanting to stay around  and help this murderous regime," Umutoni said.    Some 500 French soldiers flew into Kigali over the weekend  to  ensure the safe evacuation of the 600-odd French citizens in  Rwanda. Umutoni complained the French troops were not leaving  although the rescue mission had been completed.

headline:    Kambanda: Government Ready To Respect Accords 
text:  BFN     [By Annie Thomas]     [Excerpts] Kigali, 12 Apr (AFP)--Rwanda's interim prime  minister said his government was ready to comply with  eight-month-old peace accords to end the ethnic warfare in the  country provided there was no "cheating." "We see no reason to  start negotiations from scratch," despite the fighting between  government forces and rebels from the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), Prime Minister Jean Kambanda told AFP late Monday [11  April]. "We want a truce that would allow us to open overall  negotiations on a ceasefire, then political negotiations," he  said.    The RPF has refused to recognize the interim government  which  it says has only members opposed to the rebels. Rebel  reinforcements Monday were reported to have advanced to the  outskirts of the city amid fresh fighting in the capital as UN  commanders tried to secure a truce between the two sides.    Kambanda said he saw no problem with provisions in the peace  accord signed last August in Arusha, Tanzania, that gave the RPF  five ministers and 11 deputies, saying he felt divisions among  political parties and "individual initiatives" of certain  leaders had prevented implementation of the accord. [passage  omitted]    Kambanda, a member of the main opposition group the  Democratic Republican Movement, said certain political leaders,  including ministers, had "tried to keep out members of their own  parties in favor of the RPF" in talks on the transition  government. "People's frustrations built up, and exploded in  the rage triggered by the death of the head of state," he said.    Kambanda said one of the obstacles to a truce to end the  latest bloodletting was the RPF's demand to negotiate directly  with the Army and not with the interim government.    The interim government, most of whose members are staying in  a hotel in the capital Kigali, also has "questions" about how  the 600 RPF troops who arrived in Kigali obtained heavy weapons,  he said. Kambanda said they were only to be armed under treaty  provisions with light weapons for their mission to ensure  protection of RPF leaders in the capital. One member of the  government said the RPF Monday destroyed an Army tank "with a  rocket they were not supposed to have."    Some Hutu politicians have viewed Belgium as pro-Tutsi, but  Kambanda has refused to join in their accusations that the UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda -- which includes Ghanaians and  Bangladeshi troops along with the Belgians -- did not correctly  monitor RPF troops or that Belgium supplied the rebels with  arms. [passage omitted]    Kambanda would not confirm reports that Habyarimana's plane  was shot down, but he said he had "just learned" that Rwandan  Army troops prevented UN soldiers from examining the plane and  he would "negotiate with the Army to resolve this problem."

headline:    RPF Calls Foreign Reports of Cease-Fire `Unfounded' 
text:  BFN     [Text] Recent foreign media broadcasts referring to a  cease-fire agreement between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  and the government are unfounded. The RPF cannot sign an  agreement with a government it does not recognize.    The so-called government is null and void politically and  legally. The clique calling itself a coalition of parties which  were part of the previous government actively comprises  individuals jointly motivated by a desire to divide Rwandans.  The government comprises the small group of people who fought  the Arusha agreement and did everything possible to ensure it  was scrapped.    The RPF cannot hold talks with the clique, which does not  recognize the Arusha agreements. As far as the RPF is  concerned, there is no government in Rwanda. It does not even  recognize the man who calls himself president of the Republic  after being installed unlawfully. He has said himself that he  was installed as president under Article 42 of the Constitution  of 10 February 1991. He says so himself. However, he well knows  that the article is no longer valid. The president of the  Republic had been sworn in under the peace agreement and was to  have been replaced in accordance with the same agreement. The  agreement stipulates that the president of the Republic is to be  replaced by the president of the transitional broad-based  National Assembly. Theodore Sindikubgabo is only president of  the National Development Counci [CND], which is now irrelevant.  His government cannot hold talks with the RPF. It is not a  government of Rwandans but a clique with Coalition for the  Defense of the Republic [CDR] ideas which conflict with the  Arusha agreements. It is a government that has not been  recognized by a single foreign country. Even international  radios call it the CDR.    [Words indistinct] the United Nations has not recognized it.  The so-called government cannot hold talks with the RPF, because  it has exterminated the government of Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana.    A close look shows that the government is made up of a  clique  which usurped power by shedding blood. What it did is no  different from a coup d'etat. It has been said on several  occasions that the clique wanted to replace the government with  another which would oppose the RPF. To install such a  government they first had to kill all their opponents in the  government, which they did.    What also exposes their plan was killing Felicien Ngango,  who  was to have become president of the broad-based National  Assembly and would therefore have replaced the president of the  Republic. They made it even clearer with the death of Joseph  Kavaruganda, the president of the Constitutional Court, who was  empowered to swear in the individual who would have replaced the  president of the Republic and his friends.    The clique had always nursed its plan of capturing power,  but  failed to obtain the ways and means to carry it out. They found  a way through the death of President Habyarimana, which the  clique must have paved the way for so as to bring to realization  the objectives of those who called themselves power. [as heard]  That is why some conclude that what was done was no different  from a coup d'etat, as there are killings causing tears. Over  10,000 have already died. The government is still cooperating  with the killers although it [words indistinct] part of its  program. That is why the RPF must fight the clique until  dictatorship and division are disposed of in Rwanda.    The RPF decided to resume fighting for three main reasons:  First, to support the RPF combatants in the CND compound, who  have been and continue being attacked by the Presidential Guard.  Second, to stop the killings of innocent people. Third, to  restore peace in the country.    The RPF continues to implement its goals. In fact, the RPF  has entered the outskirts of Kigali. It is fighting the  Presidential Guards and their supporters. That is why it asks  all citizens to support the RPF combatants [words indistinct]  and that if they see them they should know they are coming to  rout Rwanda's enemies.    We call on government soldiers who do not support the clique  to support the RPF combatants. The UN Assistance Mission to  Rwanda's contribution is also necessary. They should avoid the  clique's traps, especially by refraining from bringing the RPF  leaders messages from the clique. This is not a clique to hold  talks with, but one to be fought by all Rwandans. If we unite,  we shall get rid of it.

He  was cited in the international commission for human rights'  report during the Buguesera massacre.    How can you expect us to negotiate with people who are  behind  these killings? How can you negotiate with people who, over the  last two or three days, slaughtered more than 10,000 people? It  is beyond anything you can imagine. What they are doing now is  marching on Kigali as quickly as possible and trying to save  what can be saved. [end recording]

headline:    RPF Official Denies Reports of Leaders' Deaths 
text:  BFN     [Text] Kampala, 11 Apr (AFP) -- A Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF) spokeswoman in Uganda on Monday [11 April] refuted claims  by a Rwandan pro-Hutu extremist group that its chairman and  military commander had been killed. "The rumour is a work of  the CDR [Coalition for the Defence of the Republic] just to give  morale to the Rwandan Army...It is totally untrue, it is just a  work of a clique of people in Kigali who may be trying to  disorganise our camp, Christine Umutoni, a member of the  Political Bureau of the RPF, told AFP.    The radio of the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic  (CDR), a pro-Hutu extremist movement fiercely opposed to the  incorporation of the mainly Tutsi RPF in the Rwandan Government,  had earlier Monday reported that RPF commander Paul Kagame and  Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe had been killed in a power struggle  within the movement.    Umutoni said she had contacted the RPF High Command in  Rwanda  at 8.00 A.M (5.00 GMT) on Monday morning and was informed that  rebel forces were advancing towards the Rwandan capital and were  now at Kabuye, eight kilometers (five miles) from Kigali. She  could not tell when they will storm the capital where ethnic  warfare continues to rage since the death of the Rwandan  President Juvenal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart in a  suspect plane crash on Wednesday. "We have not encountered any  significant resistance on the battle front," Umutoni said.

headline:    Defense Ministry Urges Citizens To Fight RPF 
text:  BFN     [Communique issued by the Ministry of National Defense;   place and date not given]    [Text] After hearing the lies spread by Radio Muhabura, the  Ministry of National Defense informs Rwandans and the Rwandan  Armed Forces of the following:    1. All Rwandans, the entire Rwandan Armed Forces -- that is  the Army and the Gendarmerie -- are called upon not to believe  the lies broadcast by Radio Muhabura which are meant to divide  Rwandans and their Armed Forces.    2. Radio Muhabura is spreading lies saying that the Akazu  [Habyarimana, his relatives, and close friends] forces are  killing the Nduga [Hutus from the south] and other people whose  opinions differ from those of the Republican National Movement  for Democracy and Development and the Coalition for the Defense  of the Republic. The words are baseless and are only geared  towards dividing Rwandans into two. They are saying that some  are Kiga [Habyarimana's Hutu subclan] while others are Nduga so  that they do not unite and so that the enemy can take over the  country. The tricks of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have  been known to Rwandans for a long time.    3. Radio Muhabura is consistently lying that the soldiers  who guarded his excellency the president of the Republic started  the war and that other Army units stopped assisting them. This  lie is also not surprising since lying is one of the  characteristics of the RPF. Soldiers, gendarmes, and all  Rwandans have decided to fight their common enemy, who they have  all identified, together. The enemy is still the same. He is  the one who has always been trying to return the overthrown  monarch.    4. The Ministry of Defense calls on Rwandans, soldiers, and  gendarmes to do the following: Citizens are asked to act  together, to carry out patrols, and to fight the enemy.  Citizens are asked to support their Armed Forces by showing  them the location of the enemy. The Armed Forces are asked to  continue to carry out their duties by protecting our country and  its citizens. Rwandans and the Rwandan Armed Forces are called  upon not to listen to the lies of Radio Muhabura and other  radios which spread RPF news, as this is meant to divide  Rwandans and to cause fear. It is really sad to see how the  rebels are sending the youth to the war front, trying  unsuccessfully to fight a war they cannot win and believing that  they can capture the country. That is just a dream, as all  Rwandans are alert.

text:  BFN     [Text] Concerning the repatriation of the expatriate  community in Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the  UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR] today signed an  agreement to make the repatriation operations easier. Here is a  summary of the agreement in three points:    1. The beginning of hostilities between RPF combatants and  soldiers of the presidential guard led to some foreign countries  asking for their nationals to be evacuated from Rwanda.    2. The RPF commits itself to facilitating the evacuation  operation as long as the following conditions are respected:    A. The evacuation operation will last 48 hours as of  0700 on 12 April.  B. Foreign troops charged with carrying out the evacuation  operations will be organized in convoys and accompanied by  UNAMIR observers.  C. UNAMIR will inform the RPF, at least one hour  beforehand, of the distances to be covered and the itinerary to  be followed by the convoys, and also the approximate duration of  the various operations.  D. The RPF will authorize the passage of convoys under its  control and will stop fighting along the axes used by the same  convoys.  E. UNAMIR will verify that these RPF conditions are  respected and will report the slightest incident to the RPF in  the shortest possible time.    3. At the end of the evacuation of the expatriate  community, foreign troops who are not members of the UNAMIR will  have a period of 12 hours to leave the country. It is UNAMIR's  duty to inform the foreign troops deployed in Rwanda for  evacuation operations that they must respect the terms of the  agreement.    The agreement, whose contents have just been read, was  signed  between the RPF and UNAMIR today. Seth Sendashonga, youth and  culture minister in the broad-based transitional government  signed on behalf of the RPF and Major General Romeo Dallaire  signed on behalf of UNAMIR.

If all goes well, I will now have my  colleague Gui Polspoel on the line from Kigali. Gui, do you  hear me?    [Polspoel] I hear you loud and clear, Jan.    [Becaus] Where are you at this very moment, Gui?    [Polspoel] I am on the tarmac at the airport where we landed  some 10 minutes ago aboard a C-130 of the Belgian Air Force.    [Becaus] What is going on there?    [Polspoel] Mostly military movements. The C-130s are still  shuttling between Nairobi and Kigali, flying in military  equipment inlcuding trucks, jeeps, and so on, because only then  can the Belgians start their operation. The go-ahead for that  rests with the Rwandan authorities who thus far have not  permitted them to leave the airport. The French can leave, but  the Belgians must remain in place. Negotiations are continuing.    [Becaus] Can you judge from there how the evacuation is  proceeding?    [Polspoel] It is being carried out reasonably well, but  mainly with the French, who can pick up people in town. A  flight with 75 people onboard left for Nairobi, Kenya some 30  minutes ago. The passengers will be flown back from Nairobi to  Belgium probably on board two Belgian Air Force planes, actually  passenger planes, which are waiting at Nairobi airport. Most of  those 75 are Belgians, but we do not have the exact information  on their identities.    [Becaus] If I understand it well, Gui, the Belgian military  is still inactive at this very moment?    [Polspoel] Yes, that is correct. Obviously they are helping  the refugees arriving at the airport, but they have not been  permitted real operations in the town or outside the airport yet.    [Becaus] Can you hear, from where you are, hostilities in or  around Kigali?    [Polspoel] No. Last night, however, the Air Force people  told us that when they left here around 1800, there was heavy  shooting in this neighborhood.    [Becaus] Well, thanks Gui Polspoel. We will certainly hear  from you later in our next newscast.

headline:    Belgian Evacuation Continues 
text:  BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] About 250 Belgian citizens left  Kigali for Nairobi in Kenya today on board Hercules C-130  aircraft of the Belgian Air Force. So the operation to evacuate  Belgians from Rwanda -- there are about 1,500 of them -- really  has started, although fighting continues in the capital of  Rwanda between the regular army and the troops of the Rwandan  Patriotic Front. Francois Riquemont, our special correspondent  in Rwanda, has just arrived in Kigali, and here are his first  impressions:    [Begin recording] [Riquemont] The first Belgian refugees  left  Kigali Airport early this afternoon for Nairobi. There must be  about 250 of them who have already left Rwanda. In general the  people arriving here are very calm, even if they have been  through a lot in the last few days in the town. They are calm,  and everything is going peacefully and without panic. People  are saying that as soon as the French paratroops and then the  Belgians arrived they felt much safer, even if many of them were  threatened and had to take refuge in somewhat safer places  before leaving for the airport in convoy.    [Unidentified correspondent] So how are the convoys going?    [Riquemont] It is known that the Belgians have in a way been  caught in a trap. They were unable to leave by road, since the  Belgian convoy was forced to turn back, and the Belgians in the  convoys of foreigners were made to get out of the cars and they  were stopped from getting through. So in the end convoys were  arranged under very strong escort. There have been no incidents  with these Belgian convoys, except for one, where there were  serious threats, and stones were thrown, but nothing very  serious. I must also tell you that the people we have spoken to  here are worried about leaving, and also worried about the  Rwandans they know and about the future, what they expect their  future to be.    [Correspondent] Do you have any idea about the scale of the  fighting that has and is taking place in Kigali?    [Riquemont] There is total anarchy in the town. We haven't  been able to get into the town ourselves, but we have had many  very reliable and consistent accounts. There is anarchy. There  is still serious fighting, even if it is sporadic, between the  Rwandan Army, the regular army, especially the Presidential  Guard, and the rebels, or former rebels, of the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF]. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] On the subject of the RPF troops, is it just  rumor that they are close to the capital, Kigali, or is this  well grounded information?    [Riquemont] They are close to Kigali. We don't know how far.  From what we have been told, they are waiting before entering  the town. [end recording]    That was Francois Riquemont, with whom we spoke by telephone  just before this program.

headline:    French Envoy on Political Situation, Evacuation Work 
text:  BFN     [Interview with Jean-Michel Marlaud, French ambassador to   Rwanda, by Christophe Boisbouvier in Kigali on 11 April --  recorded]    [Text] [Marlaud] We have evacuated 617 expatriates so far.  This is last night's figure. Another 89 were evacuated this  morning, and a third convoy is on its way to the airport.    [Boisbouvier] Are these expatriates of different  nationalities?    [Marlaud] They are of different nationalities. Of course,  most of them are French nationals, but there are also Belgians,  Canadians, nationals from Oman, Indians, nationals from  Mauritius, several nationalities including, of course, nationals  from almost all European Union countries such as Greeks and  Germans, a wide- ranging number of nationalities.    [Boisbouvier] What about the numerous Belgians who are still  here?    [Marlaud] The Belgians have now arrived in Kigali. As far as  we are concerned, we will continue to include Belgian nationals  in our evacuation plan. There is a significant number of  Belgian nationals in the convoy which is on its way to the  airport. I believe that the Belgians who are arriving will  gradually take care of their own nationals.    [Boisbouvier] Will any French nationals be left in Rwanda  after the evacuations?    [Marlaud] There is a number of French nationals who, if need  be, could decide to stay in Rwanda although the Foreign Ministry  has strongly encouraged our nationals to leave this country, but  we cannot compel those who do not want to leave to do so.    [Boisbouvier] Have you got an example?    [Marlaud] There are a number of priests and nuns who  sometimes refuse to be evacuated despite our advice and despite  the help we are ready to give them. Moreover, the embassy  remains open for the time being.    [Boisbouvier] Do you intend to evacuate all diplomatic staff  at the end of the evacuation operation?    [Marlaud] The embassy is open for the time being. As long as  no other decision is made, it will remain open.    [Boisbouvier] What is the mission of the French force in  Kigali now? Is it only to carry out the evacuation, or is it  also to maintain order at the airport and in other sensitive  zones?    [Marlaud] The mission of the French forces is to ensure the  safety of French nationals and other nationals who wish to leave  Rwanda.    [Boisbouviere] Nothing else?    [Marlaud] This is the mission that was given to them. I  believe that this was said in Paris quite clearly.    [Boisbouvier] Did many French nationals die?    [Marlaud] Well, apart from the crew of the presidential  plane, one death has been confirmed.    [Boisbouvier] That of a white father in southern Rwanda?    [Marlaud] Yes, but please allow me not to give too many  details because I am always wary of the closest relatives  hearing about it before they have been told directly. I would  rather not elaborate.    [Boisbouvier] There has been talk of a cease-fire in the  country between the government and the Rwanda Patriotic Front  [RPF] rebels, for 24 hours. What is the situation this Monday  at noon?    [Marlaud] There are still on-going talks between the  government and the RPF. The UN Mission in Rwanda is acting as a  go-between. No agreement on a cease-fire has been reached so far.    [Boisbouvier] Do you think that it will be possible to reach  an agreement over the next few hours, given the conditions  demanded by the two sides?    [Marlaud] The Rwandan government called for a cease-fire  right away. So far, the RPF has rejected it. It remains to be  seen whether the RPF will finally agree to this cease-fire  throughout the country.    [Boisbouvier] The Rwandan government, which was appointed a  few days ago, has been denounced by some as a government with a  hard line against the RPF. What do you think about that?    [Marlaud] As far as the replacement of President Habyarimana  is concerned, the new interim head of state is the former  speaker of the National Assembly. This is in keeping with the  provisions of the former Rwandan constitution and with the  provisions of the Arusha agreement. The sharing out of  ministries and ministerial posts between the political parties  has remained the same as it was as far as the sharing out of  power provided for by the Arusha agreements is concerned. As  for the political balance of power within this government,  everybody can judge it differently.    [Boisbouvier] If there is a cease-fire tomorrow, do you  think  that a political agreement in the spirit of the Arusha  agreements is still possible after all that has happened over  the last few days?    [Marlaud] What is certain is that there is no solution to  Rwanda's problems if there is no reconciliation, if people are  not able to work and live together. The Arusha agreements were  an effort in that direction and it is the only way out of the  Rwandan crisis.

headline:    Kigali Embassy Closed 
text:  BFN     [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France closed its embassy  in the Rwandan capital Kigali Tuesday [12 April] as hundreds of  foreigners fleeing tribal warfare in the central African nation  arrived in France, officials said.    A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Ambassador  Jean-Michel Marlaud had left Kigali and was on his way to  Bangui, Central Africa.    The ministry said the ambassador had been asked to close the  embassy in Kigali, given the "deterioration of the situation" in  Rwanda.    French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin meanwhile met 474  French, German and American evacuees from Kigali at Paris'  Roissy airport early Tuesday.    Those on board the Air France Boeing 747, which arrived via  Nairobi, included the Marlaud's wife and Jean-Yves Pare, French  commercial attache in Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi.    Pare said the French embassy's archives in Kigali had been  totally destroyed during the violence between the country's  majority Hutus and minority Tutsis.    "I have lived through the longest five days of my life in  Kigali," Pare said. "Shots were coming from every direction.  Overnight Thursday, my house was hit twice by gunfire."    The Belgian Defence Ministry also announced Tuesday that  nearly 400 evacuees, mainly Belgians, had arrived at Brussels  airport Tuesday from Nairobi.    They were flown in on two planes, one carrying 195 people --  186 Belgians and nine people of other nationalities and another  carrying 204 people, 158 of them Belgian.    It said a total of 446 Belgians had fled Rwanda, a former  Belgian colony, and about 1,000 others remained behind. It was  impossible to know how many of those wanted to be evacuated, the  ministry said.    Late Monday French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said all but  a "very small number" of French nationals had left Rwanda.    A ministry spokesman said Tuesday that "a very small number  of French nationals had chosen to remain in Rwanda." They were  mainly priests and nuns.    Earlier on Tuesday, 205 evacuees from Rwanda, including 94  Rwandan orphans, were also flown into Roissy on a French  airforce Airbus.    According to the Belgian Defence Ministry, the Belgian  evacuation operation, being conducted by Belgian troops, should  be completed within three or four days. Belgians made up the  largest group of foreign nationals in Rwanda, with more than  1,500 living there.    Another flight from Nairobi, carrying 400 people, was  expected in Brussels early Tuesday afternoon.    In Paris, meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry said two flights  from Bangui were expected later Tuesday carrying about 55 French  nationals and 30 people of other nationalities.

text:  BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 9 Apr (AFP) -- Zairean television reported  today that the constitutional act to govern institutions in  Zaire for the 15-month transitional period leading to the Third  Republic was promulgated yesterday by the head of state, Marshal  Mobutu Sese Seko. The act was formally adopted on 8 April  during the closing ceremony of the extraordinary session of the  High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT).  The act had been the subject of a heated debate between the  presidential and opposition groups, concerning the method for  appointing the prime minister during the transition period.    This act essentially defines the relationship between the  government and the president of the Republic, and gives the  HCR-PT the power to check on government actions. It fixes the  duration of the transitional period at 15 months, during which a  constitutional referendum and presidential and legislative  elections are to be organized. According to the act, the powers  of the government have been strengthened, whereby they receive  effective control of the Central Bank and the security forces.  The head of state, who remains supreme commander of the Army,  has had his powers reduced, especially when it comes to  appointing high-ranking civil servants. Such appointments  henceforth are made "at the government's proposal."    The prime minister is presented by the political group to  which the head of state does not belong, after consultations  with the political class. The political class is given a 10-day  grace period within which to make this appointment. After this  period, the HCR-PT is expected to take the matter up and find  the ways and means to resolve the issue.

This announcement was made  during the closing ceremony of the extraordinary session of  parliament in the presence of the diplomatic corps. The two  political groups, comprising pro-Mobutu and anti-Mobutu  movements, will have 10 days, from the day the head of state  promulgates the constitutional act, to appoint a prime minister.    According to the prelate, quoting the transition  constitutional act, the appointment by the head of state will  then only be an official recognition of this appointment, and at  the end of the process the HCR-PT will endorse the prime  minister, its government, and its program. "It is now up to  politicians to accord their tune very well. If they need the  mediation of the standing committee of the HCR-PT, the committee  will take care of that, but it is not the parliament's duty to  interfere in the internal affairs of political groups,"  Monsignor Monsengwo stated.    The extraordinary session of the HCR-PT is expected to form  a  new standing committee of the HCR, which will include former  National Assembly members, to amend the act on constitutional  provisions concerning the transition period, and to draw  standing orders from the transition parliament.

The HCR-PT on 31 March adopted a new "constitutional act,"  which is supposed to govern the democratic transitional period  in Zaire toward a Third Republic. On 8 April, Monsignor  Monsengwo announced that an agreement was reached on the  procedure for the appointment of a future prime minister.

When we talk of elections, we are assuming there will be peace  in Angola. Afterward, can the elections be held. [end recording]    Paradoxically in Angola, the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party has intensified its air raids  against civilian targets.    [Begin Valentim recording] However, while we are preparing  peace in Lusaka, very alarming reports from Huambo say that  yesterday as of 1000 [0900 GMT] there were massive air raids  against the city of Huambo, in which dozens of people died and a  number of houses were completely destroyed. The government  aircraft dropped every kind of bomb on Huambo residents. We  believe that this intensification of war in Angola does not meet  the wishes of the Angolan people or the expectations of the  international community.    The UNITA delegation once more reiterates that it is willing  to continue with the talks. It will remain in Lusaka, but it  appeals to the international community, the UN Security Council,  and observer countries to firmly condemn this intensification of  war and the government's air raids.

This has been diclosed by  Conde [as heard], assistant to UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye. That UN official also said that there is no  danger that the talks might collapse. He expressed concern,  however, about continuing military clashes in general, and in  particular about bombardments by the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola- Labor Party, MPLA-PT air force against  cities controlled by the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola, UNITA.    It is noteworthy that the team led by Faustino Muteka, which  surprisingly left the Zambian capital last week, has now been  back in Lusaka since yesterday. When the Angolan peace talks  resume tomorrow, they will be focusing on the issue of the  second round of presidential elections. This has been disclosed  by a UN source quoted by the Portuguese Broadcasting  Corporation, RDP.    Meanwhile, UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim  has  said today that the second round of presidential elections will  depend on three indispensable factors of a material,  psychological, and political nature. He noted that the second  round of presidential elections will be held when the country  has achieved stability and the administrative sector is ready to  provide equal service to all people, irrespective of where they  may live or the party they support. It is necessary that the  people experience security so that all political parties can go  openly about their political work.    For the second round of presidential elections, UNITA is  demanding that the former National Electoral Council, CNE, be  scrapped. UNITA has also demanded parity with the government in  the future CNE.

The representation budgets of the prime minister and of  the president of the Republic have no fixed limits; the Finance  Ministry ascribes a sum in accordance with the average expenses  of previous years.    Ministers: 2,500 contos (there are tax deductions), plus 800  contos for representation expenses, protocol vehicle (a Mercedes  Benz), personal vehicle with minimum 1,800 cc horsepower (to be  paid in installments over five years), a driver (who is an  employee of the relevant ministry) and an aide (who is a police  officer).

headline:    Commentary: High Subsidies To Ravage State Budget 
text:  BFN     [Editorial comment: "Cyclone Nadia for the General State   Budget"]    [Excerpt] (Maputo) The Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] has been preaching to the government because of the  skeletal budget that has been awarded the university but, then,  it goes along with a proposal for high subsidies for members of  the National Elections Commission, CNE. In other words, a CNE  member earns more money in two months than the amount that has  been budgeted for the running of the Faculty of Economy.    The unarmed opposition has often accused the government of a  lack of clarity and austerity in public spending. They are  quite right. However, so far none of the three members who  represent the unarmed opposition in the CNE appears to have come  forward to protest this proposal for such high subsidies and  benefits.    This CNE proposal is ideal for the Mozambique Liberation  Front [Frelimo], which has 10 members in the CNE. Those 10  people will be earning fabulous salaries -- particularly by  comparison with the minimum wage -- and Joaquim Chissano can now  start saying: "look, Frelimo costs so much but the opposition,  if it wins the upcoming elections, will cost three times as  much."    It looks, therefore, like the CNE and its appetites may yet  be the Cyclone Nadia that the General State Budget needed to  become as ravaged as Nampula Province. [passage omitted]

"We will return only when the  peace situation has improved," said Ms Marie Potgieter of Louis  Trichardt, in the northern Transvaal. Ms Potgieter, who had set  up a tent in Harare's Coronation Park camp site said: "Life is  more important than the franchise."

Zimbabwean homes are also filling up as South African  relatives and friends arrive. "I've got five families with me.

headline:    Security Minister Calls For International Assistance 
text:  BFN     [Interview with Security Minister Leonard Nyangoma by Rupert   Neudeck in Germany; date not given -- recorded, in French with  superimposed German translation]    [Text] [Announcer Wolfgang Labuhn] After the complete  collapse of the state order in Rwanda in eastern Africa, fear of  similar developments is also growing in neighboring Burundi,  because in Burundi, too, there is a century-old conflict between  the tribes of the Hutu and the Tutsi. In contrast to Rwanda, in  Burundi it is still the Tutsi minority that rules the Hutu  majority and relies on the army, which is exclusively composed  of Tutsis. On the weekend, the Tutsi Army began to search  Hutus, who had been crammed into a stadium, for weapons, after  the armed forces had attacked the district of Kamenge, which is  inhabited by Hutus, in the capital city of Bujumbura.    This was a reason for my colleague Rupert Neudeck asking  Leonard Nyangoma, security minister of Burundi, about the  situation in Kamenge during his visit to Germany.    [Nyangoma] Since late afternoon of 28 April the Burundi  Army,  which consists exclusively of Tutsis, has started to bomb the  district of Kamenge in Bujumbura. This attack was carried out  with the heaviest weapons, that is, with artillery and grenades;  it is even said that Stalin organs were used. However, no  matter how this attack was carried out, it is quite clear that  the Hutu inhabitants of Kamenge are now victims of these attacks.    [Neudeck] Are there already figures about the victims, the  dead, and the destruction in Kamenge?    [Nyangoma] We do not yet have any exact figures, but I have  already been told that the number of dead is reportedly very  high. However, we have received reports that the Burundi Army  allegedly massacred about 2,000 people in the hills around the  capital city. Casualties in Kamenge must be very high, because  the Hutu people there are surrounded by the army, they cannot  flee anywhere, they have no protection at all.    [Neudeck] How can you explain this complicated situation to  the German public?    [Nyangoma] On 21 October 1993 there was the attempt to carry  out a coup d'etat, when the then president and his associates  were killed. The consequences are known. Internal ethnic  fighting flared again in Burundi. There also was heavy material  damage. Currently, we are again facing an imminent coup d'etat.  Nowadays the excuse used by the Burundi Army for torturing and  attacking the population is that the population must be disarmed.    We, the Government, basically agree with disarming the  population. However, there remains the question of who is  disarming whom. To the extent to which the Tutsi army has again  and again issued arms to its Tutsi compatriots since 1972, it  has completely given away the legitimation for disarming the  population, particularly, now, exclusively the Hutu population.    Therefore, the disarming, which is carried out now under  these conditions, is rejected by the people. It should be  carried out only by the international community.    There is a group of extremist Tutsis among the people that  does not want to accept the process of democratization in  Burundi. This group wants to guarantee the status quo. This  group enjoys so many privileges that it does not want to agree  to this process. They think that the process of transparent  democratization in Burundi will not leave them with their  privileges. This, however, is wrong, because since  democratization began in June 1993, no property rights --  neither of Hutus nor of Tutsis -- have been touched upon. This  group of extremist Tutsis wants to stop democratization, because  it is worried about its privileges.    [Neudeck] Mr. Minister, what do you ask of the German  Government and of the German people in this serious situation?    [Nyangoma] The people of our country are in a difficult  situation. Even the new institutions of democracy have been  taken hostage by the army. Since 21 October 1993, we have lived  like hostages. Unfortunately, our crisis in Burundi is not  really known abroad. The international community does not even  really see it. Germany, in particular, however, should know  about our crisis. I think that particularly Germany, as a  democratic country, should now react to our crisis. Germany  should alert the international community so that the people in  Burundi are helped in this extremely tense situation so as to,  in particular, solve the problem of this terrible coexistence of  an army in Burundi that is not neutral and the threatened  population. We are appealing to the international community to  help us organize a round table or a conference that might help  with reestablishing peace and security in this region.    [Neudeck] In what framework do you envisage a solution for  your country?    [Nyangoma] I believe that the solution should be tackled  bilaterally as well as multilaterally. An international  conference should be convened, with the particular participation  of our neighboring states, that is, Tanzania, Zambia, and Kenya,  but also with the help of those countries, which have long been  friends with Burundi. I am particularly thinking of Belgium,  France, and the United States. Of course, we also need the  support of the United Nations very much, just as of the  Organization of African Unity.

The mass  flight came amid continued fighting between government and  rebels forces, particularly in southern Rwanda, including a  reported massacre when police opened fire with machine guns on  refugees trying to flee a stadium.    A UN High Commissioner for Refugees statement said that  250,000 people had sought refuge in Tanzania in a 24-hour  period, many of them speaking of a worsening military situation  in southern Rwanda. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile a UNHCR statement said Rwandan police and  militiamen had opened fire Friday with machine guns and grenades  on 5,000 refugees trying to flee from a stadium where they were  being held, killing an unknown number. It said the attack  happened at a stadium in Cyangugu, southwestern Rwandan, where  the refugees initially sought shelter in the wake of widespread  ethnic unrest which erupted at the start of April. The  statement said an unknown number of people were killed and  injured in Friday's attack, adding that local authorities had  prevented aid agencies from visiting the area, and the refugees  from leaving the stadium.    World Food Programme spokesman Francis Mwanza meanwhile said  that about 320,000 Rwandans had reached Ngara, in north-western  Tanzania, in the past few days, amid the general exodus.    An official of the UN humanitarian department, Lance Clarke,  meanwhile said fighting had prevented aid experts from reaching  southern Rwanda, controlled by government forces. Clarke told a  news conference here that Rwanda faced a "humanitarian  disaster." A UNHCR spokesman attributed the mass exodus to a  "worsening of the situation" in southern Rwanda.    The rebels seemed to be tightening their grip on Kigali  while  the government forces lacked direction from their leaders, an  international official in the capital said. The capital could  fall to the rebels "very shortly," said the official, who  requested anonymity.    Meanwhile in neighbouring Burundi, which has largely avoided  the carnage sparked by the deaths of both countries' presidents  on April 6, at least three people were killed as security forces  tried to disarm militiamen. A soldier and two civilians were  killed overnight, a military spokesman said in the capital  Bujumbura.    In Brussels, the European Commission said it was sending a  total of 1.13 million ECU's (1.3 million dollars) worth of  humanitarian aid to help some 100,000 Rwandan refugees who have  poured into Tanzania in recent days.    In a related development Belgium said it was barring members  of Rwanda's interim government until it received a retraction of  allegations that Belgian troops were involved the April 6  downing of the president's plane.

The latest and horrifying  incident took place yesterday [29 April] in Cyangugu, where  about 300 people were killed. These were among the 5,000 people  who had taken refuge in the stadium. The murderers threw  several hand grenades at the refugees and used machine guns in  heavy fire to kill the innocent people. The ICRC is making  arrangements to help the rest of the people escape to Bukavu, in  Zaire.    Meanwhile, a ceremony to hand over Burundi refugees took  place at Mulindi yesterday. The Burundi refugees, who numbered  about 20, had been rescued by RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]  troops from Kigali passing through Byumba to Mulindi. They were  handed over to the Burundi ambassador in Uganda and were taken  to Kampala [passage omitted]    In a [word indistinct] incident, thousands of refugees and  displaced people flocked to Byumba town, controlled by the RPF.  All these people had come from Commune Rutongo near Kigali.  The worst thing to note about these people was that they had  all lost their families. [passage omitted] To the relief of the  refugees in Byumba, the Red Cross brought in several tons of  food and cooking oil and the RPF medical personnel were doing  their best to treat the wounded. Meanwhile, foreign journalists  continue to visit areas under RPF control. Today, they visited  (Kami) Barracks near Kigali, which is completely under the  control of the RPF.

text:  BFN     [Text] Nairobi, May 2 (AFP) -- Twelve people have been  killed and 113 wounded in a Kigali church by mortar fire,  according to a statement issued by the UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda and made available here Monday [2 May].    Two shells hit the Sainte-Famille Church in downtown Kigali  Sunday where more than 2,000 people fleeing the fighting between  government forces and Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels had found  shelter. The UN mission said it could not determine the origin  of the fire.    UN special envoy Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said the latest  attack again targeted civilians who were "innocent victims of a  war they do not want." He urged the warring parties not to  attack civilians.    Within the last two weeks shells have also hit the Roi  Faycal  hospital and the Amahoro de Kigali stadium, killing more than 60  people.    More than 12,000 people mostly Tutsis, fleeing massacres  perpetrated by the armed forces and Hutu militias, have found  shelter in these two facilities under UN protection.

headline:    RPF Leader Says Fate of Kigali To Be Settled Soon 
text:  BFN     [Excerpts] After the death of President Habyarimana in a  plane accident on 6 April, the clique in power in Kigali  implemented a plan to systematically exterminate all Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development members and  sympathizers, the sole party in power in our country for the  last 20 years. The carnage was intended to result in the deaths  of all those who do not hold the same views as the dictatorial  clique. The death of President Habyarimana served as a pretext  to launch organized massacres. Today, three weeks after the  incident, more than 200,000 have fallen victim to these  unprecedented barbaric acts, which still continue. To kill so  many people in such a short time is a record in the history of  organized massacres.    Following the tragedy that our country has and is still  experiencing, our foreign media colleagues came to cover the sad  events. But they often come with their pre-conceived ideas, one  such being that the Rwandan problem is an ethnic one. The  dictatorial power has always orchestrated a disinformation  campaign, intended to make people believe that the Rwandan  problem is an ethnic one between the Hutu and Tutsi.  Fortunately, Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] officials have  consistently taken every opportunity to explain the reality of  the situation to the international community. That is why, on  22 April, RPF President Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, during a  visit to Kibungo Prefecture in eastern Rwanda -- a prefecture  totally under the control of the RPF, just like Byumba -- met  with and was interviewed by foreign journalists who were  visiting the disaster-hit region. I invite you to listen to  this interview, however, first I would like to inform you that  the questions were put forward through an interpreter. Colonel  Kanyarengwe began by recalling and confirming that the Rwandan  problem is a political one, which requires a political solution.  [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr.  President,  in case the peace negotiations fail, will the RPF be able to  capture Kigali? If that happens, what are your plans?    [Kanyarengwe] Concerning the negotiations, we think that the  Arusha negotiations are sufficient, since they constitute a  document which was the outcome of a long period of discussions  and compromise between the RPF and the government. We may have  to adjust the terms of the Arusha Accord. Otherwise, that  agreement is enough for us. In view of the pace of events, for  the time being we are taking precautions before entering Kigali.  But we think that, taking into account the pressure which is  being placed on the capital, things will be sorted out over the  next few days. I cannot tell you the hour or day, but we are  sure that over the next few days the fate of Kigali will be  settled. As to the arrangement of an administration after  Kigali falls, that is a question that we will discuss with  survivors of those other opposition parties which were in  existence before this episode began.

headline:    RPF Urges Refugees To Return From Tanzania 
text:  BFN     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] asks Rwandan  refugees currently fleeing to Tanzania to return voluntarily to  their country. At a time when there is little security, mainly  due to the massacres being carried out by certain government  forces, with the assistance of the Interahamwe, [Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development militia] able  survivors are fleeing. There are also around 6,000 others who  are threatened by the Interahamwe and government forces in [word  indistinct] and churches in Kigali.    It is the same in foreign countries. A large number of  Rwandan refugees are fleeing. Among them are those attempting  to flee to Tanzania. Since 27 April, around 500,000 refugees  have arrived in Tanzania's Ngara region. Reports say that some  of the refugees are faced with disease, while others have wounds  caused by the Interahamwe and government forces. The refugees  arriving in Tanzania are made up of various groups. The first  group is made up of Rwandans who fled their homes because of the  killings and insecurity caused by the Interahamwe in Kibungo.  Another group is made up of the Interahamwe, including the  Murambi burgomaster, [words indistinct] who carried out the plan  for the massacres which failed later on. When the RPF troops  arrived in the area, the Interahamwe and other killers,  including government forces, due to the wicked things they had  done to the innocent, decided to flee. They realized they could  not fight RPF troops who were prepared to rescue innocent people  in the area. The third group of refugees in Tanzania is made up  of those who fled the fighting between the RPF troops and the  government forces elsewhere in the country, before fleeing the  area around Kibungo. The fourth category is that of Rwandans  who were staying in Kibungo, who felt insecure following the  deterioration of security caused by the divisionistic propaganda  of RTLM [Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines] and Radio  Kigali [words indistinct].    The RPF, once again, informs the international community and  Rwandans that it is the fundamental right of those refugees  currently in Tanzania to return to their country. There is no  problem at all between the RPF and the refugees. The best  indication of this is that there are people who are still in  their homes and who are living in harmony with the RPF troops in  Kibungo. Those who are sick following injuries caused by the  Interahamwe are being treated and are improving. Foreign  journalists are in the area to witness it. The RPF denies  unfounded reports to the effect that it might be stopping people  from fleeing and has closed the border with Tanzania. The UNHCR  [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] itself earlier announced  that about 500,000 refugees from Rwanda had fled to Tanzania  since 27 April. Then, how can those who claim the RPF is closing  borders justify that? As you heard, people are still crossing  the border to Tanzania. Currently, instead of being a real  facilitator, Tanzania has started to (?assist) the enemy of  Rwanda. After Habyarimana's death, Tanzania closed its border  to stop people from fleeing from the Interahamwe. Among the  people that country allowed in are many of the killers who fled.  When they fled, Tanzania opened the border.    The other sad thing for Rwandans and the international  community who were involved in the Arusha talks is that Tanzania  [words indistinct] Mwanza, Tanzania, seriously mistreated  Rwandan refugees in the area, claiming that they had celebrated  Habyarimana's death. Every person has the right to show  happiness or sorrow. There is always a reason for that.  Tanzania, which acted against the Rwandan refugees in Mwanza,  did not say anything when, in October 1990, the late  Habyarimana's government declared a 30-day celebration over the  death of the late RPF leader Rwigyema. One should ask the  Tanzanian officials whether those who celebrated in Mwanza acted  against any of the country's laws. This is yet another  injustice against Rwandans.    Tanzania should be a truly neutral facilitator and should  openly declare that it supports Rwandans and the international  community to [word indistinct] the killers, instead of  protecting them and turning a blind eye to the wrongdoings of  the clique. The RPF committed itself to joining hands with  Rwandans [words indistinct] those outside Rwanda, such as those  in Tanzania and other countries, to return home soon so as to  act together for the liberation of Rwanda.

headline:    Denies Thousands Stranded at Border 
text:  BFN     [Excerpts] The report by the UN High Commission for  Refugees [UNHCR] that the Rwandan Patriotic Army has blocked the  Rwanda border with Tanzania is baseless and absurd. The UNHCR  has reported that thousands of people trying to escape to  Tanzania are stranded on the Rwandan side of the border with  Tanzania because the Rwandan Patriotic Army has closed the  Rwanda-Tanzanian border at Rusomo. The Rwandan Patriotic Army  has not closed the border and contrary to these reports, more  than 500,000 people have crossed into Tanzania through the  border point at Rusomo within the last three days. [passage  omitted]    As for now, there are no people whatsoever at the Rwandan  side of the border trying to cross into Tanzania. On the  contrary, a number of people who had crossed into Tanzania are  now trying to return home, for the massacres have been stopped  since the arrival of the Rwandan Patriotic Army forces in this  area. [passage omitted] The UNHCR could have been fed with  fabricated and false information by people with ulterior  motives. These could be the same people who had earlier blocked  the entry points into Tanzania, blocking the refugees who were  running away from the massacres committed by the Rwandan  Government forces and this made the refugees easy prey for the  Army and the armed government-controlled militia.

headline:    RPF Chairman Condemns Lack of International Action 
text:  BFN     [Communique issued by RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe in   Mulindi on 30 April]    [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] informs national  and international public opinion about the following points:    First, a human tragedy of unprecedented scale is currently  taking place in Rwanda, openly and publicly witnessed by the  entire international community. This tragedy has now truly  become an act of genocide and a crime against humanity,  perpetrated by a clique of extremist individuals and a faction  of the government army. In less than three weeks -- since 6  April -- the clique has decimated the democratic opposition and  orchestrated the massacre of more than 200,000 people of all  ethnic groups.    Second, these massacres are part of an extermination plan  prepared long ago by high-ranking officials from the dictatorial  regime of the late President Habyarimana. To this end, arms,  ammunition, military training, and all sorts of preparations  were given to Habyarimana's party, the Republican National  Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense  of the Republic militias backed by the Presidential Guard. The  fact that a plan for political extermination was being prepared  was exposed long before the signing of the Arusha agreement, by  various sources inside and outside the country.    Third, negotiations for a peace agreement are used by this  clique of extremists as diversionary movements, the aim of which  are to gain enough time to finalize this extermination plan  which includes, for example, organizing militias, setting up a  propaganda radio station, and deploying agents of violence  throughout the entire country.    At the same time, the clique has done everything possible to  prevent the implementation of these very peace agreements. All  these diversionary moves were monitored closely by the  international community.    Fourth, given the shock expressed by this same international  community towards the horrors committed since the beginning of  the Rwandan conflict and during the entire Arusha peace talks.  The RPF was somehow expecting that, in the face of the ongoing  massacres, the international community assumed all its  responsibilities to contribute to end them by unreservedly  condemning all these criminal acts, providing all necessary  humanitarian aid to those in danger, and by refusing both  political and diplomatic support to these murderers who are  attempting to place themselves in power in Kigali.    Fifth, these criminals were so far condemned only by a few  governments and international and humanitarian organizations.  Many others continue to hide behind diplomatic silence and a  general lack of concern, while large-scale genocide and crimes  against humanity take place in front of their very eyes. What  is even worse, the French Government, received at the highest  level, a delegation of these criminals, which supports their  extermination policy and inhumane acts.    Sixth, the RPF:    a. Reminds the international community of its full  responsibility in the face of the genocide and crimes against  humanity being committed in Rwanda in front of its very eyes.    b. Condemns all forms of relations that may give this group  of murderers backing to its extermination policy and an  opportunity to strengthen its political and diplomatic position.    c. Urges the international community to isolate this clique  of criminals by refusing to hold any form of dialogue with it,  and not to give any form of political support and advice to this  clique.    d. Refuses to yield to the murderous blackmail of a clique  of  criminals that has established as a method of governance the  massacre of people, the taking of hostages and the assassination  of the democratic opposition.    e. Thanks governments and international organizations, as  well as all well-wishers who denounce the clique of the  murderers and help people in danger.    Issued, Mulindi, 30 April.    Signed, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, RPF chairman.

headline:    Criticizes French Government 
text:  BFN     [Statement issued by the RPF in Mulindi on 30 April]     [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, brings to the  notice of the press and the international community at large the  following:    1. That the massacres currently going on in Rwanda are  designed to exterminate a certain section of the population of  this country. The massacres are carried out by a clique of  murderers constituted of extreme groups like the Presidential  Guard, the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic], MRND  [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development]  militias and some elements in the government army. In less than  three weeks, since the accident of the 6th April 1994, the  murderous clique has killed more than 200,000 people of  different ethnic groups.    2. That the massacres have been long planned by the  high-ranking government officials of the then Habyarimana  government, the training and arming of CDR and MRND militias  were clear signs of the plan. This plan was known by people  inside and outside the country even before the signing of the  Arusha peace agreement.    3. That during the Arusha peace negotiations the extremist  clique was busy [words indistinct] confusing innocent citizens  as the murderous group was busy planning activities, including  the restoration of radio [word indistinct] for propaganda  purposes. At the same time, the group was making it impossible  for the setting up of the broad-based transitional institutions  (?agreed on under) the Arusha agreement.    4. The RPF appeals to all countries that have been following  and are assisting to carry out the Arusha peace negotiations to  condemn openly and without reservations the massacres in Rwanda  and to refrain from giving any attention or assistance to the  self-imposed [break in transmission] instead, such countries  should give assistance to the (?threatened) innocent people.    5. The RPF has noted that some countries and nongovernmental  organizations have already given assistance to the victims of  war. Some others have not. It is sad to note that the French  Government has (?responded) and given audience to the  self-imposed government in Rwanda. Does this mean that the  French Government is supporting the killing done in Rwanda, and  by the people who make up this government?    6. The RPF wishes to remind the international community of  the following:    a. That the international community has obligations and  responsibilities toward human beings and life should not be  destroyed to this extent while the international community keeps  quiet about it;    b. the RPF condemns any country or organization that [words  indistinct] or recognition to the self-imposed government in  Rwanda and condemns anything done by any country to promote the  interests of this government as regards international relations;    c. The RPF appeals to the international community to  dissassociate themselves from this government and even to extend  asylum to those who took part in the killings [as heard];    d. The RPF requests the international community not to lose  hope because of the open threat that the killers will continue  to murder and kidnap people;    e. the RPF wishes to extend its sincere thanks and  appreciation to all countries, international organizations and  individuals who have shown concern for the plight of the  Rwandese people during these difficult times.    Done at Mulindi this 30th day of April 1994.    Signed by Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, chairman of the RPF.

The  clique continues to mislead Rwandans by using the ethnic issue,  even though it is irrelevant.    They claim their troops are fighting against Belgians and  Ugandans in addition to the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF].  These are pure lies. In their claim that they are fighting  Belgians, Ugandans and the RPF, we want to know how their troops  are fighting? What are their numbers so as to be able to fight  whites, foreigners and the RPF all at the same time? Rwandans,  you can understand that these are lies. You should not listen  to the clique of killers who are following their own interests,  as has always been the case when they dare to claim that their  troops are doing well at the front, as if the troops themselves  are unaware of how they have been defeated by the RPF troops.

headline:    Cabinet Issues Communique on State of the Nation 
text:  BFN     [Text] Members of the broad-based National Union and Public  Salvation Government met today at the weekly cabinet meeting,  which was chaired by Prime Minister Faustin Ririndwa. Here is a  report on the cabinet session, read by government spokesman  N'gongo Luwowo, minister of communication and press.    [Begin Luwowo recording] Under the chairmanship of His  Excellency Mr. Faustin Birindwa, the prime minister and head of  government, the members of the transitional executive met today,  29 April, at the Hotel du Conseil, for their weekly meeting.  The following items were examined:    1. The state of the nation.    2. The situation within the High Council of the Republic-  Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT].    3. The situation in Rwanda.    Moving to examine the first item, government members were  informed about an increasingly greater influx of Rwandan and  foreign refugees moving towards Zaire, who were searching for a  haven of peace and tranquility. Goma in North Kivu and all the  border towns with Rwanda are particularly affected by this  influx of people -- men, women, and children -- completely in  disarray and fleeing the atrocities which the various rival  Rwandan factions are engaged in.    Today's cabinet meeting also examined the unfortunate  incidents which took place on the night of 26 April in  Mbanza-Ngungu in Bas-Zaire, during which undisciplined men in  uniform engaged in certain reprehensible acts. The cold storage  facilities of some shops in Manza-Ngungu were looted of their  contents.    After rapidly bringing these undisciplined soldiers under  control, the military hierarchy -- immediately after bringing  the situation under control -- dispatched to Mbanza-Ngungu the  chief of staff of the Army, the deputy chief of staff of the  National Gendarmerie, and an intelligence officer from the  General Chief of Staff Headquarters. All these officers were  charged with conducting a thorough investigation into the  authors behind these incidents.    The same team is charged with determining the level of  responsibility of all those involved, before sending them to a  military tribunal for exemplary and appropriate punishment. In  this regard, the Government of the Republic wants to strongly  denounce the misinformation campaign recently launched by some  politicians who, it says, have intentionally spread lies and  false rumors, with the aim of inciting our uniformed countrymen  to engage in actions that run counter to military duty and  discipline.    The minister in charge of relations with the HCR-PT briefed  the government team on an unfortunate incident which took place  yesterday at the People's Palace, where a group of parliamentary  members belonging to the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition  and allies [USOR], prevented the plenary session of the  transitional legislative organ from taking place. Shouting,  whistling, chanting songs, and making a great amount of noise in  the room, these transitional parliamentarians, some of which  wore sporting outfits, pushed their irresponsibility to the  point of tearing the attendance form to pieces on two occasions.    There is every indication that the parliamentarians had  planned this action -- they do not seem to grasp the magnitude  of the nobility of their mission and the importance of the great  task they shoulder. At a time when a serious economic and  political crisis is hitting the country, the Zairian people have  a right to expect different behavior from the assemblymen, and a  different attitude within this transitional institution.    In every respectable parliament other methods and language  exist that are better fitted to situations which may crop up.  Also, there are other means of expressing one's opinions within  a parliamentary house. Until the contrary is proven, whistling,  chants, and the attitudes demonstrated yesterday at the People's  Palace, are not what the sovereign people of our country expect  of their representatives.    The search for solutions to the ills plaguing Zaire calls  for  a display of a minimum amount of tolerance, civility, and  courtesy to those who do not share the same ideas.    In conclusion, the executive members of the Transition  Executive deliberated on the prevailing situation in neighboring  Rwanda -- a brotherly, friendly country. The Government of the  Republic is keenly following developments in Kigali, as well as  in other towns and communities in Rwanda, and bitterly deplores  the undescribable horrors and massacres perpetrated with  impunity by armed political and military factions.    The government also deplores the unexplainable indifference  shown by the international community, which seems to have opted  to turn its back on the immense Rwandan tragedy, while under  other skies huge resources have been deployed to reduce  prevailing tensions and to extinguish the fires of conflict.    The Republic of Zaire calls on all peace and justice loving  countries to coordinate their efforts to bring Rwandans back to  understanding, concord, and peace. Zaire asks all the nations  of the world to use every means at their disposal to persuade  the Rwandan brothers to turn their backs on the dark path of war  and tread back on the bright path of dialogue and discussion,  which is the token of a just and lasting peace.    The meeting started at 1000 and ended at 1500. Thank you.  [end recording]

text:  BFN     [Text] At a plenary session in Lusaka, Zambia, today,  delegations from the government and the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] reached an agreement on  specific principles for the conclusion of the second round of  presidential elections. The second round of presidential  elections will take place under the terms established by the  National Assembly. Our reporter in Lusaka Alves Antonio closely  followed the event.    [Begin Antonio recording] Good evening! At a plenary session  today negotiating teams from the government and UNITA finally  approved the eight points of the specific principles for the  conclusion of presidential elections. The second round of  presidential elections will take place on a date set by the  National Assembly, after a declaration by the United Nations  that conditions stipulated by law have been created. Other  conditions required for the implementation of this process  include security guarantees, free movement of people and goods,  and people's freedom throughout the national territory. Sources  close to the talks told Luanda Radio that it was not easy to  approve the document [words indistinct] open and constructive  discussions from the negotiating teams from the government and  UNITA, even experienced periods of despair.    Also regarding the conclusion of the second round of  presidential elections, the negotiating teams from the  government and UNITA now have, until 3 May, the task of  preparing documents dealing with modalities for the  implementation of this process.    Meanwhile, a source close to the talks once again stressed  the sense of responsibility demonstrated by the government  negotiating team, which has been acting with flexibility and,  above all, with prudence.

text:  BFN     [Text] Despite the peace efforts under way in the Zambian  capital, the communist Luanda regime continues to sow terror  inside Angola. In the area of N'dalatando, the capital of  Cuanza Norte Province, the regime's troops are still trying to  occupy the city. However, the People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] are meeting with a firm response  from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] forces. Our correspondent reports on the situation over  the last 48 hours.    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] 1. The enemy  forces have over the last 48 hours tried to recover the body of  (van den Berg), a South African mercenary who was killed on 26  April;    2. In their first attempt on 27 April, the defeated FAPLA  forces left another seven soldiers confirmed killed on the  ground. There were also indications that several wounded men  may have been dragged away from the battleground as the Luanda  regime's forces fled in disarray [words indistinct] ammunition  belt, and a number of rucksacks with assorted equipment;    3. At 0730 on 28 April, the enemy once again tried to get  near the area. They used three T-55 tanks and intense fire from  three Luanda air force combat fighters to provide cover for the  FAPLA forces. Those aircraft dropped phosphorus and napalm  bombs. The fire caused by those bombs could be seen some 40 km  away. Our forces on the ground say they saw fresh vegetation  burning and an area of 600 square meters was completely burned.    There were no victims, thanks to our forces' technical and  tactical skills, and now the siege is tightening.    4. Taking into account the human and material losses that  Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace is suffering in its attempt to  recover the body of (Van den Berg), the aforementioned South  African mercenary, we can only assume that he must have been a  very important person. The forces of the Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola government will experience even more  losses, should they continue to [word indistinct] lives. The  morale of the brave Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  could not be higher and they are determined to see that the  watchword is observed in this province: whether it is attacked  from land or from the air, N'dalatando will not fall.  N'dalatando is with UNITA. N'dalatando is with Dr. Jonas  Malheiro Savimbi. N'dalatando is with the patriots. [end  recording]

headline:    Names of AWB Members Charged in Bombings Reported 
text:  BFN     [By Angela Quintal]     [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- Three senior Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance] officials were  among 33 right-wingers who appeared in the Johannesburg regional  court on Friday [29 April] in connection with bomb attacks in  the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region since  Sunday.    AWB chief-of-staff Josias Alexander van Cruywagen,  Ystergaarde [Iron Guard] Commander Leon van der Merwe and the  organisation's executive secretary Nico Prinsloo were among the  accused.    Assistant Police Constable Hercules Jacobus Coetsee and  police reservist Andreas Coetzee also face charges ranging from  19 counts of murder, 191 counts of attempted murder, vehicle  theft, malicious damage to property and charges under the arms  and ammunition and explosives acts.    A 34th accused, Mr P Koekemoer, could not attend the hearing  because he was in a Rustenburg hospital after being shot in a  foot.    The accused packed the courtroom, dressed casually rather  than in AWB uniforms, and occupied benches brought in to expand  the dock. The group included a father and son, both named  Cornelius Johannes Botha.    Relatives and friends, including AWB leader Eugene  Terreblanche's brother Andries, sat in the public gallery and a  large contingent of local and foreign media jammed the courtroom.    The men, many in their late teens and early 20s, were not  asked to plead and State Advocate Brink Ferreira requested that  they be remanded in custody until July 10.    Counsel for the defence, represented by Advocates H L  Prinsloo and H van der Walt and Attorney Fanie van Vuuren,  argued that proper consultation with their clients for a bail  application was impossible because the charge sheet did not  provide sufficient detail. They submitted that according to the  interim constitution every person had the right to information  in the possession of the state or its agents to protect their  rights.    They also submitted that because bail was a fundamental  right  protected by the constitution, the accused were entitled to bail  unless the state could prove on a balance of probabilities that  the granting of bail was not in the interests of justice.    Mr Ferreira argued that the constitutional provisions to the  right to information applied only to accused on trial. As they  had yet to plead to charges the provision could not apply.    Magistrate C J van Heerden ordered the state to provide  additional information so the defence could prepare for the bail  application. He added that, according to the constitution, the  state had the burden of convincing the court on a balance of  probabilities why bail should not be granted.    After a short adjournment the state expanded on the charge  sheet, saying six of the murder charges related to the Bree  Street, Johannesburg, car bombing on March 24, a further eight  murder charges related to the bomb in Germiston on March 25 and  the rest to a bombing in Bloed Street, Pretoria, later the same  day.    The vehicle theft charges related to cars used in the three  bombings.    Details of the identity of the deceased would be given to  the  defence once the information became available, Mr Brink said.    The 34 accused were facing charges in their personal  capacity  and as part of a conspiracy.    Mr van Heerden then ruled the bail application should be  heard in the Johannesburg regional court on May 16 and that the  accused be remanded in custody until then.    Another of the accused, who cannot be named because he is a  minor, appeared briefly in court after the main hearing. He was  released into the care of his mother and was warned to report  twice a day to the Rustenburg police station.    The other accused, from Randfontein, Carletonville,  Ventersdrop, Rustenburg and Pretoria, include: Clint Ellish,  Abraham Liebenberg Myburg, Pieter Daniel van der Merwe, Nicolaas  Clifton Barnard, Jan Antonie Oelofse, Serge Marie Joseph  Dabbabie, Douglas Pieter Taylor, Gerhard William Antonius  Elbers, Dirk Jacobus Coetzee Meyer, Marthinus Albertus Deysel,  Nelson George Woutberg, Gustav Woutberg, Gert Kruger Jacobus  Albert, Louis Johannes Fouri, Hermanus Steyn Luyt, Theunis van  Schalkwyk, Andries Wilhemus Nel, Milestone Sharp, Zacharius  Johannes Beneke, Willem Frans Johannes Hattingh, J P Olivier,  Jacobus Petrus Nel, Johannes Coenraad Smit, Pieter Duvenhage and  Roelof Johannes Fouche.

text:  BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 29 SAPA -- A 19-year-old police  constable, held up by a motorist he confronted at Jan Smuts  Airport, had a narrow escape on Friday [29 April] morning when  the motorist produced a gun and pulled the trigger while  pointing it at the policeman's stomach. The gun failed to fire.    Constable Stephan Botha had been manning a roadblock at the  airport's entrance when a yellow Toyota Hi-Ace [minibus],  bearing the registration NYY301T showed no signs of intending to  stop, according to a police report. After the failed attempt  had been made on the policeman's life, Constable Botha managed  to hit the motorist in the face with the butt of his firearm  after which the man ran away. Two other occupants of the  vehicle also tried to run away. "But Constable Jaco Botha, also  19, and Sgt Michael Brennen, 25, managed to arrest them," said  the report.    Two 9mm pistols, magazines and ammunition were recovered  from  the vehicle which had been robbed from its owner in Isando  shortly before the incident.

headline:    South African Press Review for 1 May 
text:  BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>   IEC's `Monumental Incompetence' Viewed--"The elections were  declared free and fair on Friday [29 April] by Mr Justice  Kriegler...and his view was immediately endorsed by the leaders  of the two main political parties, Mr F W de Klerk and Mr  Mandela." So begins Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 1  May in a page-24 editorial. "However, in looking forward it is  necessary to hold in mind the lessons of the monumental  incompetence with which the Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC] conducted these elections. Those lessons, by no  coincidence, confirm the message transmitted by the breakdown of  the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. In both cases, we  flirted with disaster. Both institutions sprang from a  suspicion, more prevalent among political elites than among the  people at large, that no institution of government can be  trusted if it seems to represent the old regime. Behind the  formation of the NPKF lay a naive belief that ill-trained and  ill-disciplined irregulars could be welded in a matter of weeks  into a professional army." "Similarly, the IEC was born of  distrust of the Department of Home Affairs, the only institution  in the country which -- with the backing of the SA Police and  the SADF [South African Defense Force] -- might have conducted  orderly, properly controlled elections. The attempt to create  an `independent' substitute organisation, as it turned out,  became more of a threat to the transition than a help." "As Mr  de Klerk is fond of saying, we only have one SADF, one police  force, and one civil service. We also have, more amorphously,  only one business class. Whether the government of national  unity is to have any hope of satisfying the reasonable  expectations of the people who, in their millions, have given it  a mandate, depends on these existing institutions. The callow  socialist ideologues who surround Mr Mandela have had two vivid  demonstrations of what happens when they, unlettered and  inexperienced, try to `organise' and `plan' the life of the  nation. They are incompetent to do so."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   National Election Victory Urged -- Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 25 April asks in a page-10 editorial: "Can our  country's largest so-called liberation movement be given the  mandate to govern the country for the next few years? Four  years ago we would have given an unconditional no. Since then  the ANC has changed in fundamental aspects. Policies and  reasonable statements give one courage for the future. The  negotiations also showed how sensible people could change  radical views and find one another. But in other ways,  unfortunately, the ANC remains unchanged. They remain in  coalition with the South African Communist Party... and the  virus of debilitating socialism thus remains part of the ANC."  The National Party has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis and  shown that it is representative of all groups in the country.  "The values for which this changed party stands are those with  which we can most easily identify. Its leader is a person of  integrity and vision who helped create a new South Africa of  justice and full participation. He deserves support in order  for him to complete his task, and therefore we recommend him and  his party," concludes BEELD.    Bombers Cannot Stop Change--BEELD on 26 April says in a  page-12 editorial that "those cowardly murderers who believe  they can stop the approach of democracy in South Africa with  their bombing campaign are busy unleashing a rage unknown among  the vast majority of South Africans. It is a rage which totally  counters what the bombers are trying to achieve. It is uniting  South Africans across all barriers as seldom seen before against  violence and bloodshed." "The bombings have cost valuable lives  and caused extensive damage to property, and that cannot be  tolerated." "One realizes that the security forces are  stretched very thinly on the ground at present," but "the  present situation demands drastic action. The country expects  the same decisive action to be taken as was the case in the  eighties when destabilization came from the other side of the  political spectrum. Activists and instigators were rounded up  then, regardless of who they were. The same medicine is needed  now."    CP Losing All Its Decent Leaders -- "The Conservative Party  [CP] is systematically losing all the reasonable, decent people  within its leadership," states a second editorial on the same  page of the 26 April BEELD. "The latest are Messrs Driew Bruwer  and Thomas Langley, who walked over to General Constand  Viljoen's Freedom Front [FF] after they were reassured about the  negotiations process through the accord signed at the weekend  between the front, the government, and the ANC. This accord,  which confirms the front's right to negotiate for a homeland,  does not guarantee that it will be achieved. That will depend  on the strength of the argument and its practicality." "The CP  leaders trickling over to the FF are apparently only the tip of  the iceberg. Beneath the surface there is no doubt a much  greater movement of reasonable people who wish to follow the  decent path. All that will remain then will be the diehard CP  members who are unable to negotiate anything for themselves."

text:  BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Inefficient Election--"Give or take a few rough edges," the  South African election will probably be "a fair reflection of  the broad will of the people," notes an editorial in the  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 2 May on page 12. However,  "too many foreign observers" assessed the polls "as remarkable  and then added the rider `...by African standards.'" "A cold  assessment of the election will not cast a particularly  complimentary light on its administrators, the IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission]." Voting was "chaotic in some areas," as  "vast numbers of ballot papers went missing and the required  voting equipment just did not arrive." "Crisis management" was  supplied as "the Government, the National Peace Secretariat and  others came to the IEC's rescue." "The new South Africa could be  born into a culture of sloppiness -- where crisis management  becomes a way of life. During the transition to democracy it was  sometimes necessary to bend the rules, to turn a blind eye. In  the interests of good government and an ordered society, that  must not be repeated."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Journalists Coverage of Election -- As the media "definition  of news" is "that which is unusual," says the editorial in  Johannesburg SOWETAN on 2 May, "it is therefore not susprising  that they have turned the attention of the country to what went  wrong during the election. We have written extensively about  problems with the delivery of material to voting stations, the  late starts at polling stations, the problems at the counting  centres and the painful struggle to get the results out." "The  only sad thing is that we might have shifted the focus away from  the great things achieved in a short week of history-making."  "We did not make a noise about the IEC's achievements." And the  rightwing strategy to disrupt the elections "went terribly  wrong. It seems its potential threat to a democratic South  Africa was overblown or only in the imagination of foreign  journalists." "It is now history that last week's four days of  polling were the most peaceful in South Africa in years."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Loyal Opposition -- "By next week we will have swapped  one-party rule for what might be no more than two-party power  sharing in a government of national unity," notes an editorial  headlined "Election Comment -- the Editor" in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 May on page 1. "Ironically the Nats  [National Party] will be cast in the role of a loyal opposition,  loyal to the extent that party members will be in the Cabinet  and will be jointly responsibile with ANC members for Cabinet  decisions." "While the totalitarian impluse might be to dismiss  the small parties as irrelevant, the contributions the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party], Freedom Front and DP [Democratic Party]  can make should not be overlooked. They might be thorns in the  government's flesh and some might represent fairly narrow  interests, but their opposition must be viewed as constructive  if the country is to succeed in its quest for national  reconciliation." The "different factions" of the ANC are  expected to "hold together" and to "continue to do so for a  while, reaping popular support from Nelson Mandela." "Eventually  the ANC will need to develop a role as a broadly popular party  of the center capable of building a strong economy while  retaining mass support," however "this may eventually cost the  party a radical wing which tires of power-sharing." "Making the  transition will be a necessary foundation for the country's  future stability. It will be made easier if the concept of a  loyal opposition is acknowledged for the first time in decades."    New Economic Era -- The country is poised to enter a new  economic era, just as surely it is entering a new political  one," notes an editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY on 2 May  on page 12. "South Africans need and expect thoughtful economic  stewardship just as they need and expect thoughtful political  management. Without the first, the second cannot succeed." While  the threats of inflation and recession remain, "sound economic  stewardship" implies "fiscal incentives that encourage  industrialists to expand and to create jobs." While funds have  been promised from abroad, state borrowing cannot "force up  interest rates to levels that halt industrial expansion.    Sound economic stewardship should, however, lead to growth  rates that quickly expand the country's tax base. The conomic  cake will then be big enough for eveyone to have a fair share."

Mr.  Colyn said the final provisional count would be made known by  early tomorrow morning. He said good progress was being made  and minor problems were being ironed out.    [Begin Colyn recording] By 5 o'clock this afternoon a high  percentage of the counting will be completed. We have  experienced problems with the counting, especially in two areas.  The one area is where we have a voting venue comprising various  voting stations.

The other area is the  outlying parts of the country where you have tremendous  logistical problems to do with counting. I'm confident that the  counting of votes will more or less be completed by midnight  tonight. We get positive reports from all over the country.    As far as Northern Transvaal is concerned, problems  experienced there, I'm quite sure, they have been resolved now.  We have sent in expert teams to assist it.

You will  recall that at an earlier briefing we did say that we had some  human resource, or staff, or personnel problems at the counting  centers in Queenstown and Umtata in the Eastern Cape. We are  pleased that staff at Queenstown sub-regional office have gone  back to work and at Umtata there has been an acceptance of the  agreement in principle, and therefore counting started at 5PM  this afternoon.    In KwaZakhele, as I promised to report, the allegation of  tempering with ballot boxes is still being investigated and the  South African Police are involved.    Empangeni -- we have a technical error there in that the  lines are down, therefore we cannot be fed with information. I  just want to emphasize that that does not necessarily say work  or counting is not continuing. It's just that we cannot be  accessed. Newcastle as a center -- Vryheid and Ngotje are still  reconciling. In North-West Mafikeng Center, the center is still  trying to address its staffing problems. We have problems with  staff at the Mafikeng center as well.    In Schweizer-Reneke, Vryburg, Bloemhom and Delareyville  counting is continuing. In Christiana counting is continuing,  and it is believed that results are imminent. Khanyetsa -- they  are not counting as yet, but reconciliation is continuing. In  Taung and Kuruman they are at the reconciliation stage. In the  Northern Transvaal, Thohoyandou Center, reconciliation was  completed in Messina and they are awaiting confirmation to  proceed with the counting. In Soutpansberg reconciliation has  just begun. It is estimated that the process should be  completed by 7PM this evening. In Phalaborwa reconciliation has  begun. No stations have started counting as yet. Ellisrus --  still reconciling, counting is imminent, and I will hand over to  my colleague, Kumi, to give you an updated situation as far as  the Nasrec Center [National Exhibition Center] is concerned.    [Naidoo] Judge Kriegler, Mrs. Helen Suzman, and  representatives of the major political parties met at Nasrec  this afternoon where votes for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] province are being counted, to discuss difficulties  around the reconciliation process which has delayed the start of  the count. The reconciliation is acknowledged to be a cause for  concern. In order not to delay the counting in this important,  most populous region in the country, which should be under way  already, a working system as agreed -- whereby the ballots which  can be reconciled, will be reconciled -- allowing the counting  to begin immediately. In the interim each party will appoint a  representative to a team which with the IEC will deal with all  problem cases, dissolve as any as possible by agreement, and put  the ballots into the count. A second team will deal with the  more problematic cases where agreement could not be reached, and  continue to try to find agreement on these cases.    Meanwhile, all objections are being noted and will be lodged  with the IEC to be dealt with at headquarters. The results that  become available will be tally figures before the resolution of  disputes. The IEC appeals to party officials to cooperate with  the IEC in getting the answers to the voters as expeditiously as  possible.    [Cronje] Ladies and gentlemen, we discussed the situation at  the Mitchell's Plain counting center, where at a previous  briefing we announced that over half of the total votes will be  handled. I have an update for you that an agreement was reached  between the IEC and the parties there. They are expediting the  process of reconciliation. Instead of the counting officers  checking individual boxes from voting stations against the  counterfoils, the counting officers will receive the boxes,  count the papers, and keep the totals, and then transfer that  straight into party support, but while doing this a group of  auditors will sit with the tallies from the first count and they  will use those tallies as a check for the counterfoils. The  counting officers will give the results from the boxes and the  auditors will then give their count of the reconciliation.

headline:    Kriegler on Counting Difficulties 
text:  BFN     [News conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler,   international commissioner Professor Walter Kamba, and official  Pieter Cronje at the IEC media center at Gallagher Estate in  Midrand -- live]    [Text] [Kriegler] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The  question that's being asked is: Where are we now? I'd like to  deal with that and answer questions afterwards from anybody who  wants further clarity. An election consists basically of three  phases: the voting phase, the counting phase, and the  calculation phase. We are now in the counting phase where the  millions of ballots that were cast are being reconciled and  counted. I'm aware of the fact that there is impatience. I  have a great deal of sympathy with that, but I must say that  from the first press interview that I held months ago I have  been at pains to meet precisely this impatience. We have said  in the IEC, from day one, it is going to take time to do the  counting and it is taking time, and we're not worried about  that. It must take time.    Let us get a few things clear. Number one, this is a  people's election like this country has never seen. It involves  the remotest villages in the far reaches of Venda, to the green  hills of Zululand, now KwaZulu, to the mountains and crags of  the Transkei, and for the very self-same reasons that it is  difficult to get the ballots out there, it is difficult to get  them back. It's not unexpected and it's not alarming. It is  simply an inevitable consequence of the election that we are  involved in. That is why we at the IEC have consistently said,  be patient. Now the very transportation and communication and  logistical problems that resulted in our starting late with the  voting, have had a knock-on effect on the counting which is  obvious. You can't start counting till all of the voting has  been done. The very self-same communications problems in  getting the ballots out there, up into the hills, are  encountered in getting them back again, and you can't start  counting until you've got all of them back. That takes time.    Moreover, it's not only a people's election in terms of the  electorate. It was made clear from the outset that this was to  be an election for all South Africans, run by all South  Africans. That means that there are tens of thousands of people  involved in the process who have never been involved in such a  process before. There are tens of thousands out there who have  difficulty in dealing with the painstaking accounting processes  involved in making a return in respect of an election.    That has caused us problems. I tell you that frankly.  ballot boxes have been returned not in a meticulous fashion.  Also in many places, because of the very nature of the election  where we had no voters' roll, the turnout at some voting  stations was very much higher than anybody had anticipated, and  that resulted in the voting process being overloaded. One of  the problems was that the ballot boxes became overfull. Some  presiding officers, using commendable initiative, took emergency  measures at the time, emptied that ballot box into a container  and replaced the ballot box in the voting station to enable the  people to exercise their democratic right to vote.    Now to a meticulous election administrator, opening a ballot  box in the voting station is a surprising step to take. The  presiding officers in those voting stations had a choice. They  either had to turn the voters away, or they had to make a plan,  and they made a plan, and that plan is not such a bad plan in  retrospect. The alternative would have been much worse. The  people were patient, but if there had been further blockages in  the voting process, the consequences could have been grave. But  this means that when you get to the counting stage, you've got a  problem at the outset where you have to do a reconciliation of  ballot papers issued to the presiding officer, ballot papers  returned with votes cast, rejected ballot papers where people  have asked for a new one because they had made a mistake on the  first one, and unused returned ballot papers.    Now where you have not got the ballots in a sealed box, that  return is of relatively little value, and the reconciliation  becomes very, very difficult. I went to Nasrec [National  Exhibition Center] this afternoon, which is a very big counting  station, and I took the opportunity to go to each of the  counting points in that complex and explained to the party  representatives there gathered, and to all of the officials of  the IEC, that what is important is to get the count done. The  reconciliation, which is so complex in these circumstances,  should take a back seat. What is important is that the people  who have voted now want to hear the results.    It means, and I put it bluntly, it means departing from the  prescribed procedure, the prescribed procedure which is a  carefully worked out set of returns that must balance with one  another. But the IEC resolves this afternoon, that the counting  process cannot be held up by these reconciliation procedures.  And I want to explain why we did so, and why we think that it  is the best in the circumstances. Our Electoral Act is a very  strange document and provides for a truly unique election. In  the first instance of course it's unique to us because we've  never had a proportional representational election in the  country at all. Those of us who have been privileged to vote  have known a constituency based election. This is a different  type of election.    In the second place, and more significantly, this is an  election in which nobody was obliged to vote at a particular  voting station. You could vote at the point of your choice. So  there could be no prediction as to how many people could be  anticipated at any one voting station. In the third instance,  nobody really knew what the extent of the electorate was. The  statistics were the subject of a great deal of debate, and on  virtually only one thing the statisticians could agree, and that  nobody could be certain within reasonable tolerances.    The experience of the last few days would indicate that most  of those estimates were substantially too low. I put that  guardedly, advisedly, because that impression may not eventually  prove to have been valid. But the most important unique feature  of this election is that there was no voters' roll. Therefore,  the ordinary kind of return rendered by a presiding officer was  of very, very limited value. If I could use the image of  plotting a point on map, you really need three lines to cross  before you've got a reasonably accurate fixing of that point.  Two lines get you nowhere and one line is totally useless.    Now what we have here is a return by the presiding officer  of  the ballots issued to him, and a return eventually of the  ballots he brings back to the counting station, broken down into  those votes cast, those not used, and those spoilt. And it  gladdens a bureaucrat's heart to see that reconciliation, but  upon analysis it tells you nothing of any consequence. Unless  you have an accurate indication of the people who had voted, you  do not have the third line in order to plot your point. If I  can make it as plain as I can, all that reconciliation tells you  is what the presiding officer received, and what he is giving  back, but it doesn't tell you how many ballots he is giving back  with votes cast by voters. He is giving you a return of the  seats and returns, and nothing else. Unless and until you can  check that against a voters' roll, or possibly a turnstile which  would give you numbers of people that entered, you do not have  real verification.    Each and every ballot cast must have on the back of it the  identifying stamp of that voting station. Without that stamp  that ballot is automatically rejected. That is a safeguard  against someone who does not have access to the stamp stuffing  the ballot box.    But of course there is nothing in the procedure that  prevents a corrupt presiding officer from putting the stamps on  the back of ballots that he fills in to his or her choice. But  that is the process we've got, and that is the process that the  act creates, and that's the one we've got to live with. You are  reliant upon the integrity and the fear of detection of the  presiding officer, the vigilance of the party agents and of the  others in the voting station. Reconciliation in those  circumstances is of minimal value. It is of course so that it is  a safeguard against him removing ballot papers, but then he  could replace them with others at will if he wished to be  dishonest. That is why we said, inasmuch as so many  inexperienced people had rendered defective returns and inasmuch  as the reconciliation rarely served, ultimately, no real  purpose. If you can reconcile, by all means do so, and if you  can't reconcile, note each one of the defects, note the  objections of the parties, if any, if they can't resolve it, and  carry on with the counting, because what is announced is not the  result but the tally and that tally, we at the IEC will have to  evaluate in the light of the nature and extent of the  imperfections and the reconciliation process, the nature and the  extent of the objections, and the degree to which the parties  may have agreed in respect of some of it. That is calculated to  shorten the procedure with minimal risk to the veracity of the  result. If I can put it this way: As far as we are concerned,  the election is about national reconciliation, not ballot  reconciliation. Let's forget about the formalities. Let's get  on with finding out what the people said they want. Thank you.    [Cronje] Thank you, Judge Kriegler. Could I hand over to  Professor Walter Kamba, one of the IEC's international  commissioners, to give you his opinion on this election? Prof.  Kamba.    [Kamba] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I start by  saying this has been a remarkable election -- remarkable in a  number of ways. Firstly, in relation to its magnitude, its  size. Secondly, in relation to the circumstances in which the  election is being held. It has been a mammoth task never seen  before -- organized by a nation. The size of the bureaucracy  that has had to be established in so short a time is absolutely  incredible, and the commission has been mandated with the  responsibility of running such an enormous event within a very  short time, putting up such a large size of civil servants, if  one may call them that, a lot of them with no experience  whatsoever in running an election. The logistical arrangements  that have had to be made have been equally of enormous size and  the sheer logistics of getting polling stations, counting  stations, delivery of various material, has been of enormous  size, and the commission is very much aware that there has been  a lot of imperfections. But if you take into account those  factors that I have indicated, and also the manner in which a  number of issues have been chopped and changed as we proceeded  to the final stage, have added enormous difficulties to the  whole process.    Reports from you of how the actual voting process proceeded  were characterized by the great commitment, the enthusiasm, the  determination of the voters to go to the polls, and their  attitude which they have reflected -- how they regarded this as  a major event in their lives, particularly those who were  first-time voters, but even those who had votes before -- they  had never voted in any election of this kind. This is a  national event to which the nation is committed, and the mandate  of the IEC was really to deliver this election in the most  difficult of circumstances, so when one comes to evaluate the  election one must evaluate it in that context, and those who  have complaints must really channel the complaints along the  procedures that have been indicated, so that those complaints  can be looked into and be added to the factors that have to be  taken into account in coming to a final decision. The  fundamental element in the election is to ensure that the  country, its voters, have expressed their view in an atmosphere  in which there is virtually no violence, virtually no  intimidation, and we have seen, we have witnessed, the  environment in which voters have streamed to the polls. It has  been clear that whatever violence that existed prior to the  actual polling process was almost absent when it came to the  voters expressing their view.    Procedures have been set up to deal with the question of  counting, to deal with how you handle ballot boxes, how they  should be submitted. I think we have set up adequate procedures  to ensure that each vote that is counted can be said to be a  valid vote, and that, I think, to me and to the commission, is  what is of fundamental importance. If at the end of the day we  can say the votes that were cast -- the votes that all parties  who attend the counting centers -- can themselves agree the  valid votes were in fact so, and that this determines the  ultimate result of the elections. [sentence as heard] And I, as  one of the international members who had participated in the  process, I think we have done what we can to reinforce the  impartiality, the independence, of the electoral commission, and  to the extent humanly possible, to ensure that at the end of the  day we can say the votes cast were valid votes, and represent  the choice of the people of South Africa. Thank you.    [Cronje] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will ask you  to identify yourself please. At this stage, to give everyone a  fair chance, limited to one question, no supplementaries please.  Can we start? Karen?    [Correspondent Karen Bruinaard] My question is directed to  Mr. Justice Kriegler. Sir, you took a very bold step, if I am  correct, in deciding to overthrow a very important safety  precaution, when you decided not to take reconciliation into  account in certain circumstances. My question is: Will this  speed up the process? On the other hand, we saw tonight that  more or less one percent of the total vote has been counted so  far. When do you expect a tally, or even a final outcome?  Could it be before Friday? Thank you.    [Kriegler] I take it that both questions were facetious. If  I didn't make it plain, I will do so afterwards. I don't want  to take up time unnecessarily. I will explain precisely why it  is not a valuable safeguard at all. It is no safeguard at all  if you haven't got a voters' roll or a count, an independent  count of voters, but we can debate it afterwards. With regard  to the second, most certainly before Friday.    [Cronje] Pierre?    [Correspondent Pierre Classen] Can I also address the judge  please? Could you tell us, in making this modification to the  procedures, did you get the approval or condoning of the parties  concerned, and do you think that after the result they will  still in a good spirit accept your decision in this matter?    [Kriegler] Did you say the last....    [Classen, interrupting] The political parties, and after the  result, do you think they will still accept your decision in  this matter in good spirit?    [Kriegler] I have no doubt that they will. They, the  politicians, know precisely what the minimal value is of the  process as it is, and I discussed with a committee out at Nasrec  [National Exhibition Center] this afternoon, I discussed it with  some of the major parties. Quite frankly, it's a decision that  the IEC has to take and has to live with, and I am happy that I  can justify it to any political party.    [Cronje] Over here please.    [Correspondent Michael Collins] Kind of the same question.  Before the election there were a number of safeguards that were  apparently deemed necessary -- the printing of special ballots  with counterfoils outside the country, the fact that ballot  boxes would remain sealed, the fact that reconciliation was to  take place. With all of these revised because of the  circumstances of the election, are you confident that there is  no chance for fraud on a significant scale, and do you believe  that the parties, especially the parties that are not the main  two parties, who have already been making allegations of  irregularities, will accept this as a legitimate revision of the  Electoral Act?    [Kriegler] I am indeed satisfied, and the commission is  satisfied, that provided a ballot bears the official mark of the  particular voting station, the prospect of there being  significant fraud is very small indeed.    [Cronje] Anton Fisher?    [Correspondent Anton Fisher] Judge, I wanted to ask you --  the sort of shifting reconciliation to the back seat and the  modifications that have been mentioned -- how do you think this  is going to impact on the credibility of the election and the  announcement of a free and fair election?    [Kriegler] That's precisely why I'm here -- to answer each  and every question about it, because we are satisfied that it  does not affect the credibility, and we wish to take the people  with us in that belief. It is not a decision we took lightly.  We think we took it correctly. We are happy to debate that  decision and to establish to the satisfaction of anybody that it  is a responsible decision.    [Cronje] Annette?    [Correspondent Annette Joubert] My question centers around  the question: What happened to the [Orange] Free State's  results? Apparently they have finished already at 1030 this  morning. We have heard nothing. What happened in the Northern  Cape? There are only approximately 500,000 voters. Where are  the results? And then, what is happening to the special  ballots....    [Kriegler, interrupting] Would you mind not having a go at  me  with a shotgun? I'll come back to you, by all means. I simply  can't remember so many questions at once.    [Joubert] Do you not know what's happened to the results in  the Free State, because we've had reports since this morning  that the results have been available since 1030, and...?    [Kriegler, interrupting] No, no results from any voting  station has been available. I don't want to be clever. Tallies  have come in, and we do not wish to put out tallies, even  tallies from the head office, until we have checked them  ourselves. Those figures can go out for public information.  We're happy with that. But we're verifying them as tallies  first.    [Joubert] Just the last part of the question. What is  happening to the overseas ballot papers at this stage?    [Kriegler] I really can't tell you. They should all have  arrived by now, but I'm not sure.    [Cronje] Linda?    [Correspondent Linda van Tilburgh] We've been on air for  quite some time with the results, but it's rather going slow.  To pick up on Karen's question, do you think it will go faster  now? Will we have results rolling in by tomorrow, sort of  creating more excitement than it is now?    [Kriegler] I'm glad you asked the question. I owe you an  apology. I was sharp with you the other day, and I shouldn't  have been. I'm sorry. The process is certainly coming on  stream. Quite apart from the ruling we made, the counting  process is in any event calculated to speed up very rapidly as  all of the counting stations get their preliminary work in  order. You can expect a good deal more rapid returns coming on.    [Van Tilburgh] Can I just ask: from tonight, or from  tomorrow? Because it will affect us staying on air tonight or  not.    [Kriegler] Most of the counting stations are working through  the night.    [Cronje] Over here, please?    [Unidentified correspondent] Judge, first, why if the  reconciliation process is so inconsequential, why was it put in  the electoral law in the first place? And second, I mean, it's  the latest of a series of creative interpretations of the  electoral law. Don't you feel that maybe while you solve  logistical problems and you speed up the process, you are in  fact creating a political problem because -- never mind whether  you are sure that it can't be tampered with -- people who won't  like the election results might jump on this loophole to declare  dissatisfaction with the election?    [Kriegler] With regard to your first question, why is the  procedure in the electoral act if it has such minimal value --  it's a question I've asked myself, and I've come up with an  answer: that the absence of a third coordinate and the  significance thereof was not appreciated. Not one of the senior  political representatives with whom we have debated the issue  disagree with us on that. With regard to the second point, of  course it is possible that particularly a loser will take this  opportunity. It is possible. That is a risk we've got to run.  I believe that the steps, in the circumstances, are so  self-evidently correct that, A, there will be little temptation  to resort to it as a peg on which to hang a declinature to  proceed with the democratic process, and B, would be manifestly  an unjustified resort to that particular step. I may say I  sincerely trust that to some extent the integrity and  impartiality of the commission will satisfy the broad body of  the public out there that this was not done to benefit anybody  or to prejudice anybody. Moreover, upon reflection, what we are  postulating in order to be significant in a proportional  representation system, is an undetected fraud of a massive scale  committed by or in collusion with IEC officials. I think the  prospects of that are pretty remote.    [Cronje] The gentleman right at the back.    [Correspondent Skwezi Skosana] Justice Kriegler, if I may  ask: Are you satisfied about the manner in which the results are  being flashed on the SABC screen and on the radio? The fact  that the results -- they come in percentages -- is that not  going to create a problem, especially to a fairly large majority  of people out there who may not be able to interpret percentages  without giving reference. For example, Western Cape results --  they came in as a percentage without giving reference whether  they are from 10 counting stations, one counting station, or  five.    [Kriegler] I share your view. I agree with you, and I have  already asked that the data be presented in a different form. I  will take it up again tonight when I get back to the office.    [Cronje] Radio (Populare).    [Correspondent Paolo Barnard] Judge Kriegler, one of your  duties will be to declare these elections free and fair, and one  may wonder how free you are to declare these elections free and  fair. Surely, there must be a lot of pressure from the two main  political parties here in this country and international  community. I'm not implying for one second that your judgment  will be conditioned by these pressures. I'm only asking you if  you ever felt these pressures on you, especially from the  international community.    [Kriegler] I am human and of course I'm subject to  pressures.  I don't take the decision alone, thank heavens, but I can assure  you that the pressure of the situation is infinitely more than  any political party could bring to bear. The realization is  stark that if the election cannot be certified we are in a worse  position than we were before the negotiation process started,  and I would not be honest if I did not say that that realization  falls very, very heavily on me. But I've got to live with  myself after this election, and I will not certify if I am not  satisfied that it was a substantially free and fair election as  the statute obliges me to do, and I would like to add that I am  not an auditor who has been called in with a green pen, green  ink pen, to check on technical correctness. If that were my  duty, I would have reported to the state president on Wednesday  morning, that because of the logistical problems we had struck  we would have to take measures which would be technically less  than we would have required, and we shouldn't carry on. We  decided that it was in the national interest to do the emergency  printing and distribution that we did because we believed that  that was the preferable cause to take, once we were staring at  the possibility, on the one hand, of a possibly free and fair  election, and on the other hand, possibly conflagration. We  took the decision in the knowledge that there were risks. The  risks on the other side were much greater and much more likely.    [Cronje] The gentleman over here please.    [Correspondent Themba Khumalo] Judge Kriegler, we have been  told a few hours ago at an earlier briefing, that eight stations  in Durban are not operating because of reconciliation problems.  We have been told also that there are problems at Nasrec.  Obviously people in Natal and in the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions are anxious to know which  party wins and which party will lose. Are you not perhaps  fearing that the delay of the announcement of results in certain  regions might cause some problems in terms of people becoming  angry?    [Kriegler] I wouldn't say that I fear it, but I am aware of  the risk. That is precisely one of the reasons we have said:  Speed up the process. We can't reconcile in many cases. Don't  try the impossible. Get on with the count. Note the  objections. We will deal with them. The people are entitled to  know what the tallies are. I agree with you in that respect.    [Cronje] The gentleman over there, then Tim.    [Correspondent Tan Moyane] Good evening, Judge. I just want  to take you back slightly ...    [Kriegler, interrupting] Can't you ask something of my  colleague Walter, for a moment? [laughter]    [Moyane] In terms of the tallies that are coming in. Some of  us are sitting here at Gallagher Estate and watching you on  Channel IEC, information, and at the same time watching  television. We have just seen a discrepancy. There is more  coming out on TV than what we are seeing here, and from what you  have said just now, are we going to see a speeded up process in  which we get the results from all over? I mean for 90 minutes,  from seven to half past eight, all we saw was Western Cape  national ballot results, and when I came here, Mr. Pieter Cronje  was giving us results about other regions, and we haven't seen  them on the screen here.    [Kriegler] I am confident that the through-put of tallies  from counting stations will materially pick up, yes, and I share  your frustration, I may add.    [Cronje] Tim?    [Tim du Plessis] Mr. Kriegler, we have had a number of  international organizations up here this afternoon, making all  sorts of pronouncements on the elections -- some saying it's  free and fair, some saying it's only free, but they were making  pronouncements on the freeness and the fairness of the election.  We've also had political organizations here saying those  pronouncements were premature. What are your views on this?    [Kriegler] I did not see them. This I will say without fear  of contradiction: The balloting phase of the election was free  and it was fair. The counting phase is at the moment in  progress. There is no reason to think that it won't be  likewise. As far as the arithmetical calculation is concerned,  the same applies.    [Cronje] The gentleman over there with the check shirt.    [Correspondent] Judge, any indication yet of the total  number  of people who have been to the polls?    [Kriegler] Pardon.    [Correspondent] Any indication yet of the total number of  people that have been to the polls?    [Kriegler] No. No. Obviously one can't do that until you've  got the final tallies in. That's one of the snags of not having  a voter's roll.

text:  BFN     [News conference by IEC officials Humphrey Khoza, Pieter   Cronje, and Kumi Naidoo at the media center at Gallagher Estate  in Midrand -- live]    [Excerpt] [Khoza] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and  good morning to you, South Africa. This morning, we are going  to once again give you an update on the elections so far,  particularly the counting process and progress. However, before  we start I am pleased to say that we sincerely hope we will be  getting here a number of commissioners to come and give you  geographic details in terms of what happened during the voting  process during the two, three days in some areas, and also bring  you up to (?speed) about specifics of counting stations in their  respective provinces.    Before we proceed I am now going to hand you over to my  colleague on the extreme left, my left that is, Pieter Cronje,  to give you the latest results as we have them. Over to you,  Pieter.    [Cronje] Good morning. The latest results as at 11:14 AM for  the National Assembly are as follows: PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress], 27,915; Soccer Party, 1,649; VF/FF  [Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front], 95,994; WLP [Worker's List  Party], 622; WRPP [Women's Rights Peace Party], 1,661; XPP  [Ximoko Progressive Party], 677; ACDP [African Christian  Democratic Party], 14,585; ADM [African Democratic Movement],  1,073; AMCP [African Moderates Congress Party], 7,107; AMP  [African Muslim Party], 3,087; ANC, 1,267,462; DP [Democratic  Party], 62,771; DPSA [Dikwankwentla Party of South Africa],  2,772; FP [Federal Party], 2,940; IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party],  70,364; KISS [Keep It Straight and Simple Party], 1,284; Lusap  [LUSO-South African Party], 625; MF [Minority Front], 1,710; NP  [National Party], 814,260; Rejected, 43,214. And the total, as  at 11:14 AM today, 2,421,772.    I also have for you ladies and gentlemen a statement:  Yesterday afternoon, the commission of the IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission] took an important decision to release  results as soon as they became available. That is at a point at  which the results were still formally unverifiable. The  separation of the verification process from the process of  compilation of the results was successfully completed by about  10:00 PM last night. As a consequence of which the flow of  results began to increase exponentially. Where the count had  formerly stood at about 30,000 late yesterday afternoon, the  position unverified, is presently approaching 5 million,  enabling a clearer picture of trends to emerge, and we believe  easing the minds of the electorate about the flow and ultimate  success of this second stage of the electoral process.    Nevertheless, the commission is of the view that the process  should be completed by tomorrow night, and further efforts are  being made to speed up the process of delivering unverified  results. The verification process continues as a parallel  process, and the results of this process will be fed into the  commission's determination of the freeness and fairness of the  result.    Outstanding issues will continue to be dealt with after the  formal announcement of the result, and these issues may cause  minor, if not marginal adjustments to the final picture. Such  adjustments are not expected to affect the overall picture. By  last night this adjustment of the counting process had  dramatically improved the flow of results to the electorate, and  as things stand this morning results known are already showing  the development of clear trends nationally and in certain  provinces.    Three major provincial counting centers, those are Pretoria  Show Grounds, and Nasrec [National Exhibition Center], in the  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, and at the  Durban Expo Center in Natal, are expected to begin delivering  their results during the course of this morning. As these  centers kick into the process, we expect the counting flow to  increase substantially, moving the results process much closer  to finalization.    There has also been some questions about the issue of  reconciliation, and for an explanation of that I hand you to my  colleague Kumi Naidoo.    [Naidoo] There have been several questions with regard to  reconciliation. I will just read the questions out the way that  they are put to us first, and then give you the response. The  first question was....    [Announcer Lester Venter, interrupting] We'll just take my  voice over of what's happening at the press conference there,  just to remind you that as far strictly the results are  concerned, if you sense a small discrepancy in what we already  know and what we hear from the IEC press conference, it is  simply because by virtue of the fact that our results are  slightly ahead--so that discrepancy that you sense is simply  because you're ahead of the IEC official announcement there, so  keep staying with us.    [Naidoo] Officials acting together with the party voting  agents at a particular counting center. Where there is  consensus with the regard to those ballot boxes that have not  yet been reconciled then the counting can proceed with regard to  those specific ballot boxes. Where there might be objections by  any political party, then there is an objection form, prescribed  form, where such objections will be noted. The important point  to note is that these ballot boxes will be separated out and  will be (?recorded) separately in the count.    The second question was: Does this mean we won't know if  extra ballot boxes stuffed with ballots of unknown origins get  slipped into the count? The answer to that is no. We will know  because of the specialized voting station stamp for each voting  station. The voting station number will be on the ballot paper  statement which will be prepared by the presiding officer and  will be checked with the ballots in that particular box.    Thirdly, does this mean we won't know if ballot boxes have  been stolen, mislaid, or lost? The answer there is no, we will  know, because the reconciliation of the ballot boxes itself is  seen as part of the registration and receipt process of the  ballot boxes, which you remember yesterday we said there was a  first phase of the counting process, and that will still  continue. The reconciliation process that the judge referred to  last night, deals primarily with the reconciliation between the  ballot paper statements per ballot box, and the contents of that  box.    Fourth: Has any other election in the world being conducted  without reconciliation? In the elections with a voter's role  reconciliation processes are fairly standard. Countries with an  established electoral system generally have voter's lists.  However, with regard to countries without a voter's role, at  this stage we are not able to confirm whether there are other  similar precedents. We are consulting with our international  commissioners for a speedy answer with regard to this query.    The next question: Where do all the unmarked ballot papers  go now? They are secured at a safe place immediately after the  count. The act provides for the commission to assess all the  returned electoral materials and to destroy them after 30 days  have passed after the count. This would include not only ballot  papers but various other types of forms and other stationary  that cannot be used again.    The next question is when will these unused ballot papers be  counted? These will be done at the counting station and is part  of the documentation that will be worked on by the counting  centers' staff, after the vote itself is done.    And the question that leads on from that is: Will the IEC  try to trace the so-called missing ballots? The answer to that  is yes, and as you probably know already, the IEC has already  instituted two investigations, an internal and an external one.    Okay, there were some additional questions which arrived a  bit late, and I will just respond to them now: What is the  difference between rejected votes and spoilt votes? My  understanding is that there isn't a difference. So, It's just a  issue of terminology. The next question I don't know how to  answer? How did voting go in the hostels on the Rand? Was it  peaceful or tense? I'm not sure whether you can actually have a  peaceful election, and be tense at the same time. But  indications are that there was no reports of violence, and that  elections proceeded smoothly on the hostels generally. [passage  omitted]

headline:    Counting `Way Behind Schedule' at 4 Major Centers 
text:  BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Four major counting  centres, controlling ballots which represent the largest slice  of the election results, were running way behind schedule with  counting by Sunday [1 May] evening. These facts emerged from  internal Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) reports received  on the status of the counting process country-wide at 8PM on  Sunday.    Umtata, Durban, Pretoria and Nasrec [National Exhibition  Center] all reported massive backlogs while the North West,  Western Cape and Northern Cape had almost completed their count.    By 8PM the OFS [Orange Free State] reported that more than  half the votes in the province had been counted.    Information from some regions were sketchy on completed  counts but most counting stations reported progress indicating  that many tallies were ready to be verified and released by IEC  HQ soon.    Difficulties seem to focus on Durban's counting, where the  8PM report recorded that of its 60 stations 32 were not counting  and at 28 there had been no reconciliation. A crisis team had  been sent to deal with the problem.    At Umtata only six of the 61 stations had completed  counting,  50 were counting and two were still reconciling.    In the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region the  bottleneck, expected to take counting into late Monday or even  Tuesday, has occured at Pretoria and at Johannesburg's Nasrec  Centre. Pretoria has reported zero per cent completed, with the  counting stage just reached and the releases of counted batches  only just starting.    At Nasrec the report recorded that counting officers were  still unsure of procedure and monitors were assisting with the  process. Randburg Bryanston, Sharonlea and Marlboror were all  complete.    Vereeniging reported nine per cent complete, the West Rand  52  per cent, East Rand 47 per cent and Johannesburg 15 per cent.  All told, 24.6 per cent of the counting at the PWV's 141  stations had been completed.    The following regional statistics were given:    -- Western Cape: Cape Town 48 stations out of 58 completed  counting with Vredendal and Beaufort West complete.    -- Orange Free State: Welkom nine out of 17 completed,  Kroonstad 11 of 12, Bloemfontein 19 out of 30, Bethlehem 10 out  of 15. But they are also counting the additional QwaQwa station  which was added on Sunday morning.    -- North West: Rustenburg 18 out of 21 completed, Mafeking  five out of 11, Klerksdorp all completed by 7PM, Vryburg eight  out of 11.    -- Eastern Transvaal -- Ermelo 20 out of 28 completed with  four counting, Witbank 16 out of 19 completed.    -- KwaZulu/Natal -- Durban nul out of 60 stations completed,  Empangeni four out of 20, Newcastle five out of 19,  Pietermaritzburg four out of eight, Port Shepstone two out of 18.    -- Northern Cape -- 20 stations out of 32 completed, with De  Aar and Upington expected to be finished shortly after reporting  time.    -- Northern Transvaal -- Ellisras both stations still  counting, Nylstroom one station reconciling and two out of the  four counting, Pietersburg 15 out of 21 counting and five  reconciling, Phalaborwa six completed out of 20, Thohoyando two  completed out of 14, with one still reconciling.    -- Eastern Cape -- Port Elizabeth 12 out of 27 completed,  East London ten out of 19, Queenstown completed, Umtata six out  of 61 completed.    Foreign voting at the DHL warehouse at Isando was reported  as  still proceeding very slowly.

headline:    ANC, IFP in Dispute Over Pirate Stations in Natal 
text:  BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Counting of ballot papers  at the Durban Expo Centre will start on Sunday [1 May]  afternoon, Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] KwaZulu/Natal  Commissioner Dikgang Moseneke said. Speaking at Gallagher  Estate, Midrand, Mr Moseneke said reconciliation at the Durban  Expo Centre had been delayed because of a dispute over "pirate  voting stations".    He said the dispute between the African National Congress  and  Inkatha Freedom Party was serious. Mr Moseneke said he did not  want to comment further because it was a contested issue.    Earlier he said an IEC team was investigating several pirate  polling station in KwaZulu/Natal. Initial reports had been  submitted and would be considered by the commission in its  assessment of whether the elections were free and fair. Ballot  boxes received from these "pirate" stations would be counted  separately.    Votes cast at such stations needed to be considered because  "people who voted believed they were valid stations", he said.    Counting was going ahead at a rate of about 500,000 ballot  papers an hour. The ideal target was a million an hour, Mr  Moseneke said. Counting was delayed in many areas because of  problems with the reconciliation process. Mr Moseneke said  reconciliation had been difficult because inexperienced  presiding officials had not filled out forms correctly in the  rush of voting.    He said some ballot boxes delivered to the Nasrec  [exhibition  center] counting centre near Johannesburg had not been properly  marked, but this did not amount to fraud. The ballot papers  could still be checked because they bore specific voting station  markings.    "I would have been suprised if it had gone smoothly at all  voting stations," he said. He added: "South Africans deserves  nothing less than to have all tallies placed before them in  reasonable time."    By mid-afternoon on Sunday about 5.5 million ballot papers  had been counted. Commenting on suggestions that Department of  Home Affairs officials would have been better able to run the  elections, Mr Moseneke said the commission's Electoral  Administration Chief Director Piet Colyn was a home affairs  official. Some home affairs officials were also in charge of  warehousing ballot papers, he added. Several warehouse managers  are being questioned in connection with missing ballot papers.  Hundreds of thousands of unused ballot papers have been found  in two warehouses in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] region.    IEC Adjudication Division head Mojanku Gumbi said the run-up  to the elections had been free and fair. Only four of the 60  cases before the adjudication division remained unresolved, he  said.

headline:    IFP Leads in Natal 
text:  BFN     [Report by Greg Arde]     [Text] Durban May 1 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  was leading the election race in Natal on Sunday [1 May] evening  but the rival African National Congress was optimistic that its  support would reflect well when counting ended in the province,  conservatively estimated to be late Monday.    IFP spokesman Peter Smith said his party was tentatively  optimistic at 8 PM Sunday, when he said 20 percent of the Natal  vote had been counted. On Sunday afternoon the IFP had at least  60 percent support.    By 7 PM the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said that  while the IFP had only gained just under four percent of the  national vote counted at that time, the party led in Natal. In  KwaZulu/Natal the IFP had 81,459 votes (54.6 per cent) and ANC  32,976 (22.1), the IEC said.    At 7 PM Sunday over 1,000 counting officials were queuing at  Durban's Expo Centre in preparation for their 12-hour shift. A  third of Natal's votes are expected to be counted there.    Earlier reconciliation of ballot boxes there was delayed  because of a dispute over pirate voting stations, which were  allegedly operated in Natal. The IEC said it was investigating  the issue, and reports had been submitted for consideration by  the commission in its assessment of whether the elections were  free and fair.    By noon on Sunday the IEC said counting was on track at most  stations in the province, but the results were only expected in  36 hours -- if there were not any major hitches in the process.    Meanwhile, the ANC's election co-ordinator in southern  Natal,  Mr Nhlanhla Ngidi conceded that early indications did not give  his party a good showing. "As of now we are not doing very  well, the IFP lead is about 50 percent. But I think we are  steadily going to rise. We expect a lot of votes in mainly  urban areas and in southern Natal," he said. "Voting appears to  have generally gone along racial lines and we are planning to  get a majority among Africans," Mr Ngidi said, adding that the  National Party and the IFP appeared to have won the support of  minorities. But, he noted, only 100,000 votes had been counted  in Natal, of an ANC estimated 4.5 to 6 million voters.    The IFP's Mr Smith said: "Until you start reaching a far  higher percentage it's difficult to draw conclusions, but it  looks like we're on a winning streak." He said the IFP would  probably be "neck and neck" with the ANC in urban townships of  Natal.    The IEC reports that counting in certain smaller rural  stations in Natal like Babanango and Pongola was completed on  Sunday. Counting at the bigger stations was on Sunday night  still continuing at a steady rate. It's acknowledged that the  outcome in these areas could dramatically affect the final Natal  result.

headline:    Counting Problems Highlighted 
text:  BFN     [Tect] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Election tallies from the  crucial Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] counting centre from  which the main PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] result  is expected would probably not be completed until midnight on  Monday [2 May], IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]  Commissioner Helen Suzman, predicted on Sunday. She said the  task was huge, had started under chaotic circumstances and now  faced the problem that many counters were teachers who had to be  back at school on Monday.    Permission would be sought, particularly from the DET  [Department of Education and Training], for these teachers to  continue counting.    Asked about the chances of the election being declared free  and fair, she said she would like to quote Prime Minister John  Vorster to say the alternative was too ghastly to contemplate.  "But we have a useful adjective," she said. It was the word  "substantially". "I don't know whether anybody knows what it  really means but its a useful word."

Mrs. Suzman said she'd visited the Nasrec  [National Exhibition Center] Counting Center, and that dozens of  ballot boxes had not even been opened yet. She jokingly  referred to her job as commissioner as the most terrible job she  had ever had. She said that although it was the smallest  province, it was the most densely populated, and she'd only  received the assignment three weeks before the election had  started.

headline:    ANC Predicted To Win Orange Free State Vote 
text:  BFN     [By Jonathon Rees]     [Text] Bloemfontein May 1 SAPA -- With the African National  Congress looking set for a major victory in the [Orange] Free  State, the party's regional premiership candidate said it was  clear many whites had disregarded colour and voted ANC. "The  Orange Free State defied racial boundaries," said Patrick Terror  Lekota said on Sunday [1 May] night. This, and some black  support for formerly white parties, showed that voters in the  Free State had made decisions based on issues and not race, he  said.    This was not the view of NP [National Party] Free State  leader Kobie Coetsee, who said he was disappointed that voters  in SA's [South Africa's] first non-racial election had clearly  cast votes according to "the notion of colour".    Latest provisional figures from the Independent Electoral  Commission (IEC) on Sunday evening put the ANC well ahead with  65.9 per cent of votes polled, with the NP on 13.4 per cent.  The Democratic Party had 7.6 per cent and the Freedom Front 7.2  per cent. However, unofficial figures obtained from reliable  electoral sources, but not yet released by the IEC, indicated a  landslide ANC victory with over 80 per cent of the vote. IEC  officials said they expected a complete provisional result for  the Free State by midday on Monday.    A senior NP Free State official said the NP was disappointed  with its results and had expected to do better, especially in  the northern Free State goldfields where it concentrated its  campaign.    Reaction to the apparent ANC victory was muted in the  Bloemfontein city centre and surrounding townships on Sunday,  with residents appearing to go about their normal business. In  Freedom Square squatter camp, Jackson Mahope, 25, was watching a  soccer match Sunday afternoon and said he did not need to follow  the election results too closely. "I know who won," he said with  confidence.    Mr Lekota said many Free State whites had concentrated on  party politics and found in the ANC a program that suited them.  This would give the region a big advantage and should be  encouraged. The image of the Free State as a peaceful and  stable region should be maintained as the best way to empower  its new leadership to attract investment that was frightened  away from violence in Natal and the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging].    Mr Lekota was upbeat about the region's potential for growth  and said the ANC planned to urgently begin an intensive  education programme and give immediate attention to housing. He  urged ANC supporters to behave with discipline and calm and not  to loot or cause chaos in townships and city centres when they  celebrated the final poll results. "Lets celebrate and have  champagne bottles popping, but we must respect the rights now  enshrined in the interim constitution." He appealed to police  to watch out for troublemakers and not to allow the situation to  run out of control.    The poll results indicated that the Freedom Front [FF] had  reasonable support in the Free State, Mr Lekota said, which  meant the rightwing poll boycott had failed. The FF had not,  however, got as much support as it thought it had and did not  get enough votes for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland].    The ANC was concerned that its opposition should make a  reasonable showing in the election, Mr Lekota said, so a proper  government of national unity could be formed. If not, he would  suggest the new government should insist on close consultations  with other parties when making decisions.

They said they had  unsuccessfully asked for service contracts and information on  pay scales when employed two weeks ago.    After insisting on these late on Saturday afternoon, they  were provided by the IEC regional office in Kimberley. But the  pay offered was less than they had hoped for and the strike  began. An official said the pay offered was less than that  offered to officials in the main urban centres.    Telephone communications with the control room have been cut  and striking officials are not responding to faxes.    IEC officials at Springbok and Upington are also  dissatisfied  about not receiving service contracts or information on pay  scales.

The strike had also been called off in the Queenstown  sub-region and counting stations there were operational.    Chandler said there had been a late start to counting  throughout the province.    Some areas had transport problems in getting ballot boxes to  counting stations. Others had problems contacting IEC head  office for the permission required before they could begin  counting.    There had also been some problems in the reconciliation of  ballot papers in Port Elizabeth, and counting started a "little  later" there as well.

headline:    Tampering Suspected in Eastern Cape Township 
text:  BFN     [Text] Port Elizabeth April 30 SAPA -- Thirty-one ballot  boxes from KwaZakhele township in Port Elizabeth were isolated  pending further examination by police on Saturday [30 April] on  suspicion of electoral fraud. No finality on the charge of  tampering has materialised. Both the police and the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] have urgently requested the  attorney-general [AG] to travel from the judicial capital of  Grahamstown to Port Elizabeth to make a ruling.    The ballots from these boxes will not be counted until the  attorney-general reaches a decision, even though provisions for  counting are contained in the Electoral Act.    Police liaison officer Col Chris Maritz claimed this week  IEC  officials had broken the seals off "several" ballot boxes and  were scrutinising the ballots.    The IEC has repeatedly denied the allegation, though its  officials have remained reluctant to comment until their own  investigations were complete. A statement on the progress of the  inquiry is expected to be released within the hour.    The National Party's [NP] premier candidate in the Eastern  Cape, Dr Tertius Delport, formally requested the IEC on Saturday  night to declare the ballots contained in the 31 boxes null and  void. Dr Delport said the NP regarded the KwaZakhele votes as  invalid.    African Christian Democratic Party regional elections head  Ross Bradder said his party would abide by the AG's decision.    A declaration of the votes as null as void would not  necessarily be in the interests of a free or fair election,  however. "For the people who voted in good faith, their voice to  the nation is being ignored in that case.    "It is unfortunate that this has occurred because we believe  the election in the Eastern Cape has generally been run in a  peaceful and correct way."    Ballots from a second Port Elizabeth suburb may be suspect,  Mr Bradder announced later.    One ballot box from the Bethelsdorp area was separated from  counting on saturday when officials at the central counting  station noted it might have been resealed.    A discrepancy in serial numbers was spotted, said Mr  Bradder.    IEC comment was not immediately available.

Ms Jager said the commission was investigating several  complaints lodged with it, and a team of 100 attorneys had been  appointed to investigate alleged irregularities. Efforts would  also be made to determine to what extent irregularities would  influence the overall result in that region.    It was also announced at the news conference that a ballot  box containing 1,000 ballot papers was found at the  Steytlerville Police Station in the Eastern Cape.    Mr Khoza said the box would be counted separately.

The election has  had the effect of bonding our people together and healing the  wounds of the past, and making sure that South Africans emerge  out of an apartheid past into a democratic future with a great  deal of confidence.    The election itself has been a dynamo and an impetus with  regard to the task of nation building and reconciliation. We  believe that we have achieved a great deal out of this election.  A new mood is beginning to spread throughout our country. Our  people as a whole are beginning to feel postive after the  election. The levels of violence have been reduced very  drastically, there is a new confidence in the business community  in our country, and we also believe that a new confidence has  been infused into the future of our country and all our people  are looking forward to the installation of a new government with  a great deal of confidence.    The political tension between and among political parties  has  been reduced quite a lot, in spite of the fact that we are going  to be challenging each other regarding the election campaign.  The election itself has brought about a very positive and  constructive approach with regard to resolving the problems  which beset our country. Despite all the problems that were  experienced during the election campaign, we believe that the  election itself has been run on a free and fair basis, and we  would like to applaud the Independent Electoral Commission which  was charged with a mission impossible when it was appointed. It  was just impossible for any structure in our country to be able  to run the election in a very outstanding and successful way.  But we believe that what the IEC has achieved is outstanding  and we believe they should be applauded. We also want to voice  pour appreciation to the media in the way they have approached  the whole election process, in the way they have analyzed the  difficulties and interpreted them. They have actually also  infused a lot of confidence amongst our people, to encourage our  people to believe and to know that the election has been  successful.    There are problems that are being experienced in this point  in time with regard to counting. Only a few counting stations  have actually begun the counting process, but we believe that  the IEC is going to execute its tasks properly in the end. And  we call upon all our people to be patient with the IEC, to be  patient with the counters as they are resolving their problem.  And I would like to call on all of us to encourage them in the  difficult task that now lies ahead. The counting process is an  important task, an important aspect of the election process on  the whole, and they now have a very difficult task, and we need  to exercise patience, we need to have understanding, and we also  need to know that they were charged with a virtually impossible  task. But we have confidence that they are going to finalize  the task that they were given despite all the problems that they  are going through. Some results, we are made to believe have  already come through, particularly in the [Orange] Free State,  and they already indicate that the ANC is poised to achieve an  overwhelming victory. We want to wait for the total results to  come out before the ANC finally pronounces its attitude on these  results. We have confidence that results will start coming  through throughout the country later this afternoon, and we call  on everybody to have the understanding that is required in this  difficult situation, even if there is a delay, later into the  night or even tomorrow.    Yesterday we had a discussion with the IEC, and they  appraised us of some of the difficulties that they were bound to  experience, and we had a great deal of understanding and  appreciation, and we encourage them to move with some urgency to  resolve some of the difficulties that they have, but we have no  doubt whatsoever that they are the type who will at the end  execute those functions to deliver a result which will finally  confirm that indeed the elections were free and fair, and we  call upon all our people to look forward to the final result  being announced so that all of us, as South Africans, can  welcome and usher in a new dispensation which will be free of  oppression, free of apartheid, free of racial hatred.

headline:    ANC's Jordan on Expected `Big' ANC Victory 
text:  BFN     [News conference by ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan at the ANC   press center at the Carlton Center in Johannesburg -- live; at  1635 GMT TV 1 coverage is interrupted and broadcasting of the  conference continues on SABC CCV Television]    [Text] [Correspondent Estelle Pienaar] The ANC press  briefing is about to get under way. It will be addressed by Dr.  Pallo Jordan, assisting him is Carl Niehaus and also Marcel  Golding. Over to you, Pallo.    [Jordan] We are going into a very big ANC victory, and  though  there are at this point very limited figures available, based on  those figures we are projecting a majority of about 58 percent  for the ANC. We expect that we will be able to see that  reflected during the course of tonight in the figures produced  by the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]. We are  also expecting possible gains in Natal, the [Orange] Free State,  the Eastern Cape, and the Western Cape which could result in  that 58 percent figure, perhaps to 60 percent or more.    At this point we are still very confident that the current  ANC lead in the Northern Cape will hold, and based on our  returns, which are running slightly ahead of those that are made  available by the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], we  think that lead is going to be maintained. We are particularly  pleased about the strong showing of the Colored vote for the  ANC, and we think this is in part due to the fact that in the  Northern Cape Colored voters were evenly split in their support  between the NP [National Party] and the ANC, in sharp contrasts  to the trends that we have noted in the Western Cape. This is  particularly true for Colored voters in the rural areas where  our figures indicate that 4.5 percent rural vote went to the ANC  and against 55 percent of the NP.    The same was true of the urban areas such as Kimberley, and  we think that this reflects a change in the rest of the country  which differs very sharply from what occurred in the Western  Cape. We see the same trend also in Uitenhage, in Eastern Cape,  and other areas.    At this point in time the figures for the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] are exceedingly low because the  counting started so late. At this moment in time we are showing  a majority in excess of 64 percent, but we think that 60 percent  is closer to the actual showing we'll make. So one can expect  that 64 percent that we're seeing at present in the PWV might  well drop to around 60 percent. There are African rural areas,  many of whom were unfamiliar with the ANC at the beginning of  this campaign, and where we have struggled very hard to  familiarize people with the ANC and also to familiarize people  even with the symbol of the ANC and its slogans, showing a  particularly strong and high level of support for the ANC. In  areas such as the Northern Transvaal it runs as high as 98  percent among Africans in the rural areas. In the Eastern  Transvaal as high as 91 percent, and in the North West as high  as about 97 percent.    We think that this is extraordinary consolidation of the  support of the ANC in the rural areas in particular. The other  trend that we have noted in the election is that the Democratic  Party [DP] campaign does not seem to have paid out. We read  this in part as owing to the DP's concentration on an anti-ANC  campaign which has resulted in may white voters voting for the  NP at the expense of the DP. The DP in fact on current showing,  and we admit that these are early days, and most of the huge  urban areas have not yet reported back, but that showing at  present, it looks like the DP is going to fall into something  like forty, and will be replaced by the Freedom Front as the  second largest party among white voters.    The other trend which we have noted is that the PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] doesn't seem to be faring as well as  many had expected. There doesn't seem to be any identifiable  area of the country where the PAC has been able to show visible  support. This is true of areas where people expected it to make  a good showing such as the Transkei, the Northern Transvaal and  Eastern Cape. Early polling has showed that there are some gains  we are going to make in various parts of the Cape including the  Western Cape. We expect that by the time counting?closes in the  Western Cape you will note that the ANC total will increase by  about 4 or 5 points from the 24 percent that we're showing at  present. We will now attend to questions, thank you.    [Correspondent Callie Long] Dr. Jordan, four warrants have  been issued in connection with ballot papers that were destined  for the East Rand and Soweto. Do you regard this in a serious  light? Is it going to affect the outcome?    [Jordan] At this point in time one would not like to  speculate about that particular disclosure. We did mention a  few days ago that there were indications that there was mischief  afoot in this election, and we pointed specifically to the  non-arrivals of ballot papers especially in areas like the East  Rand and Soweto. We would like that very much in the hands of  the IEC to investigate, and we will defer (? some day). We  wouldn't like to speculate about the significance of that at  this point in time.    [Correspondent Sefakunyaka] Dr. Jordan, it is quite clear  that the National party and the African National Congress are  guaranteed a place in Parliament. Would you be prepared to  engage in the lottery of crystal ball gazing and tell us which  other parties you think might also come in, and how will this  affect a government of national unity?    [Jordan] The ANC commitment to establishing a government of  national unity remains unchanged and we will honor the terms of  the interim constitution that any party that gains 5 percent of  the ballot in the elections is entitled to sit in the government  of national unity. At this point in time the parties that  nationally will feature it would appear are the NP and the  Freedom Front perhaps. One is uncertain of what status the DP  will have at the end of counting, but as I say, we have not had  returns from the huge urban areas as yet, which might of course  change the picture very dramatically with respect to the DP.    [Unidentified correspondent] The PAC has virtually  disappeared from the political scene. Do you attach any  specific importance to that and what have you got for the  policies of the future?    [Jordan] Well, I would say that it is premature to make a  judgment about the significance of that. It is just something  that one is noting, because there had been high expectations of  the PAC's performance in certain parts of the country. I  wouldn't like to speculate about its significance at this point  in time.    [Correspondent Angie Caplianos] What is your reaction to the  slow flow of results coming in?    [Jordan] The slow flow of results, I suppose, is as a result  of some of the problems that the IEC has encountered. We are  aware, for example, that in an urban area such as Durban,  counting only started this morning. In the PWV, there seem to  have been a lot of teetthing problems all of yesterday and  counting started very late. In other urban areas, there were  instances of sit-down strike and go-slow by counters and that,  of course, has also [word indistinct] very negatively on the  rate at which we are receiving the returns. When we started  this conference, I don't think they had even reached the 20  percent mark yet, in terms of the votes that had been counted.  It means that the nail-biting will continue longer, but I don't  think we can help it.    [Correspondent] Mac Maharaj was quoted today as saying that  even if some parties didn't get 5 percent, they may be invited  to join in a government of national unity to increase stability  in the country. Is that an ANC position?    [Jordan] Now, the ANC has always been very insistent that we  want to make government as inclusive as possible and we want to  enhance stability and I am sure that that is the viewpoint which  could be looked at. Mac Maharaj at that point probably was  expressing a personal opinion, but it is one personal opinion  that runs counter to the thrust of ANC policy.    [Correspondent] It looks like the Freedom Front was able to  get a lot of support from the Afrikaner community. Now, you made  a commitment that if the Freedom Front got substantial support,  you would look again at the issue of a volkstaat [Afrikaner  homeland]. Are you still looking at that? Secondly, does that  change the attitude toward the Afrikaner community in a sense  that now there is a substantial support for a party which  actually does not want to be run or does not accept your  governnment, in a sense that they want to have their own  volkstaat.    [Jordan] No, our attitude to the Afrikaner community remains  unchanged. Afrikaners, like all other South Africans, are part  of this country. They have a home in this country and, in the  view of the ANC, they will always have a place in South Africa.  As to the issue of a volkstaat, our commitment to discuss the  issue of a volkstaat also remains unchanged. We have not said  that we will ever entertain the notion of a volkstaat. What we  have said is that we are prepared to discuss the idea of a  volkstaat with those who support it, with a view to ensuring  that those who want a volkstaat, and want to pursue a volkstaat  do not engage in unconstitutional activities or in armed  activity to attain their objectives. It doesn't mean that we  will ever embrace the notion of a volkstaat ourselves.    [Correspondent] I think one of the areas which is concerning  a lot of people is Natal. There have been reports of a number  of areas where ANC party officials were picked up, and I wonder  what happened. How many objections have actually really been  registered by the ANC?    [Jordan] The issues you raised have been placed before the  IEC and we have submitted quite a number of complaints with  respect to that with the IEC. In addition to that, we have also  placed a number of protests and brought to the notice of the IEC  other irregularities which you have not mentioned. We are aware  for example that there were a number of pirate voting stations  in various points of Natal. We've brought those to the notice  of the IEC. We've brought to the notice of the IEC other  irregularities, but we are leaving those matters very much in  the hands of the IEC because that is the machinery that was set  in place to deal with them.    [Correspondent] You seem to be conceding that you have no  chance of reaching 67 percent. I know you are worried that the  National Party will have a stranglehold on constitutional  changes in the future.    [Jordan] We are not conceding that we will not reach 67  percent. Every party goes into an election with a view to  winning as large a majority as it can win. It's like going into  a cricket match and saying, oh well, if you reach a century you  we will be content. You don't go in like that. You go in there  to knock the socks off the other team. If you make 2,000, good  luck to you. If your entire team comes out scoring ducks, too  bad; I mean, that's the way the game is played.    [Correspondent Gregory Katz] How would you explain the  party's relative lack of support in the Western Cape among the  coloreds?    [Jordan] I'm sure there are a whole number of reasons why we  were not able to win as much support in the colored community as  we had hoped for. One of those reasons I'm sure is a long past  during which the Western Cape, during the days of apartheid, was  regarded as the colored preference area which produced  competition for jobs, for scarce resources between African and  colored communities. I'm sure that is one explanation. But  certainly there are others as well.    [Correspondent] There is a very good showing of the Inkatha  party in KwaZulu/Natal. Is there a possibility that there will  be a national position for Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi (word  indistinct) the ANC's position?    [Jordan] The positions in the government of national unity  will not be determined by your performance in any particular  province. They will be determined by your performance in the  country as a whole. But as I said, the crux of ANC policy is  inclusivity; so we would not exclude the idea of the IFP being  part of a government of national unity even if the performance  does not measure up to the constitutional requirements.    [Correspondent] A similar question with respect to the  Freedom Front. They've made a reasonably -- at this point  anyway. [sentence as heard] Is there any likelihood that they  will be in a government of national unity? Related to that, how  does the ANC and its government expect to ensure minority rights?    [Jordan] To deal with the latter part of the question first,  we have never thought in terms of minority rights. We have  always thought in terms of individual rights. We've always said  that a constitution that guarantees the right of every South  African citizen, ipso facto protects the right of collectivity  of South African citizens, whether they are a majority or a  minority within the population. Secondly, the first part of  your question. It will be up to the Freedom Front, if it makes  that five percent ceiling threshold, whether or not it wants to  participate in the government of national unity. There is no  requirement that a party that scores that 5 percent threshold  should participate in the government. What the constitution  says is that it is eligible to participate. It's up to the  party whether it wants to exercise that option or not. So that  will be something you will have to put to the Freedom Front,  whether it wants to participate in a government of national  unity if it makes that 5 percent threshold.    [Correspondent] Will it be advised to do so by the ANC  government?    [Jordan] The constitution requires us to do so even if we  didn't want to do so, but we will invite it nonetheless.    [Correspondent] Just to follow up on the question about what  looks like the ANC did not achieve a two-thirds majority. Are  you disappointed in that result and what impact will this have  on the constitution-building and nation-building process down  the road?    [Jordan] Like I said, you go into a match to score the  highest score. So you are not going to be happy if you don't  score as highly as you would have liked to. It almost stands to  reason -- we would have been happier to make a two-thirds. Now  what impact that will have on the constitution-making process, I  don't think is of great significance because we had always  indicated quite clearly that whether or not we made a two-thirds  majority, we were not going to try to use that majority to  impose a constitution on the rest of the country. Even if we  had made a two-thirds or a three-quarters majority, we would  have striven to be as inclusive as possible. So that does not  change the manner in which we are going to behave in the  constitution-making body.    [Correspondent Brandon Templeton] Taking into consideration  the allegations of pirate voting stations and unavailability of  IFP stickers in KwaZulu/Natal -- does this mean that the ANC and  the IFP have come to some sort of agreement in the case of some  areas being...? [changes thought] Will it be possible to tell  whether a fair and free election was held in certain areas?    [Jordan] As I indicated, irregularities that have occurred,  that have come to our notice we have placed before the IEC.  It's the IEC's responsibility to deal with those  irregularities. We are not in the habit of making behind the  scenes deals with anyone about irregularities. [break in  transmission; news conference continues on CCV TV]    That was true not only in Natal, but true in many parts of  the country, especially on the first and second day of polling.  So, that is something specific to the Natal Province. It is a  problem, which I think is going to have to be resolved by the  political parties, together with the IEC. The issue of  reconciliation, I would think again, is something that has to be  resolved by the political parties, together with IEC.    [Correspondent] If we may return to the Western Cape for a  moment. By your own estimation at the end of the day, the ANC  may not get any more than 38 percent of the vote there. Can you  just give us a peep in the long term as to what ANC's policy  will be to, or strategy will be, to bring in more of the  so-called colored vote into the fold of the ANC?    [Jordan] The ANC will do what it has always done in the  past.  We fought this campaign on the issue of basic needs of South  African people. Well, we will continue to do that -- to place  the issues before the South African public.    [Correspondent Michael Havlett] A slightly technical  question: At what stage would you expect to make a claim that  you have won this election and that the ANC will be taking part?  [sentence as heard]    [Jordan, laughing] I wish I knew. I think you are all aware  that just last night we've been boogying on the second floor of  this hotel, because we anticipated that we would be able to make  that claim sometimes during the course of last night. Well, you  were disappointed. Everyone was disappointed. We are going to  boogie again tonight, but with far less expectation that we will  be able to make the claim tonight, but, you know, we will boogie  nonetheless, because we think it is about time we did. No,  really, I can't answer that question.    [Correspondent] Isn't there a point at which, you know, that  number of votes which you have got, which will guarantee you 201  seats in the assembly, or something of that sort? [sentence as  heard]    [Jordan] I suppose when we reach that point, we will be able  to do that, but when that will be, your guess is as good as mine  at this point.    [Correspondent] But that sets the trigger?    [Jordan] Something like that. Something like that.    [Correspondent] The ANC has emphasized non-racialism in its  policies. How bothersome is it that the vote broke down so much  along ethnic lines?    [Jordan] No, those have not broken down along ethnic lines.  There are certain parts of the country where that might be true,  but it's not the National Party, and we think that's very  significant. Even Northern Cape, for example -- most experts  anticipated that the ANC would not be able to win the Northern  Cape because of the large colored community there. Well, the  reverse has proved to be true.    [Correspondent] Do you consider the election as being free  and fair?    [Jordan] We would say on the whole free and fair, on the  whole free and fair.    [Correspondent] Would you give us some indication of what  Mr.  Mandela was doing today while he was watching the results?    [Jordan] He will come and boogie later when the results are  more firmly established. I don't think it will be proper to  talk about what the president is doing in private. [laughter]  He had some press engagements today.
