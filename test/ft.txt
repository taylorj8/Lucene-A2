headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome up ahead of results 
text:  PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome received a fillip ahead of tomorrow's interim results as a number of brokers turned positive on the stock. The shares rebounded from recent weakness to end 34 stronger at 978p. Agency broker James Capel was advising clients to buy Wellcome after analyst Mr Robin Gilbert recommended the stock at the house's morning meeting. He said international prescription audit figures showed sales of Retrovir would be up by 30 per cent against the same six-month period last year. Further support came from Hoare Govett, which moved its recommendation from hold to buy. Hoare's Mr James Culverwell believes the shares have underperformed too far against the sector since majority owner Wellcome Trust announced a planned share issue. Security house County NatWest also reiterated Wellcome's strengths at its morning meeting. The range of analysts' forecasts is between Pounds 235m to Pounds 243m, against Pounds 181m in the same period last year. Laporte placings Chemicals group Laporte fell in early trading as the placing of old and new shares commenced, but recovered later when the whole 22.5m found a home. The stock closed a net 10 better at 567p. Company broker BZW did the placing with large institutions at 533p per share in a package consisting of two old and one new. The shares were sold outside the market and turnover recorded on the Seaq electronic trading screens was only 1.1m. The 15.1m old shares represented an 8.7 per cent stake in the company acquired from Solvay, of Belgium. This follows reorganisation of Interox, jointly owned by Laporte and Solvay, which previously had 25 per cent of Laporte. The 7.6m new shares were issued to fund the Dollars 60m (Pounds 34.6m) acquisition of Rockwood, a private US chemicals company supplying the construction sector. P &amp; O pleases Relief greeted P &amp; O's maintained dividend and pre-tax profits, which were at the top end of analysts' expectations. The biggest sigh, however, was saved for the finalisation of the group's plans for its Pall Mall property venture with Chelsfield. Worries over the declining value of Pall Mall's property portfolio has been undermining the stock in recent weeks. Yesterday the shares jumped 32 to 416p in exceptional volume of 9.5m. The deal with Chelsfield gives P &amp; O control of Pall Mall, but takes group gearing from 45 to 70 per cent. Mr Clive Anderson at Smith New Court said the clarification of the Pall Mall situation cleared up a lot of the uncertainty surrounding P &amp; O's financial and trading position. 'This, together with the dividend, no warnings over future dividend payments, and better than expected profits, has given the market what it was looking for.' Mr Ian Wild at BZW was pleased with the group's service industry performance and its passenger volumes. He has raised his pre-tax profits forecast for 1992 by Pounds 30m to Pounds 310m. Smith is looking for Pounds 300m, a rise of Pounds 20m. Steel weakness British Steel came under renewed pressure as two more houses turned bearish on the stock. Large volume of 17m left the shares off 5 at 70p as worries over the group's final dividend continued to affect the market. Mr Alasdair Stewart, at Nikko Securities, reiterated his sell stance as he took account of recent comments by British Steel about trading conditions, and the dividend reduction undertaken by Bridon, a steel rope manufacturer, which reported its finals yesterday and which dropped 14 to 75p. James Capel downgraded British Steel. The broker is looking for losses of Pounds 80m to Pounds 100m this year and a final dividend of 4 1/2 p. The move comes after Monday's sell reiteration from Smith New Court. Steetley deals The bid battle for Steetley moved into the final straight. Two big blocks of Steetley shares were sold into the market, one a line of 3m shares and another of 5.5m. The deadline for acceptances is 1pm tomorrow. Most analysts are predicting that Redland will emerge as the winner. Its cash offer of 365p a share values Steetley at Pounds 617m and would create a building materials group with Pounds 2bn of combined annual turnover. In expectation of a Redland victory, Morgan Stanley has issued a buy note on the enlarged Redland group, analyst Mr Anthony Williams describing the group as 'an outstanding force in international building materials'. He expects Redland shares to reach 530p over 12 months. Yesterday Redland firmed 2 to 435p, while Steetley was steady at 366p in turnover of 10m. Speculation that Lasmo would announce a big disposal with its final results today died away and the shares closed unmoved at 204p after being up 4 initially. The company is adopting new accounting procedures and the figures could well be worse than most expectations. BP was 3 easier at 255p, with a seller of 3m shares at 255 1/2 p accounting for a large chunk of the 13m turnover. Some oil issues generated interest after agency broker James Capel's technical analyst pointed out that they were reaching support levels. Enterprise was one of them and the shares gained 9 to 389p. Glaxo forged ahead 32 to 814p on healthy turnover of 4.2m shares. Traders said Kleinwort Benson was aggressively on the bid ahead of a pharmaceuticals conference to be hosted by the house this week. Kleinwort divorced itself from the interest and cited continued US buying. Wessex remained the recovery stock among water companies, shrugging off political worries and gaining 12 to 387p on hopes of profits from waste disposal. Waste Management International, its partner in this venture, is about to float its shares in London and New York. Theme park operator Euro Disney tumbled 63 to 1590p after a downgrade by Goldman Sachs. BET received similar treatment from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and lost 2 to 129p. A big agency cross in BPB Industries by Cazenove saw 8.6m shares dealt both ways at 155p. BPB was off 2 at 157p. Publishers bounced back on opinion polls favourable to the Tories. Pearson advanced 15 to 785p and Reed International 12 to 511p. Costs of a loss-making joint venture with Geest knocked 24 off Associated Fisheries to 118p.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market rallies after new opinion poll 
text:  LONDON'S equity market danced to the tune of the latest opinion poll and more than recaptured the ground lost on Monday, the FT-SE Index ending a trading session of sharply increased turnover 17.7 higher at 2,458.7. Shrugging aside worries and press comment about the trade deficit, which again had little effect on sterling or gilts, share prices gave an immediate and positive response to a Harris poll published in the Daily Express which confounded most of the weekend political surveys. Harris indicated a five-point lead for the Conservatives over Labour, reversing evidence from the weekend polls which gave a clear lead to Labour. In the background to a broadly based upturn in market sentiment was a series of positive developments involving leading UK companies. Among these were better than expected results from P &amp; O, with figures from the shipping to building group accompanied by a reorganisation of its joint venture with Chelsfield. The deal put an end to long-running nervousness among P &amp; O shareholders about the property venture. Sentiment in the shipping group's shares was given a further fillip by news that Lord Sterling, P &amp; O's chairman, had spent around Pounds 1m in buying a block of 250,000 shares. The market opened on a much brighter note with the Footsie 14.8 up, buoyed by the overnight opinion poll indicating a lead for the Conservatives over Labour. A bout of selling pressure, triggered by an opening discount on the Footsie future to the cash market, saw prices falter, before resuming their upward path over the lunch period. The future remained at a discount to the underlying cash market for the rest of the session. At least two programme trades were operated during the morning period. The early afternoon saw another wave of local and overseas buying in the market, driving shares further ahead and pushing the Footsie to the day's high of 2,462.3, up 21.3 points. Thereafter, intermittent bouts of profit-taking, and selling by marketmakers unwilling to hold large lines of stock on their books ahead of the next series of opinion polls, took the edge off the market, which ended about four points below the day's best level. There were suggestions around the market towards the close that the next batch of opinion polls would show the Tory lead in the Harris poll to have been no more than a blip. Traders said one of the day's more encouraging features had been an expansion in turnover. The Seaq system revealed volume of 493.2m shares, well ahead of Monday's 370.6m. Drug issues were among the market's outstanding performers, with Glaxo and Wellcome prominent in the wake of keen support from US institutions. Laporte, the chemicals group, rose strongly after announcing that it was buying the US group Rockwood in a deal financed by the placing of a large block of Laporte shares. Following the redesign of the FT, Monday's yield on the FT-SE 100 Index, normally carried in the markets panel on our front page, was omitted yesterday. The figure was 5.06.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading 
text:  LIVELY trading in a tight range saw the futures market slightly down yesterday, as UK election worries continued to undermine confidence, writes Christopher Price. While the March FT-SE contract opened at 2,450, trading was initially unsettled by technical problems still being experienced by the market following Monday's merging of the Liffe and LTOM. An opinion poll showing the Conservative party ahead yesterday was largely discounted by futures traders, and March was sold down - mainly by County NatWest - to 2,438 in early trading. Aggressive buying by one trader then helped it to rally, and by midday it had reached 2,456. The contract drifted off in quiet afternoon trading and at one stage March was at a discount of seven points to the cash market. It rallied later, but weakness was noted in after-hours' trading as opinion poll worries returned. March closed at 2,455, up 11 from the previous session but at a two-point discount to the cash market. Volume was a dull 6,390 lots. In the traded options market, turnover came to 30,507 contracts. The Euro-FTSE was the most heavily traded at 2,839 lots, followed by British Steel and Hillsdown.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Decline in car sales helps push Dow lower 
text:  Wall Street NEWS OF weak mid-March domestic car sales depressed market sentiment yesterday as investors continued to hold back amid uncertainty about the short-term direction of share prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 11.18 at 3,260.96. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.03 to 408.88, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks declined 3.15 to 618.68. Turnover on the New York SE was a moderate 192m shares. The release of mid-March car sales figures disappointed the market, which had hoped they would show further evidence of a recovery in consumer spending. After the biggest manufacturers had reported, it was clear that the annual selling rate based on the 10-day period earlier this month was below 6m cars, some way short of the 6.2m rate expected by the market, and an indication of the continued weakness in consumer demand. Motor shares were in the limelight following the sales data. General Motors fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 3/8 after reporting US-made car sales in mid-March were 6.1 per cent lower than at the same period a year earlier. Ford dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 on news of a 5.4 per cent decline in car sales in the same period, while Chrysler edged Dollars 1/2 lower to Dollars 17 3/8 on a 26 per cent fall in sales. The one bright spot was a rise in truck sales over the period for Ford and Chrysler. K Mart, one of the country's biggest retailers, improved Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 after announcing a two-for-one stock split and an increase in quarterly dividend. Gap firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 in spite of news that Mr Millard Drexler, the retail group's president, had sold  1/2 m shares in February for about Dollars 25.6m. A Gap spokesman said the sale was part of the normal div-ersification of the president's portfolio. BancOne rose another Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 as investors continued to react positively to the regional banking group's Dollars 782m purchase of Team Bancshares, the sixth largest bank in Texas. Sterling Chemical rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 4 3/4 on its agreement to acquire Tenneco's pulp chemicals operations in Canada. Tenneco eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 . SPS Transaction Services appreciated Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 after broking house Alex Brown &amp; Sons initiated coverage of the recently floated company with a 'buy' recommendation. Among over-the-counter stocks, Microsoft weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 127 1/2 after stating that it would be acquiring Fox Software. SunMicrosystems dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 29 1/2 on the day that the company reduced prices on its three-dimensional display workstations and its microprocessor server family of products. Canada TORONTO ended slightly lower as the cash flow difficulties at Olympia &amp; York Developments kept market participants cautious. A trader said: 'That hanging over us as well as the constitutional (uncertainty) is really killing our market.' The composite index finished 5.8 down at 3,437.8. Declines led advances by 323 to 222 after volume of 32.9m shares. 'Obviously they are going to do something to help them (Olympia &amp; York) restructure. It just puts a big pall over our financial institutions,' the trader added.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Bank calms market 
text:  THE Bank of England made its desire to calm the market clear from the outset yesterday, supplying plentiful early liquidity. 'The Bank were very helpful on Monday, and they were very helpful again today,' said one dealer. The Bank's morning forecast was for a shortage of around Pounds 750m, which it immediately sought to relieve with offers to purchase bills across all four bands. It bought a total of Pounds 709m of bills, including Pounds 640m of Band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. 'The Bank probably didn't need to do an early round,' said one dealer. Without an election campaign, 'they probably would have waited till lunchtime' to offer relief. The Bank's action resulted in a slight easing of rates: just before lunch, three-month money was trading at 10 13/16 - 3/4 , down from Monday's 10 7/8  -13/16 . There were no Bank operations at lunchtime, but in the afternoon, the Bank revised its estimate of the shortage to around Pounds 800m, and bought a further Pounds 100m of band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Three-month money closed at 10 13/16 -, a further easing. The June sterling contract closed at 89.05, not far from the day's high of 89.11 and up from Monday's close of 88.97. Overnight rates dropped as low as 7 per cent during the day, but closed at 10 3/8 - 1/8 , a level which was 'historically, almost giving money away,' said one dealer. 'The market is not so much discounting a half-point rise after the election as discounting the possibility of a much bigger rise if Labour forms a minority government,' said Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Fears that a Labour government might face a weakening pound increased the risk of a significant rise in interest rates - so that, allowing for the electoral probabilities, 'the market is starting to discount half of that.' The Bundesbank announced that German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 8.5 per cent in February after a 9.0 per cent rise in January. The Bundesbank's 1992 M3 growth target is 3.5 to 5.5 pct. German call money remained unchanged at 9.65-70 per cent as tax payments continued to put upwards pressure on rates. The Bundesbank set a tender for a 28-day securities repurchase agreement. A DM 5.5bn facility at rates of mostly 9.45 per cent expires today.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar fails to sustain gains 
text:  THERE was an early rise in the dollar against the D-Mark yesterday, as the market reacted to gloomy predictions from former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and news of a radiation leak at a Russian nuclear plant. The US currency opened in European trading at DM1.6720, compared with a DM1.6712 close in Asian trading and the DM1.6667 at which New York finished. Mr Mark Austin of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's London office said: 'Any bad news from the Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) tends to support the dollar and undermine the D-Mark.' The rally did not last, however. One US bank trader told the Reuter news agency: 'The dollar gain was mostly down to interbank players trying to relieve the boredom, and the real long-term customers showed absolutely no interest.' By mid-morning the dollar had eased to DM1.6667. As Mr Neil MacKinnon of Yamaichi Securities in London pointed out, the dollar had again failed to break through the important DM1.6720 resistance level. For it to make the breakthrough, he said, 'the market really needs firm evidence that the beginnings of a US recovery, signalled in a number of indicators, are sustainable'. Once that happens, he says, 'we could see a test of DM1.7400 within three months'. The US unit ended European trading at DM1.6670, mildly below Monday's European close of DM1.6700. In New York the dollar eased further to finish at DM1.6637. Against the yen, the dollar retained its gains slightly better. It finished in Europe at Y133.70, down marginally from the Y133.80 at which it ended Tokyo trading and unchanged from the Y133.70 of Monday's close to European trading. Sterling continued to display some evidence of strength against the D-Mark, but remained stuck firmly at the bottom of the ERM. It opened the day at DM2.8675, and at one point touched DM2.8683. Later, however, as rumours about forthcoming opinion polls suggested bad news for the Conservative party, the pound lost its gains and ended at DM2.8625, compared with Monday's DM2.8650. Against the dollar, sterling stood at Dollars 1.7200, up from Monday's Dollars 1.7150. On the Bank of England trade-weighted index, the UK currency ended the day at 90.0, unchanged from the previous close. Several analysts pointed out that it is common for pressure in EMS currencies to show up not so much in the exchange rate but in short-term interest rates. Thus, they argued, there was no necessary contradiction between the relative firmness of sterling and the tension displayed in the money markets about a possible Labour victory.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Investors and traders relieved by European recovery 
text:  YESTERDAY brought some respite to the battered European government bond markets. After the bad news of recent days - which have seen closing yields on 10-year German bonds climbing above 8 per cent for the first time since January 3 and yields on comparable French bonds hitting a high for the year at more than 8.75 per cent - the relief among traders and investors alike was clear. The recovery seemed to be driven as much by technical factors as by any sense that the mark-down in prices had been overdone, observers said. In the German and French futures markets, the fact that many traders had gone short was said to have accounted partly for some sharp upward swings during the day. UK gilts meanwhile, continued to follow the mood of the political opinion polls in the run-up to the general election. Underlying economic factors seemed to have little immediate influence on the day's trading. IN GERMANY, M3 money growth during February was confirmed at 8.5 per cent, close to the level indicated at the start of the week and down from the 9 per cent growth in January. The fall in M3 brought little consolation to the government bond market, where a greater reduction had been looked for in some quarters - particularly when the figure is set against the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent for the year. The market is far more interested in the latest German inflation figure, due later this week: one analyst said yesterday this was likely to show inflation peaking at 4.7 per cent. Early weakness in the bond market was reversed sharply in the afternoon, due both partly to technical factors and partly to a confident start in the US. The yield on 10-year government bonds ended the day at 8.024 per cent, down from Monday but still well up on the beginning of the month, when it stood at around 7.85 per cent. FRENCH government bonds recovered strongly from Monday, in the process narrowing the yield spread against German bonds. At 73 basis points, this had opened up to its widest since last summer and well outside the recent trading range: yesterday, it closed back to 70 basis points. Figures released yesterday revealed the French trade surplus had narrowed to FFr407m in February, from a revised FFr3.53bn in January. In a busy day on the futures market, with 167,000 lots traded, the June contract closed up one-third of a point on the day, at 107.40. A sharp bear squeeze, with some traders caught with short positions, accounted for much of the rise, traders said. The yield on 10-year bonds closed at 8.72 per cent, down from 8.77 per cent on Monday. AFTER a quiet opening, news of weak car sales and strong demand for the afternoon auction of two-year notes sent US Treasury prices soaring yesterday and pushed the yield on the long bond back below 8 per cent. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up 1 1/32 at 100 19/32 , yielding 7.941 per cent. The two-year note was also markedly firmer, up  5/16 at 99 11/32 , to carry a yield of 5.720 per cent. At first, trading lacked a firm direction in the absence of economic figures, and activity was subdued amid concern about the impact of fresh supply on the market. News of weak mid-March car sales, however, boosted sentiment just before noon, but it was not until after the sale of Dollars 14.75bn in two-year notes that prices took off. There was good demand for the new issue, especially from dealers. The sale was completed at an average yield of 5.85 per cent and with a high bid/cover ratio, both of which were better than market expectations. THE UK government bond market continued to anticipate the outcome of the general election on April 9. A Harris opinion poll indicating a five-point lead for the Conservative party brought some cheer back to the market, which duly market longer-dated gilts up several points on the day. 'All we're doing is trading opinion polls,' one observer said. The benchmark 9 per cent gilts due 2011 rose  7/32 of a point on the day, at 95 3/8 , giving a yield of 9.52 per cent. A rise of similar proportions was recorded by the 11 3/4 per cent gilts due 2003/07, which ended the day at around 112  17/32 , a yield of some 9.8 per cent. At these levels, the market is already largely discounting a victory by the opposition Labour party, or a result which leaves no clear majority party, traders said. But, most agree yields could yet breach 10 per cent if a Labour victory looks likely. JAPANESE government bond prices hardly shifted yesterday, as the end of the Japanese fiscal year continued to suppress activity in Japan. Despite the expectation of a discount rate cut, the market appears to lack direction. The no 129 benchmark issue ended unchanged at 105.88. With no sign of investor demand, traders, many of whom are holding long positions, are apt to stay out of the market. However, the outlook could improve, if cash balances are allocated to bonds once the new financial year is properly under way.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Eskom returns to market with five-year DM300m deal 
text:  ESKOM, the South African electricity utility, yesterday launched its first public issue in the international bond market since 1985, raising DM300m, five-year funding in a deal lead-managed by Commerzbank. The bonds were sold mostly to retail investors in continental Europe, following the pattern of other recent issues by South African borrowers. The deal is the fourth since South Africa returned to the public bond market last September and follows D-Mark and Ecu issues by the government and a DM200m issue in February by the Development Bank of Southern Africa. The return of South African borrowers to the Euromarket has not been without controversy: in November, the Independent Development Trust, a cross-party health, education and housing charity, postponed a Dollars 200m deal following opposition from the African National Congress. Bankers said yesterday the referendum of white South Africans this month, which resulted in a vote in favour of political reform, would encourage wider international participation in future bond issues. The syndicate of 23 banks participating in yesterday's deal was dominated by German firms. Among the non-German participants were Standard Chartered, Paribas, Credit Lyonnais, Credit Commercial de France, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Kredietbank. When the government launched its DM400m, five-year issue in September, only three non-German banks participated: Paribas, Swiss Bank Corporation and Kleinwort Benson. The Eskom paper carries a full government guarantee, a policy which is likely to continue in future issues by South African borrowers. The 10 per cent bonds were issued at 101, to yield 150 basis points more than German government bonds. The governments D-Mark issue was launched at a spread of 175 basis points more than bunds. Part of the proceeds of yesterday's issue will be used to refinance an outstanding DM150m deal which falls due on April 1, said Mr Mick Davis, chief financial officer. The remainder has been swapped into rand, although at a rate no better than Eskom can achieve from the domestic South African bond market, Mr Davis added. Eskom has another DM100m issue falling due on September 15. Mr Davis said this would be refinanced with another international issue, although the company may issue in the Ecu or Eurodollar markets next time. Other South African borrowers in an unofficial queue to launch international bonds include Transnet, the transport group, and the Office of Post and Telecommunications, both of which have outstanding foreign currency bonds maturing later this year. Elsewhere, the poor tone of government bond markets continued to deter potential Euromarket borrowers. Syndicate officials said intermediaries and investors were focusing on the outcome of this week's US Treasury refunding operations before committing funds to the market.

text:  CAROLCO, the troubled independent Hollywood film studio, yesterday said it had secured Dollars 73.8m of financing from its foreign investors and has access to an additional Dollars 23m in new bank loans, which should be sufficient to continue operating. Carolco's foreign minority shareholders include Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of Italy and Canal Plus of France. Carolco, along with other independent film companies such as Orion Pictures, has been caught in a financial squeeze. In December, Carolco cut its staff of 200 by 25 per cent and said it was considering reducing the number of deals with film-makers. Problems at the company, which started mounting last summer, forced it to cut off talks aimed at acquiring a 46 per cent stake in the Live Entertainment home video supplier in November. Carolco still holds a 53 per cent stake in Live. The company, which is best know for its Terminator and Rambo films, was in technical default on Dollars 172m of bank loans for much of last year. The details of yesterday's financing and restructuring are not significantly different from a package arranged two months ago, although the amount of funding has increased. In January, Carolco said it had secured Dollars 45m of financing and a deferral on Dollars 10m of debts from its US and foreign lenders. The major differences include the Dollars 23m in new loans that Carolco's banks have made available to the company. Carolco's bankers include Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank and Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland. In addition, Carolco's investors have agreed to fund up to Dollars 13.8m of potential bank collateral shortfalls. While the arrangement should help Carolco keep operating in the short-term, the company said it 'anticipates that its operations could require additional sources of funds.'

text:  GROUPE Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company headed by financier Mr Albert Frere, pushed up consolidated profits by 23 per cent to BFr7bn (Dollars 205m) last year, helped by a heavy increase in interest and dividend receipts. The group reported profits of BFr5.7bn for 1990. The directors have proposed increasing net dividend from BFr140 to BFr142.5 per share. Although the increase is smaller than many analysts had expected, GBL denied it had held back the payout in order to add to its substantial cash reserves. Interest on reserves and dividends increased from less than BFr100m to BFr1.6bn last year. 'The (cash) amount is clearly comfortable and we could make a large investment without having to run to the banks,' said a spokesman, who refused to give details of the group's finances. GBL, which owns stakes in many of Belgium's largest industrial and financial groups, is said by some analysts to have nearly BFr30bn of cash on its balance sheet, following a number of judicious stake sales over the last two years. In 1991, GBL sold part of its stake in Royale Belge, the Belgian insurance company, and Banque Internationale a Luxembourg. However, capital gains of BFr3.2bn were broadly the same as in 1990. The figures, announced after the close of the Brussels stock market, were in line with analysts' most recent expectations, although a number of brokers had downgraded their forecasts since the beginning of the year following poor results from some companies in which GBL has a holding. The group said the bulk - about BFr5.1bn - of its final profit was accounted for by interest, dividends and GBL's share in the results of other companies.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM launches laptop in colour 
text:  INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) has introduced a laptop computer with colour screen. It has also launched two lower-priced notebook computers. IBM's colour laptop incorporates a 10.4-inch flat active matrix colour display, jointly developed by IBM and Toshiba in Japan. It will be manufactured in Japan to avoid dumping duties imposed by the US government last year on Japanese-built active matrix displays. Such duties are not imposed on assembled units. The notebook-sized computers, called PS Notes, have monochrome screens and weigh just over six pounds. With these product announcements, IBM aims to shrug off a series of mistakes in the rapidly growing market for portable personal computers, where it has trailed competitors. The PS/2 Color Laptop is based on a 386SX microprocessor and incorporates an 80MB hard drive. It is priced in the US at Dollars 5,995. Bigger and heavier than the notebook computers, the colour laptop weighs 11 pounds, due primarily to the screen technology. The PS/2 Model N51 SLC is built around IBM's own version of the 386 microprocessor, which the company claims is up to 80 per cent faster than standard versions. It also comes with an 80MB hard drive. The US price is Dollars 3,295. The PS/2 Model N51 SX is aimed at price-sensitive customers and is based on a standard 386SX microprocessor with a 40MB hard drive. It is priced at Dollars 2,250 in the US, placing it in direct competition with a myriad of IBM-compatible notebook models. Sun Microsystems Computer, the leading US computer workstation manufacturer, yesterday cut by nearly 30 per cent the prices of its high-end workstations for three-dimensional imaging. The move is expected to step up pressure on such competitors as Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment, IBM and Silicon Graphics to make similar price adjustments. Sun also cut prices on 19-inch monitors for all its workstations. Pacific Bell, one of the largest regional telephone companies in the US, has formed an alliance with IBM and Northern Telecom to develop and field test 'multimedia' telecommunications network services. The goal of the alliance is to create services that would enable telephone customers to communicate with data, video, images and voice as easily as they can now place a phone call. Focusing initially on expanding applications of existing network technology, the companies are also planning a second phase of joint research on making use of new broadband network technologies. As envisioned, multimedia services would allow users simply to dial others on their PCs. The parties could, for example, see images of each other on their screens and use a shared computer screen 'window' to edit documents jointly. In a separate move, Northern Telecom - Canada's biggest telecommunications equipment producer - has formed a joint venture, Northern Telecom de Espana, to sell telephones, switching equipment, business communications systems and data networks in Spain, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. NT owns 50 per cent of the new company; Agroman Inversiones owns 37.5 per cent; and Radiotronica 12.5 per cent. Both Spanish partners are members of the Banesto group.

It had already reported a 1991 loss of CDollars 75.9m, (USDollars 63.7m), or CDollars 1.12 a share, on revenues of CDollars 2.8bn. The 1991 results included pre-tax, non-recurring charges and write-downs of CDollars 44.4m. Capital spending was expected to rise to about CDollars 50m in 1992 from CDollars 38.5m last year, while long-term debt stood at CDollars 370.8m at the year-end. Abitibi, in its annual report, said: 'The outlook for the newsprint industry in North America is not expected to improve appreciably in 1992 unless there is a marked increase in US consumption or further mill or machine closures.' It added some improvement in markets were expected in 1993. 'We are now facing the same (newsprint) price wars and ferocious competition offshore that we have seen in domestic markets.' It expects further price weakness in overseas markets this year.

But Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said the company's used car sales and after-sales division performed well as customers delayed new purchases. Following the 5 per cent reduction in new car tax announced in the budget, and with the uncertainty of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report removed, Mr Finn anticipated an improvement in new car sales from August and said the outlook was promising. Turnover fell to Pounds 168.3m (Pounds 174.4m). Operating profits were dragged lower by higher administrative expenses, reflecting increased costs managing franchises acquired during the year. Interest charges dropped to Pounds 830,000 (Pounds 2.18m), helped by the proceeds of last June's Pounds 11m rights issue. The company held net cash of some Pounds 2.1m at the year end. More shares in issue pushed earnings down to 12.1p (15.1p). However, the directors are recommending a final dividend of 4p to make a total of 6p, an 11 per cent increase. Mr Finn said although used car volumes were down, margins improved. This was because consumers delayed new purchases, leading to a shortage of low mileage used cars on the market.

text:  ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction company, yesterday reported a 44 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1991, broadly in line with market expectations. Pre-tax profits fell to Dollars 137m (Pounds 79m) against Dollars 244m on sales up 9 per cent at Dollars 1.25bn. Earnings per share fell from Dollars 1.93 to Dollars 1.04. The company repeated its statement that it would not pay an ordinary dividend until the 1992 results at the earliest in line with the policy of reducing debt. Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, forecast that earnings per share would increase in 1992. 'Not many UK companies would go out on a limb and say that,' he said. Regarding ADT's convertible preference shares which fall due in 1994, Mr Ashcroft said: 'The last quarter of 1994 is two and a half years away, we do not see it as a problem.' The pre-tax figure was again boosted by profits from foreign exchange gains of Dollars 20m, down from last year's Dollars 27m. The gain from long term investments fell from Dollars 22.7m to Dollars 11.6m, including losses on the sale of stakes in Christies International and Quoteplan. The figures included a Dollars 57.9m charge above the line, most of which was due to interest as debt rose as the group crystallised losses on associate investments. Debt finished the year at Dollars 1.04bn, down from Dollars 1.1bn, but Mr Ashcroft said that taking away the value of quoted investments and liquid assets, gearing at the year-end would be about 100 per cent on shareholders' equity of Dollars 600m. At the operating level, profits from security services fell slightly, from Dollars 133m to Dollars 131m, while auctions increased profits from Dollars 64.3m to Dollars 71.8m.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / Labour would delay minimum wage proposals until next year 
text:  THE LABOUR party would not implement its proposed minimum wage until next year and would then stick to the rate of Pounds 3.40 an hour rather than the original policy formula of half of median male earnings. The delay and the lower rate would mean that the number of people affected by the minimum wage would be substantially lower, the wage bill cost for employers markedly down, and the expected job losses from the measure reduced. Mr Paul Gregg, senior research fellow at the National Institute of Social and Economic Research, yesterday calculated that if the Pounds 3.40 rate were not introduced until April next year, the number of people covered would be 2.3m compared with nearly 4m if the median male earnings formula were implemented next month. He said the corresponding increase on the wages bill would be Pounds 2.2bn compared with Pounds 3.4bn, and the number of job losses would be 100,000 compared with the 150,000 the institute had originally calculated. Two Labour frontbench spokesmen have confirmed that, if Labour wins, the minimum wage is unlikely to be introduced before April 1993. Mr Neil Kinnock, the party leader, has stated that the initial rate would be Pounds 3.40, the figure in Labour's manifesto. Sticking to the formula of half median male earnings would, by April 1993, produce a figure close to Pounds 3.80. Labour leaders stress that they remain committed to the formula but have accepted the argument of economic advisers that the seriousness of the recession and higher-than-expected unemployment make a short delay in implementation sensible. Union officials are unlikely to complain publicly before the election. However, implemention at the lower level could build up pressure for a large catch-up, to the level of the formula, in 1994. Workers most affected by the minimum wage are in hotels and catering, retailing, textiles and clothing, and contract cleaning. The main worry for many empl-oyers is the knock-on effect if differentials are to be maintained. Engineering pay rises at four-year low, Page 8

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / Radiation leak renews safety fears over Russian reactors 
text:  FEARS over the safety of nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union were revived yesterday following a leak of radiation from a Russian nuclear power station at Sosnovy Bor, 60 miles west of St Petersburg. The leak initially registered three on the seven-point scale of seriousness devised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to classify nuclear accidents. The 1986 Chernobyl explosion was rated level seven. The state nuclear inspectorate, Gosatomnadzor, said radioactive iodine and inert gases leaked into the reactor's machine room early yesterday and were transmitted by the ventilation system into the outside atmosphere. The agency said an emergency control system immediately came into operation and the stricken reactor had then been closed and was being cooled. There were conflicting reports about the significance of the accident. Mr Yuri Rogozhin of Gosatomnadzor said the 'degree of the incident is serious, with possible consequences for the environment and the population'. But there was 'no comparison' between the incident and the Chernobyl disaster, although the Sosnovy Bor reactor was of the same type as that at Chernobyl. Mr Sergei Galkin, deputy chief engineer at Sosnovy Bor in charge of safety, told the official news agency Itar-Tass that the leak of radioactive gases 'did not exceed the sanitary norms for nuclear power installations'. Nuclear safety organisations in Sweden and Finland said there had been no rise in radioactive levels on their monitors. Mr Matti Vuorinen, head of the Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety, said the leaks appeared to pose no threat to residents. Western governments and environmentalists expressed concern over safety standards for reactors in the former Soviet Union and renewed calls for unsafe plants to be shut. The incident also highlighted concern, especially in neighbouring countries, over the future of ageing reactors kept in service in republics which have no alternative sources of power - especially at a time of falling supplies of oil, gas and coal. Swedish inspectors who visited Sosnovy Bor noted that two of its four reactors lacked safety fixtures to prevent radiation leaks. Nuclear worries, Page 2 Editorial comment, Page 18

Since Mr Pitman assumed his post in 1983, Lloyds's shares have outperformed the banking sector by nearly 90 per cent. Yesterday's announcement about the chairmanship also brought confirmation that he is to stay until 1995, so presumably the future is assured until then. But there is one caveat. Some might argue that Lloyds' dalliance with Midland meant Mr Pitman had lost his deftness of touch. In fact a merger could just about have been justified by the scope for cost-saving. Alternative propositions will need an even more critical look. In the long run, shareholders would be more grateful for surplus funds to be paid out in dividends than frittered away on a reckless buying spree.

The move could yet look silly if the cycle suddenly turned - but then sceptics said the same about Mr Newmarch's humiliating exit from the estate agency game, and who is now to say that he was wrong? Even in better times broker-related general insurance is too small to make decent returns. Like Legal and General, the Pru would no doubt be happy if its transformation to a purer life and pensions business could be speeded up even more. Last year's somewhat disappointing 9 per cent pre-tax profits rise, for example, bore the mark of increased losses from the non-life side of the reinsurance group, Mercantile and General. It is too early to be alarmist, but one wonders just how long the sizeable prior year claims will recur. The Pru is putting its substantial weight behind M and G for the moment, but the company may yet provide Mr Newmarch with his next chance to swing the axe.

text:  Judging by yesterday's results, Laporte has not been quite as successful in defying recession this time as it was a decade ago. But a 6 per cent fall to Pounds 97m in pre-tax profits for 1991 was not a bad performance: the figure would have been flat had it not been for a Pounds 6m hit from the permanent loss of one customer in its absorbents division. It is nonetheless striking to recall that 18 months ago the market confidently thought Laporte would be making Pounds 145m last year. It is just as well the group has insignificant gearing and that the increased dividend was comfortably covered. The logic of separating from Solvay was accepted when the break-up of their Interox joint venture was announced last year. Yesterday's details suggest both sides achieved their objective, so Laporte was ungracious towards its partner in suggesting that Interox had become a drag on profits growth. Its main reason to separate was to concentrate on high-margin specialty chemicals, a strategy taken a step further by the acquisition of Rockwood, a US pigments producer. Investors must take the numbers on trust, but earnings from Rockwood should more than offset the loss of the full contribution from Interox. All the same, Laporte needs economic recovery if progress this year is to be anything more than steady. That outlook is properly reflected by the average rating of its shares.

That said, investors are entitled to feel a mite puzzled that revaluations of the newly divided Pall Mall empire and other group real est-ate produced so little bad news. P &amp; O has little exposure on the development side, to be sure, but the negligible writedown of the Bovis land bank and mere 4 per cent balance sheet hit for investment properties certainly contrasts with experience elsewhere. This would matter more if gearing, which, thanks to the Chelsfield deal is back at 70 per cent, was steaming ahead like it was before the rights issue last summer. Falling capital expenditure and sizeable property sales over the next two to three years, though, promise to relieve this pressure in the medium term. In retrospect the timing of Lord Sterling's huge investment programme might have been a lot better, but even at last night's 416p close the shares are an attractive recovery play. Not many companies with cyclically depressed profits stand on a lower than market average multiple; a 10 per cent yield implies caution on the dividend front which does not now appear justified. Real glimmers of economic recovery, however, will have to appear before the market is convinced.

text:  It is perplexing that German bond yields should suddenly be back over 8 per cent. There was never any doubt that money supply growth - 8.5 per cent in February - would be slow to return to its target range or that inflation would be pushing up towards 5 per cent this month. Perhaps investors feared the Bundesbank would tighten further after Friday's 9 per cent settlement for heating workers. But Bonn is taking a tough line on public sector pay and it would be uncharacteristic for the central bank to react to each twist in the round. The simple explanation seems to be the market has finally given up hope of lower money rates in the foreseeable future. The prospect that the yield curve will remain sharply inverted thus adds to the attraction of cash. German bankers report customer time deposits are growing sharply. Curiously, though, money leaving the German bond market does not seem to be seeking higher long-term returns elsewhere in Europe. The yield curve is inverted elsewhere, of course, while the UK and French markets have political worries of their own. But even in Denmark, where inflation is only 2.3 per cent, the spread over German bond yields has widened by some 30 basis points this year. That suggests deeper doubts over currency union and yield convergence. If the Bundesbank really is determined to stay the course, some of its partners may eventually decide they have no choice but to realign.

Although Tec directors in principle support the government's contention that employers should shoulder more of the cost of training, they voiced their concern over cuts in state funding to training programmes in 1992-93 and said the quality of programmes could be affected. However, most Tec directors showed broad satisfaction with the progress of Tecs, which were launched two years ago by Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, to change attitudes towards training in the UK . In a big survey of board members of conducted by The Financial Times, 20 per cent of the private sector respondents - who make up the majority on Tec boards - said Labour would have a positive effect on training. Fifty-two per cent said the effect would be neutral, 21 per cent said it would be damaging and 7 per cent did not reply. A minority of these private sector executives supported statutory moves to promote training within companies, such as the return of a levy on companies which do not train to a minimum level. This is proposed by Labour. Directors, whose ranks include a minority representation of trade union members and public sector executives, were satisfied with progress in a number of areas including relationships with schools in their areas. Most were ambitious to expand their 'enterprise' role and to take over all the small business initiatives of the Department of Trade and Industry. However, they were critical of their progress in promoting and improving training within companies.

The article gives a misleading impression of the purpose of the report, as well as its implications for Nigeria's prospects for debt relief. The report is part of an extensive policy dialogue between Nigeria and the bank. It was based on a review of federal government public expenditure carried out by the bank staff in collaboration with the main economic and sectoral ministries in Nigeria in the early part of 1991. The main thrust of the report was a number of recommendations on expenditure control and management, project selection criteria, and other measures to strengthen the budgetary process and improve the efficiency of public expenditures. It might be noted that president Babangida, in his 1992 budget address, specifically articulated concerns about the need for sound public expenditure management. We disagree with your article's speculation that the 'report may hit prospects for debt rescheduling'. On the contrary, we consider a candid review of public expenditure management to be a key step in Nigeria's implementation of its structural adjustment programme and its efforts to secure concessionary and longer term debt relief from creditors. The World Bank has consistently supported, and continues to support, the government's efforts to seek relief from its external debt burden, without which the economic recovery and growth of this most populous country in Africa would be difficult - a point which was made in your accompanying article on Nigeria entitled 'An urgent need for debt relief'.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / Champion of liberty and law: The work of the late Friedrich von Hayek 
text:  Many would say that if Mrs Margaret Thatcher is a conviction politician, the convictions are those of Friedrich von Hayek, who died on Monday at the age of 92. Yet the conclusion would be unfair to both. Although the former UK prime minister was a great admirer of the late economic philosopher, Hayek mainly provided articulation and confirmation of convictions Mrs Thatcher had already reached. The admiration was reciprocated, yet there was much in his writings that some would see to be at variance with Thatcherite practice. Friedrich August von Hayek was born in Vienna on May 8 1899. His father was a professor while the imperial city was enjoying its celebrated sunset. Brahms had only recently died, and Freud had yet to publish his major works. Hayek's own career began in the civil service, and after holding academic posts in Vienna he came to the Lon-don School of Economics in 1931. Recalling his arrival, Lionel Robbins subsequently wrote: 'I can still see the door of my room opening to admit the tall, powerful, reserved figure which announced itself quietly and firmly as 'Hayek' '. His lectures were so successful that the school's director, William Beveridge, suggested that he remain as Tooke Professor, a post he held until 1950. Hayek brought a whole host of cosmopolitan contacts to the LSE. He was, for instance, instrumental in the appointment of Sir Karl Popper, the philosopher and author of The Open Society. Although Hayek's later career took him first to Chicago and then back to Austria and Germany (his last years were spent in Freiburg in Breisgau), he retained his British nationality (acquired in 1938), and he remained a close observer of the British scene. He was a joint winner of the Nobel Prize for economics in 1974. He was twice married; he leaves a widow, Helene, and a son and daughter. Hayek's fortunes teach us a great deal about intellectual fashions. During the 1930s he was mainly known for technical economic studies, which were at the time overshadowed by the new Keynesian theories on unemployment and economic policy. One conclusion from that period, recently disinterred, is that market institutions could not just be grafted on to state socialism, as mainstream economists long believed was possible. Hayek's greatest intellectual regret for those years is that he never wrote a full-scale critique of Keynes's The General Theory. He had previously written a long review of the first volume of Keynes's earlier Treatise on Money - only to be told by Keynes that the latter had changed his views. This experience led Hayek to suppose that The General Theory was just another 'tract for the times'. In the 1940s Hayek became a hate figure to those on the political left because of his onslaught on centralised economic planning and his insistence on the links between political and economic freedom in his best-selling Road to Serfdom: the book is said to have influenced Winston Churchill's controversial 1945 election broadcast about the threat of a 'Gestapo' under socialism. It is less well known that Keynes sent Hayek a letter expressing his deeply felt agreement with at least some of the argument. Hayek was not a charismatic public figure. His brief post-war notoriety was followed by decades of neglect, during which his most important constructive works on the foundations of a free society were written. Indeed, I was first attracted to his writings by his concern, voiced in The Constitution of Liberty (1960), 'for that condition of man in which coercion of some by others is reduced as much as possible'. Finally, following his Nobel prize in 1974, he emerged as a cult figure of the radical right - which did neither side too much good. For there was far more to Hayek than the demolition of socialism and the standard case for free markets. In presenting him as a revered thinker with a complete system, his followers may have made his work neater, simpler and less interesting than it really was. Although Hayek was far too shrewd to overrate the Nobel award, for one reason or another the years following it witnessed a rejuvenation. Among political theorists and sociologists critical of the new right, he was studied more seriously than the more fashionable economic technicians. But he took this adulation with a large pinch of salt and was no more a Hayekian than Keynes was a Keynesian. Hayek was unfashionable in the 1950s and 60s as much for academic as for political reasons. At a time when most go-ahead economists were raring to equip themselves with forecasting models and computer print-outs, Hayek - in contrast to Milton Friedman - seemed an armchair thinker, preoccupied with ideas such as the limitations of human knowledge and the problems that economists would have if they tried to ape the natural scientist. But in the longer haul the contrast did not necessarily tell against Hayek. A disadvantage of recent methodological orthodoxy is that many economists have acquired a vested interest in the existence of stable, discoverable numerical relationships between phenomena such as income and consumption, or short-run changes in the money supply and the price level. Hayek warned that one could not guarantee the successful discovery of such relationships, but that scientific method could still be applied to predict certain general features of interacting systems - as it is, for instance, in biology and linguistics. His insistence that, while inflation is a monetary phenomenon, there is no such thing as 'the quantity of money', and no sharp boundary between money and other financial assets, has stood the test of time. The experience of the British government, which has changed its view of monetary targets so much and to so little avail, was much less puzzling to a Hayekian than to a true monetarist believer. So, too, was the high unemployment cost of reducing inflation, which Hayek insisted was inevitable while labour markets were dominated by the collective bargaining mentality. Hayek's defence of the market system was subtly different from that of many economists. Whereas mainstream economists have been preoccupied with the optimal allocation of resources in given conditions, Hayek was concerned with the effect of the market system on the evolution and stability of society. He was interested in markets as examples of human institutions, like language or law, which have evolved 'as a result of human action, but not of human intention'. He insisted that wants, techniques and resources are not given, but are constantly changing - in part because of the activities of entrepreneurs who open up possibilities which people did not know existed before. (The dynamic and entrepreneurial aspect was also emphasised by another economist of Austrian origin, Joseph Schumpeter, thus providing a so-called 'Austrian' critique of mainstream neo-classical economics, which overlaps with the objections of 'radical' political economists.) According to Hayek, a market system is a discovery technique. No computer can predict the emergence of new knowledge, original ideas, or innovations - and people's reactions to them. His scepticism about the use of econometric relationships was based on a wider epistemological view. For he insisted that the most important kind of knowledge was not of propositions or theories, but of practical skills and dispositions governed by rules which we may imperfectly discover afterwards, but not formulate in advance. For Hayek the cardinal sin of our times was something known by the ungainly label of 'constructivism'. This was akin to what Michael Oakeshott called 'rationalism', and is the error of believing that any order we find in society has been put there by a designing mind - and can be, accordingly, redesigned from scratch. Hayek was very far from believing the conventional bourgeois pieties. He never imagined that there was anything just in market rewards. These depended on an unpredictable mixture of effort, ability and luck. Quite apart from the adverse economic consequences, it was not desirable even to try to reward merit through public policy, which would involve some authority deciding how much pain and effort a task had cost and how much of a person's achievement was due to outside circumstances. But, characteristically, Hayek spoiled a splendid and heretical contribution by insisting that any public policy towards the distribution of income and property (beyond the provision of a very basic social-security minimum) involved political assessment of merit and was thus incompatible with a free society and the rule of law. However, Hayek did not in fact provide any easily recognisable criteria for identifying state interventions of the harmful type. The free-market arguments in The Road To Serfdom were based on the incompatibility of central planning with personal liberty. In subsequent years Hayek approached the issue indirectly. He argued, especially in The Constitution Of Liberty, that the main condition for a free society is what he called 'the rule of law'. By that he meant a presumption in favour of general rules and against discretionary power. He attempted to derive from this conception not only the fundamental political and legal basis, but also the economic policies, of a free society. Many writers of the most diverse political persuasion accepted that general rules were an important protection - perhaps the most important single protection - for freedom. But Hayek was criticised for suggesting that general laws were a sufficient condition for a free society. Many policies involving a high degree of coercion can be imposed by general rules - for example, a ban on the teaching of evolution or on any literature or music which flouts the principles of Marxist-Leninism. There is no one philosopher's stone for minimising coercion in society. Hayek's concern to restore a government of laws rather than men can be seen from his later writings which warned of the degeneration of democracy into a struggle for spoils among competing groups. He saw the source of interest-group domination in what he called 'majoritarian' or unlimited democracy. This is the belief that a government elected by a majority of voters (usually a plurality) should be able to enact what it likes without any check - a system which Lord Hailsham has termed an elective dictatorship. Some of Hayek's own constitutional proposals struck even his admirers as far-fetched. But their underlying aim was important. It was to recover an older idea of a state, which has no purposes of its own, but provides a framework of rules and arrangements under which people can pursue their own individual aims without getting in each other's way. This ideal - which is a long way removed from the practice of any modern government, even of the radical right - has been labelled by Oakeshott as a 'civil association', as opposed to the more usual idea of the state as an 'enterprise association' with its own aims and purposes. The close similarity of the later work of both Hayek and Oakeshott, pursued in relative isolation, is a theme which deserves a study of its own. There were great ultimate differences between Hayek and others who shared a similar outlook. Unlike most classical liberals, Hayek's espousal of liberty turned out to be based neither on ultimate judgments, nor on considerations of welfare, utility or happiness. He did not even accept the methodological individualism of most mainstream economists. For him, the key to institutions was natural selection among competing traditions. This evolutionary approach remained in the background in the classic politico-economic works of his middle period. But its roots went back to his student days when he was as concerned with philosophy and biology as with economics. The evolutionary outlook landed Hayek with problems. For it made it difficult to criticise any social order (eg Stalinist Russia) which was not visibly dying out. Hayek's refuge in evolution was not just idiosyncratic, but can be seen as a response to the failure of attempts to build deductive systems of morality which will apply to specific cases. His own inability to resolve the ultimate conundrums of human conduct should not obscure the range of his achievements. Hayek's writings have asserted the case for general rules over discretionary authority. They have exposed the misleading identification of a liberal democracy with the divine right of temporary majorities. They have demonstrated the connection between economic and personal freedoms. They have shown that the domination of both the political and economic market-place by interest group struggles is a source of evil; and they have explained why pecuniary rewards neither can nor should reflect merit. In all these matters Hayek - like Keynes or Friedman or the American philosopher John Rawls or other such seminal figures - is best treated as an intellectual agent provocateur rather than a pundit with all the answers.

text:  Are Britain's big banks and insurance companies examples of good corporate governance or class-ridden institutions run by gentlemen employing players? The question is prompted by the sight of the orderly succession at Lloyds, arguably Britain's most successful high street bank. In any other business, Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, might have been expected to be rewarded with the chairmanship given the sterling job he has done. However, Lloyds has never picked a chairman from its own management, and, as at the other clearers, it is only relatively recently that its managers have been given seats on the board. The cerebral Sir Jeremy Morse is handing over to Sir Robin Ibbs, an older ex-ICI man, with the clear implication that if Sir David Walker, the outgoing chairman of the SIB, does not blot his copybook, he will eventually get the job. Lloyds' behaviour is not unusual. Midland Bank tends to pick industrialists as its chairmen and NatWest specialises in country land-owners. The Bank of Scotland's Bruce Pattullo and Barclays' Sir John Quinton are rare examples of career bankers who have made it into the officers' mess. The big insurers are even more inbred. General Accident's chairman - the Earl of Airlie - doubles up as the Queen's Lord Chamberlain, Sun Alliance is headed by Henry Uvedale Antrobus Lambert, a scion of Barclays, Commercial Union's boss is a Baring and Charles Hambro heads GRE. The traditional arguments for employing such toffs is that their institutions need statesmanlike figures who know their way around Whitehall as well as the City. Creative tension is one thing but the danger of promoting a strong chief executive like Pitman is that he might second-guess his successor. Separating the role of chairman and chief executive seems de rigueur these days but the City's big financial institutions are hardly ideal role models. NatWest's Lord Alexander and the TSB's Sir Nicholas Goodison are typical bank chairmen, yet their institutions are struggling. The same is true of most of the big composites. Lloyds Bank is one of the few big City firms to have got the mix right. Given Sir Jeremy Morse's record, one must assume that he and his board have made the right choice now.

headline:  FT  25 MAR 92 / Dynastic hopes fall flat in France: The Agnellis' failure in the battle for Perrier reveals tactical errors in a changing business climate 
text:  Rarely since the early days of oil wild-catting has the ownership of holes in the ground excited as much high passion and low intrigue as during the tortuous four-month-old battle for France's Source Perrier, the world's largest mineral water company, which ended with an agreed settlement yesterday. Nor has any recent takeover struggle exposed more clearly the complex forces at work in a Europe where long-established continental models of capitalism, with their tribal loyalties and inter-locking networks of power, are forced to confront the rude imperatives of international markets. To the Agnellis, Italy's foremost business dynasty, whose efforts to win control of Perrier have been defeated by a coalition between Nestle, the Swiss food group, and powerful French backers, the message seems clear. Though they have made a handsome capital gain, it cannot compensate for their belief that they were victims of a French business establishment bent on showing that it controls entry into its backyard. There is some truth in that view. However, it is far from the whole truth. Indeed, one of the many paradoxes of the Perrier affair is that it seems more likely to promote than to retard the modernisation of national capital markets and the erosion of barriers designed solely to protect special interests. The affair is bound to be compared with the storm created by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's raid on the large Societe Generale de Belgique four years ago. That bid, too, was foiled after an anxious local business establishment turned for salvation to a foreign white knight, France's Suez group - which also happened to be a leading adversary of the Agnellis in the Perrier battle. However, there are important differences. One is that while Mr De Benedetti unleashed a shock assault on SGB from outside Belgium, the Agnellis had hoped to win Perrier by means of patient and friendly negotiation from the inside. That approach enabled them in the past five years to become France's largest foreign investors and cement close ties there. None more influential than with Lazard Freres, the investment bank and BSN, France's biggest food group, in which Lazard helped the Agnellis acquire a 5.8 per cent stake. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of the Fiat motor group, sits on Lazard's board, and his younger brother Umberto is a director of BSN, which the Agnellis have helped to expand in Italy. Meanwhile, Mr Michel David-Weill and Mr Antoine Riboud, chairmen respectively of Lazard and BSN, are directors of several Agnelli-controlled companies, in some of which BSN is a minority shareholder. With friends like these, how could the Agnellis go wrong? The answer lies in a succession of tactical errors, which led them to trample on traditional French sensitivities while also ignoring important changes in the business climate. Initially, the Agnellis moved stealthily, acquiring control of 34 per cent of Exor, the publicly quoted holding company which owns 35 per cent of Perrier, the Chateau Margaux vineyard and some Paris property. But after they launched a takeover bid for two-thirds of Exor in late November, things started to unravel. Partial bids are still legal in France: indeed, they were enshrined in stock market legislation only three years ago at the insistence of French industry, which argued that it could not otherwise match well-heeled international acquirers in takeovers. However, the mood has changed radically since, as evidenced by the French finance ministry's recent plans to make 100 per cent bids mandatory. An early clue was the protests by minority shareholders in the Au Printemps department store chain that they were disadvantaged by a partial bid by the Pinault conglomerate last year. The Agnellis stirred up a much more troublesome dissident in Suez, which objected that their FFr1,320 bid undervalued its 10 per cent stake in Exor. Though they hastily raised the bid to 100 per cent, that was not enough to mollify Suez. It approached Nestle, which began buying shares in Exor and Perrier. The Agnellis, meanwhile, compounded their error by alienating BSN and Lazard, which has long used its formidable network of government and business contacts to dominate the French merger scene. Mr Riboud was uneasy that the Exor bid would prompt the Agnellis to challenge BSN's position in mineral water. He grew still more alarmed when the Agnellis hinted that their longer-term target was BSN itself, where the 73-year-old Mr Riboud has no clear successor. That prompted Mr Riboud to co-operate closely with Nestle and Lazard to thwart the Agnellis' designs on Perrier. After efforts to persuade the Italians to surrender their claims on the mineral water company failed, Nestle and Suez launched a bid for it. Though Lazard had advised the Agnellis on earlier French investments, they did not involve it in their overtures to Exor, apparently believing that they were well-enough established not to need help. Spurned by the Agnellis and confronted with a threat to the interests of BSN, with which Lazard has intimate ties, the bank aligned itself with the Nestle-Suez camp. In spite of these setbacks, the Agnellis might still have hoped to soldier on. With French allies, notably the Saint Louis paper and sugar group and Worms, a family-run holding company, they controlled 48.8 per cent of Perrier shares and 49.5 per cent of the voting rights. However, three other factors were working against them. One was the high-powered public relations campaign mounted by the BSN/Lazard camp, which effectively branded the Agnellis as menacing interlopers and Nestle as the acceptable face of French capitalism. That was despite the fact that the management of Exor and Perrier regarded the Agnellis' approaches as friendly and the Nestle-Suez bid as hostile. Just as remarkably, the campaign succeeded in portraying Nestle, a company from a non-EC country not renowned for respecting minority investors, as a shining champion of disfranchised French shareholders. Furthermore, Nestle's explicit proposal to break up Perrier was magically transformed into a virtue, while the same intent was imputed to the Agnellis - on the basis of dubious evidence - and used to discredit their bona fides. The second element was the Agnellis' misplaced confidence in Mr Jacques Vincent, president of Exor and Perrier. Not only is Mr Vincent poorly regarded by France's business establishment, but his illicit transfer of 13.8 per cent of Perrier shares from the company's treasury to Saint Louis inadvertently led to his allies' nemesis. Challenged by Nestle, the transfer was annulled by a Paris commercial court last week, depriving the Agnellis of almost a third of their Perrier votes. That crucial defeat highlights the central importance of the third element - the role played by France's takeover rules, which were repeatedly put to the test during the battle. Dating only from 1989, the rules are still immature, while the organisations charged with implementing them - notably the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) and the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), have yet to achieve the standing acquired over many years by Britain's Takeover Panel. None the less, the regulations provided a framework of a kind completely absent in Belgium at the time of the SGB battle. Not only were they enforced throughout the Perrier battle; they were invoked energetically by Nestle's allies in the French business establishment, who strove to present themselves as the upholders of transparency and the rule of law, while stigmatising the Agnelli camp as exponents of dubious double-dealing. Intentionally or not, support from such influential market operators can only serve to entrench the legitimacy of regulatory reform. At the very least, the Perrier affair seems likely to become a benchmark against which the conduct of future takeover battles will be judged. That said, the French market for corporate control is still a long way from the standards of openness of the Anglo-Saxon world. Not only does state ownership envelop a wide swathe of the productive economy, but publicly-quoted companies remain better protected against takeover than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts. Extensive cross-shareholdings encourage corporate solidarity against external attack, while regulatory reform has yet to eliminate a number of poison pill devices. More than in any other European country, the system is bound together by the cultural affinities of a powerful technocratic elite. Straddling the commanding heights of the public and private sectors, its members still possess a formidable capacity to coalesce in support of the perceived national interest - above all, when 'strategic' industries are at stake. That the government did not seek to intervene directly to keep Perrier in French hands owes much to the fact that powerful members of the elite favoured its acquisition by Nestle. Significantly, when the Agnellis' opponents were casting around for white knights, they specifically excluded US soft drinks companies including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo on the grounds that they would not be considered 'legitimate' bidders in France. Equally, few knowledgeable observers in Paris doubt that if an external threat were posed to the independence of a blue-chip company with an influential chairman - such as BSN - strenuous efforts would be made to arrange a 'French solution'. How far they would succeed, however, is an open question. The efficacy of such defences is being gradually eroded by time and the logic of the government's own policies. It can no longer legally block takeovers by bidders from other EC countries, while its ability to influence state-owned companies will diminish, as their need for fresh capital forces privatisation. Perhaps the most important agent of change, however, is the government's declared ambition to transform Paris into a truly international capital market and a more important source of finance for French industry. That will depend heavily on attracting foreign investors, who are unlikely to participate enthusiastically if they suspect that protection of local vested interests remains a priority. These divergent impulses are bound to create tensions and unpredictability. The many peculiar features of the Perrier battle make it an imperfect test of current French attitudes. Perhaps the safest verdict is that France is a less open country than the Agnellis hoped when the affair began, but less closed than they believed when it ended.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERRIER'S SPARKLING SETTLEMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nestle and Suez to increase offer for Perrier from FFr1,475 to FFR1,700 per shar.

text:  Rough Magic is a youngish Irish company, attractive and evidently very close-knit. The play they have brought from the Dublin Theatre Festival to the Bush is by one of their artistic directors, Declan Hughes, and directed by the other, Lynne Parker, and two of the actors here are founder-members. It would be easy to believe that each of the other five roles was written with its performer specifically in mind. They all play to one another with the beady-eyed easiness of old friends, which forbids social show-offery but does not preclude moments of asperity - just what Digging for Fire requires. The play is two familiar plays at once: the Reunion of College Chums that goes sour with home truths (sourer as the night wears on and they get drunker), and the Deflating of Heroic Pretensions (an Irish favourite since Playboy of the Western World, though there are many European versions of it). The fluent naturalism of the writing and playing almost disguises the schematic character-list - the host couple, doctor and teacher, whose professional security has not extinguished old yearnings for something less trammelled; a brittle media pair, he in advertising and she a TV presenter; a vine-leaves-in-his-hair loose cannon, the statutory gay, and a fey but sensible young woman (Pom Boyd, greatly appealing) whose HIV-positivity is declared early but never explained. We should have heard more about that, for the revelations we did get were dull stuff - conventional adulteries, and the falsity of a claim to literary fame. Various characters became convincingly cross, disabused or bitter as circumstances dictated, even with some vehemence, but no real blood was spilt; they were all too tame and nice for that. Hughes's writing for the detached gay (Peter Hanly) and the snuffed-out Dionysus (Darragh Kelly) left them bloodless too, visually well-cast but denied any interesting griefs to test them. How Arthur Riordan's advertising-chap could be (as advertised) so successfully randy remained a mystery; but Gina Moxley captures her telly-type with prickly assurance, and Sean Kearns makes a decent, solid blunderer of the doctor-host. For his dispiritedly romantic wife Jane Brennan provides continual subtleties, wry and engagingly honest: this is an actress who could shoulder a whole TV series with aplomb. The glum unspoken message of this Irish play seems to be that there's nothing Irish left among the trendy middle-class in Dublin. Many a Londoner might know every one of these people and the reunion-hosts' highly visible books - mostly paperbacks - emphasise the cosmopolitan point: Kundera of course, both the latest Martin Amises (a bit excessive?), the complete Nathanael West, drugs-and-pathology studies, Christopher Hitchens - instead of Conor Cruise O'Brien - and a token, glossily-illustrated The Irish Village. In Dublin, the shock of painful recognition was probably sharper than anything we can feel. Bush Theatre Box Office: 081-743-3388

text:  What is killing us these days? As nations become more developed and people more sedentary and dependent on technology, they become more prone to the diseases of affluence. Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in the developed world. Heart attacks and sudden death often occur without warning in people with no previous history of heart trouble. According to the World Health Organisation, of the 11m deaths a year in the west, a third are due to heart disease and strokes. Business people may be at high risk without realising it. Indeed, many might appear to be deliberately courting heart disease. When you set your long-term business plan, is your main aim simply to avoid going bankrupt? Obviously not. As business leaders, you set many goals for the company and keep a constant watch on the profit margin. Your health demands a similar approach. The four factors over which you can have some control and which affect your chances of heart disease are smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and excess weight. Each will be discussed in future Health Checks The heart is a small muscular organ, about the size of your fist weighing between 10 and 16 ounces. While you are reading this column, at rest, it is pumping five litres of blood a minute (200m litres of blood in a 75-year lifetime) to all organs of your body, carrying with it, among other critical substances, oxygen, glucose and cholesterol. While you are running for an aircraft at Heathrow or are stressed at a board meeting, the heart responds by increasing the rate and pumping capacity up to 22 litres a minute. Attempts to duplicate this natural miracle by man-made means and artificial hearts have defied the best minds in medicine. To perform its daunting tasks, your heart needs attention now, before it starts telling you that things are going wrong. The coronary arteries - small calibre vessels that carry the heart's own blood supply - will not develop symptoms until they are 75 per cent blocked. But once the arteries are blocked and producing symptoms - such as angina - your options are already severely limited. Most businessmen depend on three myths to avoid taking action. The first is that to get the benefits of health and fitness, you need to become fanatical - jogging at lunchtime and so on. In fact, becoming obsessed with anything (including exercise) is unhealthy. Go for balance that lasts. The second great myth is that optimistic feeling that disease always happens to the other guy. We are all susceptible. Finally, there is a common complaint that taking care of yourself is pure drudgery: eating rabbit food, cutting out all alcohol, sweets, coffee and rice food. Contrary to popular myth, you can have your cake and eat it too. But you will need to have enough information to make intelligent decisions regarding your health. However, there are no magic wands, pills, special weekends, or vacations when you will be able to 'clean it all up'. Building up a health and fitness reserve will take time and energy, but is your best investment. The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

Speaking in Belfast at the launch of his party's manifesto, he welcomed Mr John Major's recent statement that there would be no coalition government. However, his comments did not rule out an informal arrangement between the UUP and the Tories. If there was a hung parliament, Mr Molyneaux said, the UUP would take into account what was said in the Queen's Speech by the new government on policy issues regarding Northern Ireland, the economy and the Maastricht Treaty. Mr Molyneaux attacked the Liberal Democrats' ambition of participating in a coalition government. 'It is unacceptable that a rump of a party could be dictating the future of the UK,' he said, adding that his party was not 'making any demands.' But he warned that 'whoever forms the government knows where we stand and will have to take care not to alienate us'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday ruled out taking part in any coalition government which relied on the support of Ulster Unionists. He said it would jeopardise progress the government had made towards peace in the province. Mr Jim Nicholson, UUP chairman, said his party wanted devolution for Ulster and 'would not countenance a devolved structure in Scotland only'. He added: 'We would be happy to be the guinea-pigs for new regional devolution arrangements - we, after all, have the most experience in this'. He said that the UUP - which had nine MPs in the last parliament - would support a Labour administration if its policies were acceptable. Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP security spokesman, said he may 'make public' a recent letter he had received from Mr Major. He said it showed a 'much more positive response' to Unionist demands for security in Ulster to be stepped up. The UUP manifesto calls for: Restoration of the rule of law through the destruction of higher echelons within terrorist organisations. A clearly defined union, with the Queen in parliament remaining supreme. Removal of the Irish Republic's claim to Northern Ireland and an end to the Anglo-Irish agreement.

text:  Many candidates are fondly recalling the days of Mrs Thatcher when elections were held in late spring or early summer. Today the cold is a factor. Andrew Pearce, the former Euro-MP trying to hold Ellesmere Port and Neston for the Tories, is struggling on in a dark blue suit without an overcoat to try to project the right image. One pensioner recoiled two feet, startled as he shook Pearce's frozen hand. 'It's like doctors examining patients. You shouldn't do it with cold hands in case you make them jump,' Pearce said. He is developing a technique of running between front doors to keep his circulation going, with his right hand thrust inside his trouser pocket to soften its impact on unsuspecting voters. Then there is the dark. Lynda Chalker recalls that she was once dragged inside a house by a man when canvassing alone in London in her youth. 'I used my knee and nails and fought my way out.' Now she has a man with her when canvassing at night. But many people will not open their front doors to anyone much after 8pm. Like most candidates, she is looking forward to summertime to begin at the weekend. Then, of course, the weather could change for the worse. There has not been much snow so far.

text:  The Conservatives will have to be more careful with their arithmetic. David Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, repeated again yesterday the charge that John Smith's shadow Budget would represent 'the largest ever increase in taxation' during peacetime. He was wrong. The Treasury's own figures show that the Pounds 6.8bn which would be raised in a full year by Mr Smith's plan to abolish the National Insurance ceiling and introduce a new 50p top rate of income tax is comfortably below the equivalent increase raised by Sir Geoffrey Howe in his 1981 Budget. Sir Geoffrey's decision to respond to the 1980-81 recession with a swingeing cut in public borrowing added Pounds 4.3bn (relative to an indexed tax base) to revenues. In today's prices that would amount to Pounds 7.9bn. The Conservatives might recall that Sir Geoffrey's package was judged subsequently to have been the turning point for the economic success of the 1980s.

There is also talk of his returning to Brussels as Britain's senior commissioner at the European Community. So what is Richard doing during the election? He says he is getting on with his legal work and has written to Jack Cunningham, who is organising the Labour campaign, offering his services. Nothing is yet fixed, but Richard is likely to be seen helping Alf Dubs to fight the marginal seat of Battersea. Richard was MP for nearby Barons Court from 1964 to 1974. Harold Wilson then made him Britain's permanent representative at the United Nations, after which he had what may turn out to be a first spell as commissioner in Brussels. Now aged 60, he is clearly open to offers, but talk of Brussels surprised him.

Not content to wait for the outcome of the general election, voters in the Somerset seaside resort of Minehead are expressing their political preferences daily through purchases at the local baker's. Steve Wells, proprietor of the Wheatsheaf Bakery in The Parade, is baking and selling buns with icing to match the colours of the political parties and recording purchasers' preferences through a bunometer in the shop window. The results of the political bun-fight are unequivocal. Of the 250 buns sold since baking started on Saturday, 51 per cent have been blue, 37 per cent yellow and 12 per cent red. Psephologists might note that the bun breakdown exactly reflects the running order in the constituency at the last general election. Minehead lies within defence secretary Tom King's safe Conservative seat of Bridgewater: the turnout for the blue buns is identical to the 51 per cent vote for King in 1987. The SDP Alliance polled 30 per cent that year, and Labour 18 per cent. Flavour cannot be a factor since, apart from the colour of the icing, all the buns are the same.

text:  If foreign policy determined the outcome of elections, the Conservatives would be assured of victory. You have merely to shut your eyes and think of Mr John Major and Mr Douglas Hurd working in tandem to protect our interests against the predatory and insane collection of foreigners that populates the globe. Comforting, is it not? No? Even if you cannot quite believe in Mr Major as, shall we say, Palmerston or Disraeli, Mr Hurd must appear on any list of first-rate foreign secretaries. It is at the very least reassuring. It should be a strong election sell. The Labour party cannot match it. This is not a comment on the diplomatic or personal qualities of Mr Neil Kinnock or Mr Gerald Kaufman. For all we know of their behaviour, should they reach office the former may be the Attlee and the latter the Bevin of the 1990s, although I suspect that he himself would doubt that. Unfortunately for Labour, neither looks the part. Neither has the necessary experience. On this issue, their images are subsumed by those of the prime minister and Mr Hurd. For the duration of the campaign, the government's control of foreign affairs must be counted a Conservative asset. The Tories have not always deserved such public confidence. Take just two post-1945 examples. Africa and Europe have frequently divided the party, to the detriment of the national interest. It is 30 years since Lord Salisbury called the then colonial secretary, Mr Iain Macleod, 'too clever by half' for his cunning constitutional ploys during the process of withdrawal from Britain's African colonies. The phrase nearly destroyed the career of a man who is often cited as a role model by Mr Major. In the 1960s the Conservative right, which took first the Kenya settlers' side and later that of the white South Africans, was bitterly critical of the Tory left's de-colonisers. It derided the then Mr Harold Macmillan, whose 'wind of change' speech filled the sails of the anti-apartheid movement. Between 1983 and 1991 the Tories were nearly destroyed by squabbles over Europe. Arguments about Britain's stance within the Community led to the resignations of Mr Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe. The long-running schism - 'real Corn Law stuff', as one senior minister put it at the time - eventually brought Mrs Margaret Thatcher down. This followed a challenge from Mr Michael Heseltine, whose celebrated departure from Mrs Thatcher's cabinet was precipitated by a European issue. Mrs Thatcher aimed to keep Britain in what she hoped would be a special relationship with the US. No harm in that. All her post-1945 predecessors, Labour and Conservative alike, had done the same. But her perception of the EC was distorted by suspicion of the motives of the Brussels administration. She did not trust the Germans, and had little time for the French. She was at heart an English nationalist. No doubt she still is. Initially, she was also wrong about South Africa. She opposed sanctions at a time when they were a necessary weapon against apartheid. She was lucky: her support won the trust of the Afrikaners. That enabled her to be useful in facilitating the end-game. But you could not honestly conclude that in the period 1979-90 the principal strands of foreign policy were safe in the Tory government's hands. Nor is it possible to be sure that the Tories will get Europe right if they stay in office. They still aspire to win the election, but on present form they can only hope to do so as either the largest party in a hung parliament or by a very slim overall majority. In that circumstance, the legislation following the Maastricht treaty - a new 'Europe Act' - might be difficult to get through the Commons. A small handful of Thatcherite Europhobes could easily destabilise the proceedings. The never-ending post-war argument, which first kept us out of the EC and then on the periphery of its affairs, would be resumed. Yesterday the Conservatives edged a little towards Mrs Thatcher's side of this argument, partly to disadvantage Labour and partly in anticipation of a renewed debate after April 9. 'Conservatives favour a free enterprise and outward-looking Europe,' said Mr Hurd. 'Labour . . . embraces the Community as a new source of regulation . . .' The Social Charter, which the Conservatives refused to accept, would 'destroy British jobs'. He questioned Labour's judgment on this and other issues, such as nuclear deterrence, EC membership, South Africa and the single market. It is fair political discourse, and it might do well in an election campaign in another age. The greatness or otherwise of Britain is ever a saloon-bar topic, although I suspect less so now than, say, in the aftermath of the Falklands or Gulf wars. The contest due to be settled on April 9 is, however, about domestic concerns, such as the recession, education, and health. Turn away from that map of Europe: it is through the sickbeds of England that Labour proposes to march to victory.

text:  Bartok's one-acter and Schoenberg's 'monodrama' are both couple dramas, even if in Erwartung one member of the couple is missing presumed dead. Both, too, gradually reveal a past in which other people - specifically, other women - were involved. Both look back to that past across a chasm of incomprehension: they are crisis pieces, both dating from the time of musical crisis around 1910. And both are operas in which the essential action is interior. They fit together well, if, as in the Canadian Opera Company's new production at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto, the longer Bartok piece comes before the exploded, shattered Schoenberg. They also, as a pair, provide an apt and stimulating occasion for the operatic directing debut of Robert Lepage. The Bluebeard's Castle is not so unusual. The spoken introduction is wisely cut; instead there is a great gilt frame around the stage picture to tell us that what we are seeing is a parable, and to enforce a visual connection with the companion piece. The first images within the frame are striking: a miniature gothic castle rotating in darkness and distance, and then - once Bluebeard and Judith have gone into the picture after delivering their first lines from in front of the frame - an oppressively gloomy, severely square-sectioned tunnel or corridor, coming towards us from a faintly lit portcullis entrance, with the seven doors along the left wall and unbroken masonry along the right (designed by Michael Levine). So far, so good. But the stage inventions for the openings of the doors are disappointingly tepid: a patch of flame-like light for the torture chamber; for the jewel house, a handful of pearls which, in a limp gesture, Judith scatters; a projection of planet earth for Bluebeard's domain; a lake of tears that Judith can coyly dabble her hand in. Only for the final opening does the production heat up, as Bluebeard's three former wives seem to rise up through the tear lake, though what drenches their wedding gowns is blood. Here too the orchestra, under Richard Bradshaw, begins to sound excited, especially in the climactic passage where Judith takes her place with her predecessors. Before this the sound is dim and disconnected, and devalued in the domains sequence by a weedy organ. Yet the vocal performances are excellent: Jane Gilbert is a noble Judith, determined and always richly voiced, and Victor Braun sustains a grey lyricism as a Bluebeard scarred and numbed by experience, never believing he can escape his fate. If this Bluebeard could almost have been staged by anyone, the Erwartung comes at us observed by a very special eye. Mr Lepage takes advantage of having three supernumeraries for Bluebeard's earlier wives to increase the dramatis personae of Schoenberg's solo opera. When the performance starts, in silence, the unnamed Woman of the score is cowering by the bare wall left over from Bluebeard, while a man in a white coat sits ready to take notes. One's heart sinks at the prospect of an 'explanation' of Erwartung as a psychoanalytic session: that was where the piece began, in the experiences of the librettist Marie Pappenheim as a medical student in turn-of-the-century Vienna, not where it ended, or should end. However, the realism is only there to be turned into the chilled, poised surrealism of Lepage's production, which demands, and gets, feats of gymnastic control from his extras. The next time we see the psychiatrist - the set repeatedly darkens to focus on the Woman allowing nimble scene-shifting - he is calmly sitting sideways on, as if the wall were a floor, while another man, later identified as the Woman's lover, dangles alarmingly through a hole in the wall from one heel. The mesmerising glide from image to image takes account of what specific elements there are in the libretto, such as the Woman's reinterpretation of her lover's corpse as a log in the forest through which she imagines herself searching. There are also echoes of the Bluebeard staging: Judith rolls rapidly down the stage away from her husband; the lover's naked body makes the same journey slowly, anxiously followed by the Woman who has just lashed at him with a scythe. But more generally the response is to the strangeness and fluidity of the music, to its intensity, its sharp, glistening focus. Even though Schoenberg's own designs for the piece suggest something dark and indistinct, this clinically accurate askewness, this language of dreams, is right on target. Contact between the stage and the score is further assured by Rebecca Blankenship's imposing performance as the Woman, and by the orchestral playing, which is so much more alert than in the Bartok, and which, in its delicacy touches the lunar beauty of Schoenberg's music. The double bill goes to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York this week, and to Edinburgh in the summer

text:  Early every year since 1990, the Tate has paraded itself, proud and elegant, in its new finery: which is not to suggest for one moment, pace the poor Emperor in the old story, that the exercise is become a charade and self-deceptive sham. The clothes are there all right, intriguing and fetching by turns. And if they should seem at times a trifle skimpy, and just a little more see-through than before, is that not but the very latest thing of modern fashion? The debate, of course, remains as hot and furious as ever, for one man's chic is another's frumpiness, or misjudgment, or active indecency. For my part I find a great deal to be said in favour of this year's rehang, as before. Nicholas Serota's great achievement as incoming director, as he was in 1990 when this rolling programme of rehanging began, was to reclaim and celebrate the Tate Gallery itself, as architecture at the service of art. We had simply forgotten how good a building the Tate really is at its fin-de-siecle heart, ample, generous and confident in its purposes. That first thrill of surprised recognition remains, undiminished. No matter that this time the sculpture halls contain Rodin at one end and the conceptual minimalism of Carl Andre and his friends, bricks and all, at the other. To move through from the bustle of the entrance lobby and out into that high, long, central nave is to experience and savour one of London's most particular architectural experiences. And while the feeling may not be sustained at quite such a pitch of magnificence, sustained it is in kind through the sequence of the older rooms, each one hung with exquisite consideration, quite as much for the room itself as for the work to be presented. Only with the drab functional walls of the 1970s extension does there come any sense of anti-climax, and even here it is hardly for want of effort on the part of the directorate. Every room is well presented within the terms it sets itself. Most rooms contain particular works, often unshown these many years, of remarkable interest and quality. Exception may be taken to the what of it, but surely not in any fairness to the way of its being shown. It is the irony of the situation that Mr Serota has now contrived for himself, that it is indeed quite as much the way as the what of it, for which, fairly or not, he stands generally rebuked. The nub is neatly put on his behalf, and with unconscious irony, by the sponsor, BP, in its introductory statement to the Brief Guide to these New Displays. 'From the outset, the purpose of our partnership with the Tate Gallery has been to enable many more people to see works of art which would otherwise remain in storage . . . the full range of both the national collection of British art from 1500 to the present day and of international 20th century art (has thus been) more fully exposed than ever before.' Up to a point, Lord Copper. The real issue is what the Tate is, or should be, or could be, and it has clearly been Mr Serota's intention from the outset to make no bones about the problems he faces. For the Tate as it is presently constituted is riven by stresses and contradictions of purpose and policy that are all but irreconcilable, and all to be addressed on evidently inadequate resources. That first rehang, in 1990, was quite as much a political as a curatorial statement, as though to say: here is a gallery into which we can only put so much, if we are to show things as they should be shown: and here is a collection with which we could do so much, if only . . . It is an argument with which I have a great deal of sympathy. The Tate has magnificent collections which are inadequately presented not by any professional dereliction or neglect, but simply because anything better is impossible. The wonder is that they are presented at all, let alone with the manifest care, imagination and commitment that are the character of this present 'inadequacy'. But how can the Tate hold at once the national collection of British art, that alone would more than fill the present site, and of the art of the modern period, into which the British contribution must be integrated, and of contemporary art, in all its forms, that must be monitored and collected on the wing? The point was well made, and made, and made, and is now made again - which is where sympathy begins, if not to fail, at least to moderate. For what was at the outset a fine and necessary demonstration begins now to seem indulgent. Whatever its strains and stresses, the Tate remains the repository of a collection and national resource that for three years now and at least one to come, has not been available to the public in any practical and permanent sense. What we have had instead has been an extended sequence of special exhibitions, beautifully chosen and arranged on all manner of themes, that is a wonderful bonus for the frequent and specialist visitor, but quite arbitrary for any newcomer. The historic British collection up to 1900 is now confined to the first nine rooms of 30. From room 10, the paintings spread ever fewer on the wall, to confound the argument that space is at a premium. Everywhere there are memorable and lovely things, a magnificent double portrait by Fantin-Latour in room 10, Cedric Morris's eggs in room 20. There were different delights last year and the year before, which I dearly wish were there still, and I shall regret it when this year's works, too, soon disappear. Last year I entered a plea, not for the reversal of the rehang policy, but rather for its moderation and gradual consolidation around a re-established core. No change there: and in again taking the general principle, I have had no space to treat the particular displays, splendid, controversial, infuriating as by turn they are. I hope to return at least to some of them in due course. The New Displays at the Tate Gallery are supported by British Petroleum

text:  The BBC Symphony Orchestra's current series of Royal Festival Hall concerts  -low-priced, informally presented, imaginatively planned, and (as ever) simultaneously broadcast on Radio 3 - seems to be catching on. Friday's programme, conducted by Mark Wigglesworth, placed music by Messiaen and the 53-year-old Dutch composer Louis Andriessen side by side. It was well attended and well received - as indeed it deserved to be: the mixture was uncommonly lively, stimulating, even perhaps a touch troubling. The revised version of Andriessen's De Snelheid ('Velocity') was given its premiere. This is a 'process' piece - the composer's own phrase from his introductory chat with Steve Martland - and an attempt to create complex effects of fast movement through contrasts and conflicts of pulse and metre. From the start a regular beat knocked out on woodblocks provides the musical foundation. Three differently disposed instrumental groups then proceed to build upon it in cross-cutting patterns, and the base-beat itself eventually increases in speed, so that a sense of larger momentum is produced out of proportion to the sum total of all the jiggling, bouncing - and loudly delivered - component parts. The experience will probably have given greatest pleasure to those who like brash, rock-related sounds bashed out without falter or finesse, and those who enjoy following the tidy working-out of a self-set conceptual problem. Andriessen admirers know what to expect, and if a non-admirer complains that other musical qualities seem non-existent in De Snelheid, he or she is probably missing the point. It made for a curious and fascinating contrast to follow this 20-minute stretch of 1990s high-tech musical brutalism with the 80 minutes, opulent colour resources, swooning melodic delights and picturesque mysticism of Messiaen's Turangalla symphony. Wigglesworth, who had led a sharp-cut account of the Andriessen, here revealed one or two chinks in his conductor's armour: for while the slow movements were unfolded with suitably rapt control of pace, the fast ones were persistently smudged and spotted by out-of-synch orchestral ensemble. Another set of contrasts was in store in the same hall two evenings later: Pierre Boulez, conducting the Parisian Ensemble InterContemporain in Messiaen's 1988 chamber-piece Un Vitrail et des oiseaux and then the Philharmonia in the 1937 orchestral version of the song-cycle Poemes pour Mi, brought to the music exactly the combination of spot-on rhythmic precision and pinpoint applications of colour lacking from Wigglesworth. Comparison is no doubt improper (for the one conductor is, after all, a senior musical figure of enormous experience and the other a hugely promising junior) but inevitable. The exhilaration of Poemes pour Mi was dangerously increased by the singing - scoreless, totally absorbed in word and musical phrase, totally transported - of that perpetually astonishing artist Maria Ewing. Hers is not the weight of voice Messiaen had in mind when writing it; a vast Isolde-like outpouring is needed to sweep across the batteries of brass. But by the sheer imaginative force, variousness and intensity of her delivery she contrived to re-invent both the music and her singing of it. This was altogether a rich concert: 'difficult modern music' of the kind now supposedly passe and unpopular yet offered with cracking zest to a Festival Hall full of youthful enthusiasts. Boulez also conducted the Ensemble in the first performance of his revised Derive 2, a coruscating scherzo-movement buzzing with the animation and flow of fast-moving conversation; and devoted the centre-part of the programme to Elliott Carter. Final fascinating contrast: between the knotty excitements and fiercely argued intellectual exuberance of Carter's Oboe Concerto and Three Occasions and the heady ecstasies of Messiaen - two composers born (in 1908) only 24 hours apart. This Ensemble InterContemporain-Philharmonia concert is being broadcast tonight on Radio 3.

text:  His jump could hang in the air and/or cover the stage. Able to seem both androgynous and animal, he was a vital symbol of the newness of the 20th century. A shy iconoclast, his liaison with Diaghilev was openly homosexual. His ballets, L'Apres-midi d'un faune, Jeux, and Le sacre du printemps were all ground-breaking works of early modernism, and presented aspects of sex that were new to the stage. Lady Ottoline Morrell told him (possibly her brightest remark) that when he danced he was not a man - he was an idea. Maybe no one who saw Nijinsky dance is left alive today, but the legend is as large as ever. All the above happened before he was 25, and before the First World War. So did his surprise marriage, which earned him instant dismissal from the ballet company that had brought him world fame, and permanent exile from Diaghilev's inner circle. The last part of his legend - madness - followed. In 1919, he was diagnosed as a schizophrenic, in which condition he remained until his death in 1950. Even the mad Nijinsky remains an idea. On the one hand, he identified with God; on the other, he was often both obscene and violent. Both sides connect to his creative career. Had his psychological abnormality been responsible for his creative originality? Or had he been Trilby to Diaghilev's Svengali? Death of a Faun, by David Pownall, is set in 1929, after Nijinsky has received news of Diaghilev's death. A one-man show for the ex-dancer Nicholas Johnson, it is conceived as a 90-minute mad scene. No violence or obscenities here - but bags of martyrdom. The real Nijinsky did on one occasion identify with the crucified Christ, but the God who he wants to be in his diaries is the Creator. And, when he spoke of dancing, he suggested that it was an exalting experience. But Johnson-Nijinsky, harping on the pain of dancing, identifies only with Christ on the cross. And, of course, he makes the connection to Petrushka (who is first seen hanging in a crucified position). The ex-dancer whom Johnson and Pownall put on stage is less like Nijinsky than like the more recent Gelsey Kirkland. Kirkland, another great dancer whose career ended early, then took to a much more vengeful and self-lacerating career - celebrity autobiography. But why bother to point out how wilfully this play misunderstands Nijinsky? It even mistakes the 'faun' of Nijinsky's ballet (a half-goat rural deity) for a 'fawn' (a young deer); and Johnson performs the steps with the kind of intense facial expression that Nijinsky took pains to delete from his choreography. The real Nijinsky was both more original and more pathetic than this trite diddums, and his legend will survive Death of a Faun. Nicholas Johnson, however, may be doing irreversible damage to his own career. Strain and pain are not what he himself communicated as a dancer. I remember his lyricism and sweet pleasure in dancing for an audience; and I am sad to find him defacing that image. It is better to recall the Mercutio he created in Rudolf Nureyev's 1977 Romeo and Juliet; and he dedicates these performances to Nureyev's memory. At the Orange Tree, Richmond

text:  Two years ago when former US Vice-President Dan Quayle described America's legal system as 'a self-inflicted competitive disadvantage' costing Dollars 300bn a year, US lawyers accused him of making cheap political capital at their expense. Mr Quayle's remarks struck a cord with the American people and business; in recent years they have grown used to ludicrous law suits and unjustifiable multi-million dollar damages awards. A Connecticut man who sued a ladder maker for Dollars 3m after he fell off and injured himself because the manufacturer failed to provide a general warning of the dangers of using ladders is a case in point. Americans are undoubtedly litigious by European standards - 18.4m lawsuits were filed last year. But it is the size of awards, particularly awards of punitive damages for corporate misconduct, which is now causing concern in the US. Businesses claim the US civil liability system has itself become a liability to the economy. Excessive awards discourage innovation and curb competitiveness. Consumer groups say that the threat of lawsuits and awards of damages forces companies to make safer products. The clearest indication that the problem may now be getting out of hand came last week when General Motors was ordered by an Atlanta jury to pay punitive damages of Dollars 101m on top of compensatory damages of Dollars 4.2m to the parents of a 17 year-old boy who died in 1989 when his GMC pick-up truck crashed and burst into flames. Damages are high in America largely because they are still set by juries. Elsewhere, judges determine damages. US juries seem to side with the little guy suing the corporation, and, in setting awards, appear to be more influenced by what they feel the corporation can afford to pay than what would be fair compensation for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. Large punitive damages are a recent phenomenon in the US. In 1930 awards of Dollars 50,000, Dollars 33,333 and Dollars 12,650 were described by a law magazine as 'startlingly large'. By 1955, the largest punitive damages award in California was still only Dollars 75,000. In 1991 and 1992 alone, however, US courts upheld at least 15 punitive damages awards in the range of Dollars 5m-Dollars 60m. Recent attempts by businesses to curb levels of punitive damages through the courts have come to nothing. The US Supreme Court has considered four constitutional challenges to punitive damages in the past five years but has yet to uphold a single one. Now, however, it has accepted for review a case from the West Virginia Supreme Court involving a punitive damages award of Dollars 10m which may prompt the Supreme Court 'to decide, at long last, that punitive damages in the US have gone too far' say Mr Leo Herzel and Mr Roy Englert, partners of Chicago-based international law firm Mayer Brown &amp; Platt. If they are right and the Supreme Court succeeds in setting constitutional limits for punitive damages, lawyers say it will be one of the Court's most important decisions affecting business for a decade. The West Virginia case involved a dispute between two businesses, TXO Production Corp, a subsidiary of US steel oil and gas giant USX Corp, and Alliance Resources Corp, over rights to oil and gas beneath a tract of land in the state. A jury decided that TXO's lawsuit claiming doubt about Alliance's title to the land was frivolous and awarded Alliance Dollars 19,000 in compensatory damages, equivalent to its costs of defending the action. The jury, however, tagged on a punitive damages award of Dollars 10m which was upheld by West Virginia's Supreme Court primarily on the ground that TXO had been 'really mean'. Punitive damages awards in the US are often based on the belief that large companies should be made to pay more than small companies partly because many courts feel this is the only way to impress on senior management the need for responsible corporate behaviour, say Mr Herzel and Mr Englert. In the General Motors case, for example, it appears that the jury's decision to award such a huge sum was because it felt this was the only way to force the car maker to recall nearly 5m of the same 'sidesaddle' trucks which prompted the original court action. Critics say the 'sidesaddle' trucks are unsafe because the petrol tank, which is fitted outside the frame of the truck, explodes on side impact. General Motors, which made the 'sidesaddle' trucks between 1973 and 1987, has always maintained they are safe. Some US courts take a different view, however. Judge Easterbrook of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, for example, believes that ultimately it is the stockholders, the most important of whom are institutions representing ordinary people, who will bear the burden of any punitive damages award against a company. It is wrong, he says, to view punitive damages as a means of punishing big companies. In the TXO case the Supreme Court will have to decide whether West Virginia's system, by relying heavily on the defendant's wealth in assessing damages, violates due process under the US constitution. More important, particularly in the light of the General Motors case, the Supreme Court will also have to decide whether an award of Dollars 10m for a wrong valued at Dollars 19,000, has crossed the line of 'constitutional impropriety'. The last time the Supreme Court looked at the issue, in a case from Alabama, it said a punitive damages award equal to four times the compensatory damages awarded was 'close to the line'. The Supreme Court ruling in the TXO case is expected in June. In any event, the political climate may be beginning to turn against large punitive damages awards. In Virginia, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld the state's Dollars 350,000 cap on punitive damages. Other states have also introduced caps for non-economic loss and some require a proportion of the punitive damages to be paid to the state government rather than the plaintiff. For European companies with business interests in the US, the American damages system is both puzzling and worrying. In Europe, there is strong resistance within the courts to the type of punitive damages awards seen in America in recent years. Last June, the German Federal Supreme Court underlined this by ruling that American punitive damage judgments are not enforceable in Germany because they are contrary to public policy. In England, the Court of Appeal made it clear in the recent Camelford water pollution case that punitive damages will only be awarded in English law in very restricted circumstances. Mr David Higgins, a partner in City solicitors Herbert Smith who acted for the defendants in the Camelford case, says: 'The judgment makes it clear that the American example will not be followed here.' Until the punitive damages issue has been resolved in the US, Mr Herzel and Mr Englert's advice to large companies doing business in America is simple: guard against the risk of excessive damages by opting for settlement of disputes by arbitration or alternative dispute resolution wherever possible.

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Restrictive TV policy approved - European Court 
text:  The European Court last week provided reassurance for member countries worried about judicial intervention in the European Community's internal broadcasting market. The Court said national legislation limiting licensed broadcasting stations' rights to invest in, or be involved in, the establishment, or operation of, foreign stations were permitted under the Rome Treaty's ban on restrictions on the free movement of capital and freedom to provide cross-border services. The Court's ruling was given in response to a reference from the Dutch Council of State, arising out of proceedings brought by the Dutch media authority against Veronica, a licensed Dutch television station which operated on a non-profit-making basis. The Dutch court found that Veronica had infringed certain provisions of the 1987 Dutch media law. However, it asked the ECJ to interpret the Rome Treaty's rules relating to capital movements and services so that the national court could decide on the compatibility of the media law with those provisions. Under the Dutch media law, air time is allocated by the Dutch media authority to broadcasting stations which must be associations of listeners and viewers established for the purpose of representing a particular social, cultural, religious or spiritual interest referred to in their constitutions. Their exclusive, or at least primary, purpose must be broadcasting and the satisfaction thereby of the Dutch public's social, cultural, religious or spiritual needs. Income must be used by the stations in connection with programme broadcasting. A large part of their finances comes from subsidies allocated by the media authority. Other income comes from listeners' and viewers' fees and advertising revenue. The provisions of the media law challenged by Veronica prohibited the broadcasting stations established in Holland from carrying on any activities other than those authorised by the media law or approved by the media authority. The authority accused Veronica of infringing the regulations by participating in the establishment in Luxembourg of a commercial broadcasting station planned to transmit into Holland and by providing effective support. The media authority relied on three grounds: Veronica's management had prepared a business plan and provided legal advice; Veronica had provided a bank guarantee in respect of the current account of RTL-Veronica; and it had agreed with another company to provide it with finance for the establishment of a new company which would take a minority stake in RTL-Veronica. The ECJ held that, in the circumstances of the case, the treaty rules concerning capital transfers and services did not preclude national media regulation which prohibits a broadcasting station established in its territory from carrying on the sort of activities Veronica was accused of. The Court appears to have reached its conclusions for two different reasons. First, referring to recent case law concerning Dutch broadcasting regulation, the ECJ said that Community law recognised as legitimate, objectives such as those pursued by the pluralist and non-commercial media and cultural policy implemented in the Dutch media law. Such cultural policy objectives were in the general good and could be legitimately pursued. Then the Court changed direction. It referred to earlier case law establishing that national rules may be enforced to prevent abusive reliance on treaty rights relating to services for the purpose of circumventing the national laws that apply to those established in that member state. For that reason, the court held that the Dutch media law could be enforced to prevent broadcasting stations from circumventing the national rules. While the ECJ seems to have extended the legal principles applicable to the free movement of goods and services to capital transfers, it is not clear to what extent the court is saying that the questions raised in this case are purely internal to the member state concerned and, therefore, that Community law rights are not relevant. Case C-148/91, Vereniging Veronica Omroep Organisatie v Commissariat voor de Media, ECJ FC, February 3 1993. BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Dollars 5bn award against serial killer 
text:  In spite of increasing disquiet in the US about the rise in the scale of punitive awards in recent years, the general level of damages rose significantly last year compared with 1991, according to the US National Law Journal, writes Robert Rice. There were eight awards of more than Dollars 100m. One was for Dollars 5bn against serial killer Robert Berdella, part of which the insurers of his home may have to pick up; another was for Dollars 3.5bn, later reduced to Dollars 1.75bn, against Charles Keating in the litigation arising out of the collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan. In 1991 there were two verdicts of more than Dollars 100m. One was later set aside, the other reduced on appeal. The NLJ notes, however, that there were also far more settlements in 1992, both before and after trial. Many of the largest verdicts were settled within weeks of being handed down by juries. But awards in business disputes rose significantly and jury decisions continued to batter insurance companies. Accountancy firms were hit by two big verdicts: one for Dollars 338m against Price Waterhouse which was later set aside, and one of Dollars 558m involving Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the litigation arising out of the collapse of the computer disk-drive manufacturer Miniscribe. This was subsequently settled for an undisclosed sum. Some of the largest awards from previous years were also overturned or reduced in 1992. The largest verdict of 1990, Dollars 185m against Dresser Industries and Baker Hughes over the production of faulty oil-well fracturing materials, was overturned, while the biggest award of 1991, Dollars 127.7m against pharmaceutical giant Upjohn in a product liability case, was reduced to Dollars 38m. Overall, 17 large awards were settled after the verdict; 11 large verdicts were overturned or substantially reduced; and 11 prominent case were settled before trial for amounts of between Dollars 25m and Dollars 500m.

text:  Julian Avery, a solicitor with 20 years' experience in banking, has switched from one Lloyds to another in his latest career move, becoming the latest of a growing number of prominent business figures to throw in their lot with the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Avery, now 47, has been appointed executive chairman of Wellington Members' Agency, where he will lead efforts to upgrade the services the agency offers to the 600 Names whose affairs it handles. Head of European mergers and acquisitions at Lloyds merchant bank from 1990 until last year, Avery has also had a close involvement with private banking, especially in Paris where he headed Lloyds' subsidiary between 1986 and 1990. That should be an ideal blend of experience for a job in which he will need to persuade the wealthy that the time is right to join Lloyd's, as well as helping out with efforts to attract corporate capital to the Lloyd's market. Avery, like Wellington chairman Anthony Haynes who recruited him, is optimistic about prospects and has himself recently become a Name at Lloyd's. 'It is entirely appropriate for anyone who expresses confidence in the market to become a Name,' says Avery. But even if things don't go too well Avery has other experience that could come in handy. In the early 1980s he held senior management positions at Lloyds in Rio de Janeiro where he was closely involved in the Brazilian debt crisis. ***** Julian Mounter, former director general and chief executive of Television New Zealand, is to become president and chief executive of the Hong Kong-based Star TV. Star beams five channels, including the BBC's World Service Television, to 38 countries; two years after its launch, it is available in 11.5m homes. Cornish-born Mounter, 47, was a journalist on The Times for seven years and has worked for London Weekend Television and the BBC. At Television New Zealand, the old New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, Mounter pursued 'a policy of modernisation designed to succeed in a deregulated market' and was involved in everything from telecommunications to pay tv and video distribution. But last year he decided 'after 30 years of work' to take a year off and sail with his family. 'We crossed the Atlantic twice and spent time in the Caribbean,' he says. Mounter says he intends to pursue a policy of 'prudent expansion' at Star, which is owned by Hutchvision, a 50-50 joint venture between Hutchison Whampoa and a company controlled by Li Ka-shing and his family. As well as being president of Star TV, Mounter will also be chief executive of Media Assets, an independent company set up to explore programming opportunities in Asian markets. ***** The exit at the weekend of John O'Neill as executive chairman of Silvermines, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, follows the completion of the disposal of all the group's engineering activities, as part of a restructuring which leaves the group with three electrical companies in the UK and three investment properties in Ireland. O'Neill resigned 'at his request' after almost five years in the post, and is being replaced with a non-executive chairman Bob Morton, who joined the board just three months ago. Morton is a chartered accountant and is chairman of the Vistec group which supplies computer systems, software and services. He has also been chairman of the Burgess Group, Norank Systems and Hatfield Estates. He has a 6 per cent holding in Silvermines. Other board changes include the appointment of Pat Dineen as vice-chairman, and the co-option of George Russell as a non-executive director.

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Technology: Fundraising for a breakthrough - Technically Speaking 
text:  THIS IS a tale of two companies; both attempting to develop breakthrough technology, both deemed the leaders in their fields. One is American, the other Scottish. One is attempting to break world records for computer performance, the other to deliver on the promise of monoclonal antibodies to cure deadly diseases. Both have struggled to raise capital to continue their work. Supercomputer Systems (SSI) of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, is desperate for new backers. Two weeks ago the company closed its doors and laid off its employees when funds ran out. Founded five years ago by Steve Chen, a reclusive but renowned master of supercomputer design previously at Cray Research, SSI set out to build the world's most powerful supercomputer. Chen's venture won the backing of IBM, which is said to have invested more than Dollars 100m in the venture since 1987. However, beset by its own financial problems and impatient as SSI overran its development schedule, IBM pulled the plug at the end of January. Finding alternative funding has so far proved impossible. But SSI's employees have not given up. They continue to seek backing and claim that by November the company will be able to ship its first product. They say they have fulfilled SSI's founding dream by creating a prototype supercomputer which combines vector and parallel processing - the classic and modern approaches to supercomputing. They believe SSI could still become the supercomputer market leader by offering a unique combination of technology, fulfilling the requirements of general-purpose users as well as research scientists. Half a world away, Scotgen, of Aberdeen, Scotland, a leader in techniques to 'humanise' mouse antibodies so they are accepted by the human body and can attack viruses, has also found it hard to raise capital. However, Scotgen's prospects were significantly brightened by a Dollars 7m injection of US venture capital, as a result of last week's merger with Vasocor, a California biotechnology company. The merged company aims to develop diagnostic tests and treatments for heart disease, infectious diseases and cancer. Research will be conducted in Scotland, while the journey from trials to regulatory approval will be handled from California. These stories provide several lessons. Scotgen's experience confirms the concerns of many in the UK that a dearth of venture capital is inhibiting the formation of new businesses. However, as SSI's plight demonstrates, the belief widespread among would-be British entrepreneurs that US streets are paved with venture capital gold is sadly mistaken. Scotgen's deal was masterminded by Englishman Robert Fildes, a pioneer of the biotechnology industry and former president and chief executive of Cetus. He has raised more than Dollars 500m in funding for biotech companies in the past and has been the architect of several corporate alliances. A proven management record and experience in raising funds is critical to the prospects of a development-stage venture. In contrast, Chen's experience in designing world-acclaimed supercomputers has not equipped him to address the critical funding crisis that his company now faces. Scotgen's story might suggest that national pride should not be allowed to inhibit companies from seeking funding abroad. Ironically, SSI may not be free to seek a foreign backer, though it has tried. Foreign investment in US-based high-tech companies, especially those whose technology might be of military value, has has long been seen by many in Congress as 'selling the crown jewels'. Early evidence suggests this will be the approach of the Clinton administration, too. While the US may provide a more plentiful capital market for high-tech ventures, the UK might offer a more benign political environment. In other words, the grass is not that much greener on the other side of the pond.

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Technology: When all the chips are down - Sematech's tiny microchip highlights the resurgence of the US semiconductor industry 
text:  It is an achievement that some experts have likened to putting a man on the moon. Using only US-built production tools, Sematech, the government-backed consortium set up to re-establish US pre-eminence in semiconductors, has produced microchips containing electronic elements just 0.35 microns wide - about half the size of the most advanced chips currently in production. Sematech's breakthrough may be more symbolic than practical. It is expected to be several years before 0.35 micron technology is used in full-scale manufacturing. None the less, the achievement highlights the remarkable resurgence of the US semiconductor industry after several years of having to bow to Japanese competition. US companies last year won a larger share of the world chip market than Japan for the first time since 1985. Intel has become the largest chip maker in the world, and Applied Materials, a neighbour in Silicon Valley, has overtaken Tokyo Electron of Japan to become the world's biggest supplier of semiconductor production equipment. By making prototype 0.35 micron chips, Sematech set out to demonstrate that US chip production technology was now at least on a par with the best in Japan. 'In the semiconductor world, this is equivalent to a moon landing,' says Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, a California market research and consulting group. This is a far cry from the scepticism shown when Sematech was formed five years ago. Then, the US semiconductor industry was on its knees, outsmarted and outsold by Japanese competitors. The US share of the world chip market was falling rapidly. Japanese chips were widely held to be of higher quality than those made in the US, and Japanese companies dominated the world market for semiconductor production equipment and materials. Yet questions remain about how much credit Sematech should be given for the revival of the US chip industry and its equipment suppliers. Other factors include: the US-Japan semiconductor industry trade pact, which forced Japan to buy more foreign-made chips; the Japanese economic decline; the rise of Korean chip makers, who compete mainly with Japanese manufacturers of memory chips; and the strength of the world personal computer market, which has boosted sales of microprocessor chips, made primarily by US companies. Has the US semiconductor industry's comeback, therefore, really been a triumph of government intervention, or is it a demonstration of private-sector ingenuity and the forces of a free market? The question is pertinent as the new administration prepares to implement what is expected to be a more interventionist approach. 'Sematech is the enabler of the US semiconductor manufacturing resurgence,' says Jim Norling, president and general manager of Motorola's semiconductor business. 'It would not be an understatement to say that Sematech saved the (semiconductor production equipment) industry,' adds Papken Der Torossian, chairman of the Silicon Valley Group, an equipment manufacturer that has been one of the largest beneficiaries of Sematech research and development funding. Others take a more measured view, saying that Sematech served as a catalyst to get the industry to work together on common problems. Jim Bagley, president of Applied Materials, says: 'The next generation of wafer fabrication plants is expected to cost Dollars 800m (Pounds 530m) to Dollars 1bn per factory. The chip makers are saying that they cannot afford it and that equipment costs must come down, but the US equipment industry is barely breaking even. It is a Dollars 5.5bn industry that has zero profitability.' The solution, he and others believe, is greater co-operation between chip makers and equipment suppliers - as in Japan and elsewhere. Until regulations were loosened to allow Sematech members to work together on pre-competitive research, it did not happen in the US. Critics suggest that Sematech's Dollars 200m annual budget - half from member companies and half from the Pentagon - went to pay for some expensive, if important, meetings. The consortium has also, however, funded research and development that has significantly strengthened some US semiconductor production equipment companies. This has reduced US chip makers' dependency on foreign equipment producers, a critical goal of the Defence Department. Also, VLSI Research says US equipment suppliers have stemmed the erosion of their home market by foreign competitors and are beginning to gain ground in Japan and Europe. Not everyone in the US semiconductor industry is happy with Sematech's achievements, however. Some object to government funding of industry research. Others, including two of Sematech's original 14 member companies, feel the consortium has focused on the wrong issues. LSI Logic, a Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer, dropped out of the consortium last year saying it had lost sight of its original goal of improving chip manufacturing methods. The Defence Advanced Research Project Agency, which has provided half of Sematech's funds, last year said it intended to cut annual funding from Dollars 100m to Dollars 80m. The Pentagon agency views the consortium as a 'tremendous success, resulting in broad infrastructural changes within the industry', according to a report published by the General Accounting Office last year. Darpa explained its proposed reduction in funding by saying the industry 'should bear the primary responsibility for ensuring continued support for Sematech because it is an industry-led consortium addressing industry needs'. Its original justification for funding Sematech was to ensure that the US would lead in the development of advanced weaponry based on semiconductor chips. In contrast, industry members of Sematech had a different, although complementary, objective - to revive their industry. With a Republican administration opposed to any form of 'industrial policy', the semiconductor industry executives who founded Sematech saw the Pentagon's concerns about dependency on foreign technology suppliers as an opportunity to gain government support. With the election of President Clinton, US chip makers can afford to be more frank. They have drawn up a 'road map' of the long-term strategy to maintain competitiveness. Based on the assumption of no increased government or private-sector funding for research and development, it is aimed at enabling industry and government to work together by assigning the most effective roles to individual semiconductor companies, Sematech, university research and government-funded national laboratories, in a co-ordinated effort. WJ Sanders III, chairman and chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, a Sematech member company, says: 'I don't favour a lot of government involvement. I think the only reason Sematech made sense was that our external trading partners were pummelling us by using their government's capital.' While Darpa's money was critical to the formation of Sematech when the US semiconductor industry was in dire straits, the government agency was 'genteel' in its control over Sematech, observes Bagley, and its financial contribution relatively small. 'A hundred million dollars a year pales into insignificance in the context of US government spending . . . half the money and most of the resources for Sematech have come from industry.' If Sematech is to be the 'role model for government-industry co-operation', as Clinton said during his campaign, this points to modest government support for industry-led efforts rather than large-scale government programmes to restore industrial competitiveness.  ---------------------------------------------                           1991        1992 Company*               revenue      market                                  share (%)  --------------------------------------------- Intel (3)                5,064         7.7 NEC (1)                  4,976         7.6 Toshiba (2)              4,765         7.3 Motorola (4)             4,635         7.1 Hitachi (5)              3,902         6.0 Texas Instruments (6)    3,052         4.7 Fujitsu (7)              2,583         3.9 Mitsubishi (8)           2,307         3.5 Philips (10)             2,108         3.2 Matsushita (9)           1,929         2.9 Others                  30,266        46.1  --------------------------------------------- Total                   65,587       100.0  --------------------------------------------- *1991 ranking in brackets  --------------------------------------------- Source: Dataquest  ---------------------------------------------

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Escaping from the Euro-VAT maze 
text:  A CHANGE in the VAT rules brought about by the creation of the single European market has led to an anxious time for at least one British company. Northern Tooling Reclamation, a Wetherby-based company which reconditions industrial power tools, went through a difficult few weeks when it feared it might lose a large chunk of its continental European business. New EC rules which required it to start charging VAT on European deliveries led to threats from several of its agents that they would no longer be able to act for the British company. To make matters worse, confirmation of the rule change did not come through until early December, just three weeks before they took effect. Northern Tooling, with sales of just over Pounds 1m - half of them exports - and a workforce of 60, has found a way of absorbing the impact of the new tax rules. But only by paying Pounds 20,000 into a special bank account from which it will make VAT transfers to UK Customs. This avoids charging VAT to its European customers but means it ties up a large sum of its own money and takes on an extra administrative burden. 'If we had not had the cash to provide the VAT cash pool and remove the need for our agents to carry the VAT cost we would have lost their orders,' says Kenneth Sutcliffe, chairman of the 17-year-old company. The problem arose when Northern Tooling's activities were classified as 'repair', and subject to VAT, rather than 'process', which is not. Previously no VAT was payable on EC exports so the distinction did not matter. The company told its continental agents that it would add 17.5 per cent VAT to all its invoices from January 1. But when Northern Tooling's agents made their own inquiries, some said they were told by their local VAT authorities that they had no knowledge of the change. Sutcliffe checked again with UK Customs, who confirmed the new regulation, but was told there should be no problem because the agents would be able to reclaim the VAT. But since the agents had other suppliers who did not require them to get involved in VAT red tape, they felt they could live without Northern Tooling. Setting up the special bank account provides a short-term solution but it ties up Pounds 20,000 worth of badly needed capital. Northern Tooling will be able to reclaim the VAT from UK customs but there is a time delay between the initial payment and the repayment. It will also result in Northern Tooling paying over VAT to Customs only to claim it back almost immediately. Administering the bank account has meant that Northern Tooling has had to obtain power of attorney from its agents to claim the VAT refund. It has also had to come to an agreement with UK Customs for it to accept photocopies of its invoices rather than the originals. Customs has said it will look at ways to speed up the clearing of Northern Tooling's VAT refunds so that the impact on the company's cash flow is minimised. It will also lobby in Brussels for a change in the rules so that 'repair of goods' can be zero-rated. Like many other UK businessmen faced with single market changes Sutcliffe feels he is the victim of overzealous interpretation of the rules by UK Customs. But claims that the VAT authorities in other countries are more lax are hard to verify and Customs says it has to assume its counterparts on the continent are applying the rules. Nevertheless, this episode has been a nasty shock for Sutcliffe and exposed the vulnerability of his business to decisions taken by bureaucrats in Brussels and London. 'Had any of our major agents pulled out this would have placed a serious strain on our business,' he says. 'In normal circumstances we might have taken this in our stride but we are at the bottom of a recession. Who benefits?'

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Time for taxing the chancellor - In the run-up to the Budget, Charles Batchelor offers a guide for small business lobbyists 
text:  After decades of neglect small businesses are now rarely out of the headlines. Are the banks being beastly? Have Whitehall and Brussels tied them up in red tape? The climate in which small firms operate is subject to constant scrutiny. But important though these issues are, of even greater significance is the tax regime in which business operates. The run-up to the Budget gives small business lobbyists their best opportunity to influence the man who really matters, the chancellor of the exchequer. The small business groups have been joined in recent years by the more broadly-based business organisations such as the Institute of Directors, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry. All make reference in their budget submissions to the specific problems of small firms. This has been matched by the chancellor's growing willingness to address their particular concerns. The small business community is a large one with basic Tory sympathies. Last year saw changes in the VAT rules, a relaxation of inheritance tax and an easing of the burden of the Uniform Business Rate. In the view of the lobbyists, however, much remains to be done and this year's budget submissions contain a wealth of detailed proposals. The main areas of concern are: VAT. There is widespread concern that frequent adjustments to VAT are turning it into a tax on business instead of, as intended, a tax on final consumption. The IOD warns against it becoming a 'cascade' tax, which 'sticks' and gets built into the costs of businesses further down the chain. The Federation of Small Businesses calls for the elimination of VAT on transactions between VAT-registered businesses by zero rating them. Zero-rating is already applied to cross-border trade within the EC. This would cut administration costs, minimise the problem of bad debts and reduce the risk of incurring penalties without affecting the VAT yield to the Treasury, it says. Raising the VAT threshold to Pounds 50,000 (from the present level of Pounds 36,600) would remove a heavy compliance burden at little cost, the IOD suggests. Capital gains tax. There is widespread agreement among business organisations that by setting this tax at 40 per cent - the same level as the top rate of income tax - the government has put an effective brake on enterprise. Equalising the two taxes took no account of the greater risks associated with building a business, the CBI says. It suggests that assets held for seven years should be exempt. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce limits itself to a call for a review of the tax threshold and suggests treating short-term gains as income. The IOD goes much further, arguing for a drastic cut in or abolition of capital taxes because of their adverse impact on the venture capital industry. The British Venture Capital Association makes its own detailed submission, arguing that the people who build up businesses should enjoy the same tax breaks as entrepreneurs and managers in other countries. In Britain's main competitors these people pay no capital taxes or are taxed at far lower rates. As an interim measure, the association suggests that working directors or managers should qualify for rollover relief on the proceeds of the sale of their shareholdings provided they reinvest the money in an unquoted company within three years. This would enable successful entrepreneurs to start up a second or third business becoming, in the association's graphic phrase, 'serial entrepreneurs'. Alongside rollover relief, the BVCA suggests a further extension of retirement relief, available to people who sell their businesses after the age of 55. It calls for the abolition of the age limit and the raising of eligible gain from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1m. Uniform Business Rate. A reduction in the UBR would be the most effective way of helping businesses survive the recession, according to the IOD and the Forum of Private Business. Business rates form a large part of the total costs of many businesses and cuts would have an immediate impact on cash flow. A replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme. For all its faults the BES met a need and its demise at the end of 1993 will leave a gap in the availability of small amounts of equity. Most venture capital companies are not able to provide such small sums economically. The Union of Independent Companies and Federation of Small Businesses have renewed their plea for a small business development bank which would provide inexpensive funds along the lines of the Bank for Reconstruction in Germany. Investment allowances. The chancellor announced a concession in his Autumn statement which permitted businesses to speed up the rate of depreciation for one year only, but business groups are seeking more fundamental alterations. The IOD believes special areas such as research and development spending should have more generous treatment. Together with the CBI, it thinks the accelerating pace of change makes established depreciation criteria look increasingly irrelevant. Is it still realistic, asks the IOD, to expect an industrial building to last for 25 years? It also calls for a change in government policy on what are quaintly known as 'nothings', a ragbag category of business expenses which the Revenue does not allow to be set against tax. They include abortive capital expenditure, lease payments on cars costing more than Pounds 8,000 and, most importantly, the costs of issuing equity capital. The abolition of the BES is an additional reason for a concession on the cost of issuing shares, the IOD says. Inheritance tax. The small business lobby has done quite well in this area in recent years but is keen to finish this tax off for good. Both the IOD and the chambers of commerce are seeking its complete abolition. Even in its present form this tax encourages business owners to retain their assets until death when it might be better for them to pass them earlier to the next generation, the chambers argue. Failing complete abolition, the rate should be halved to 20 per cent and the threshold doubled to Pounds 300,000, the IOD says. Compliance costs. The announcement last week of a comprehensive government campaign against red tape has been given a cautious welcome by the business community, which has nevertheless still targeted instances of bureaucracy in the budget submissions. A decision to levy National Insurance contributions retroactively on benefits in kind has forced many companies to check back through six years of accounts to bring themselves up to date, say the chambers. The different yardsticks that apply to PAYE and National Insurance contributions also complicate life for the small business owner. The heavy costs, in both time and money, incurred by the smaller company in administering VAT, PAYE and National Insurance, justify lower taxes for this sector, says the Forum of Private Business. The recession, coupled with a ballooning public sector borrowing requirement, means Norman Lamont has little scope for cutting taxes on March 16. The small business sector nevertheless believes it has a strong case for sympathetic treatment.

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs uneasy at Portillo's review 
text:  TORY BACKBENCHERS yes-terday argued for keeping large areas of the welfare state out of the government's strategic review of public spending priorities, as Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, outlined his plans in the Commons. In the Commons, Tory backbench concerns focused principally on the National Health Service and pensions. However, Tory MPs were privately voicing fears that the review would not achieve its aim of reassuring the markets. More than one commented that the government seemed to have no appetite for taking radical decisions, and that no crackdown on spending that was likely to be approved by the Commons would have enough impact on public borrowing. 'It's more than window-dressing, and it's essential but it won't get us out of the deficit problem. The only ways out of that are inflationary growth and extending the VAT base,' one backbencher said gloomily. The public warnings to Mr Portillo began with a contribution from Mr James Couchman, the Tory MP for Gillingham, who said the provision of healthcare free at the point of delivery was cherished by rich and poor alike. 'Any erosion of that principle would be resented very deeply throughout the country,' Mr Couchman cautioned. On pensions, Sir Anthony Grant, Conservative MP for Cambridgeshire South West, urged Mr Portillo to bear in mind that an increasing number of elderly people had based the last years of their lives on present figures. 'They are not in a position to make drastic changes at this stage of their life, and they don't expect to be let down,' Sir Anthony said. Labour's bitter opposition to the review was signalled by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary. She condemned it as a 'panic response' to the government's economic mismanagement. 'It would be wholly wrong if the British people, already suffering in this recession, ended up paying the price in worse policing, worse schools and worse healthcare, and in lost pensions and lost benefit,' she said. The prospect of alliances between Labour and some Tories has already been enough to blunt the cutting edge of last year's spending round, and some Tories believe the government's 21-seat majority will undermine the confidence which yesterday's statement that the government would tackle public spending was intended to create. 'They'll be tougher about spending for four years hence than they will for next year,' said one former minister. The only way to achieve spending cuts, according to one MP, was for the Treasury simply to present a stark choice: 'Ministers will have to give people the choice between cuts and income tax rises,' he said.

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tortoise plods out of hibernation - Ivo Dawnay tracks John Smith's first steps on a long election race 
text:  solid and reliable if maddeningly plodding. Last Sunday in Bournemouth, the Labour leader's speech to the party's local government conference marked the end of a long winter's contemplative hibernation and his first steps in the race for Downing Street. What seemed equally clear at Westminster yesterday was that the great majority of Labour MPs of both left and right were breathing a collective sigh of relief. But had Mr Smith's advocacy of an end to dogma been a clandestine announcement of the end of socialism? So long had the wait been for news, any news, from the leader's bunker, that no one appeared to care. All this says much about Mr Smith's leadership technique - a style about as far from the Kinnock 'bang the table first, ask questions afterwards' approach as it is possible to be. Yet if Mr Smith's agenda is to continue down the Kinnock path of reform, it is still wholly impossible to gauge how far he is ready to go. One theory - that of some opponents - has it that Mr Smith's highly conservative Scottish Labourism sees nothing essentially wrong with the party's positions but a good deal to criticise in the greedy, self-interested electorate. His aim is to broaden Labour's appeal to their baser interests while keeping the party's core objectives unchanged. The second view - largely that of his admirers - is that what has appeared to many to be indolence or complacency is in fact a grand, long-term and radical strategy. By keeping his counsel, Mr Smith has waited until the chorus of 'Something must be done' has neared a crescendo before authoritatively dictating that something will be. A painstaking textual analysis of the Bournemouth speech leaves the reader equally uncertain about the conclusions to be drawn. Mr Smith's call for 'a new politics that puts people first, that rejects dogma and embraces practical, common-sense solutions' is a case in point. It can either be interpreted as a lightly coded epitaph for socialism - a final burial of ideology in favour of a new individualism lightly sprinkled with social democratic altruism; or, alternatively, merely banal platform rhetoric. Most Labour MPs appear ready to embrace the broad sentiments. They liked the definition of the Labour task as 'to stand again and again for the frustrated ambitions of the majority of our people'. But there was also concern that the sandwich lacked a beefy filing of policy prescriptions. Today, the government's advocacy of further privatisation for such as British Rail and the Post Office appears to be, in Mr Smith's words, 'well beyond the limits of public approval and comprehension'. Yet that is a far from secure guarantee that by 1996-97 Labour will be able to sail to victory as the party of moderation and sound management and a popular hedge against Tory extremism. Nor is it by any means certain that Mr Smith's crusade against vested interests, whether in the privatised utilities, the City or among other elite groups, has any real resonance among the electorate. What seems more certain is that the scramble for the centre-ground of British politics is under way. Furthermore, in spite of the wailing in the wilderness stage from figures such as Mr Bryan Gould, most of the left are still aboard Mr Smith's creaky bandwagon - if sceptically so. Mr Alan Meale, the leftwing MP for Mansfield, commented: 'With Kinnock you could bargain; when Smith takes a decision you either play or you don't. The left must fight its corner from inside.' Nothing in Mr Smith's speech was wildly new. But by declaring the death of dogma, he has nonetheless pushed the party closer to the anti-ideological voters outside its ranks. 'It is,' said one prominent Labour moderniser, 'proof that things are moving in the right direction, but, Lord, why does it have to take so long.'

text:  MR JOHN SMITH confirmed yesterday that the Labour leadership would seek to derail the government's legislation implementing the Maastricht Treaty by defeating it over Britain's opt-out from the social chapter, Philip Stephens writes. His comments, published in today's issue of The Times, raised the possibility that an alliance of opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics could force the government either to drop ratification or to seek renegotiation of the treaty. Mr Smith insisted that Britain could still ratify the agreement if the government was defeated over the special protocol it negotiated to exclude it from the social provisions of the treaty. He said that other European states would allow the government to drop the opt-out protocol and then press ahead with ratification of the treaty. But that view was flatly rejected both by the government and by the Tory Euro-sceptics who are determined to defeat the treaty. Displaying a rare consensus, ministers and Tory back-bench rebels concurred that if Mr Smith was successful Mr John Major would be unable to ratify Maastricht. Ministers said that Denmark inevitably would take advantage of any renegotiation to seek the inclusion in a new treaty of the informal opt-outs from Maastricht it secured at last December's Edinburgh summit. In those circumstances the whole process might unravel. Senior Tory party managers acknowledged last night that the House of Commons vote on the social chapter, expected next month, would seriously threaten the government's majority. The Liberal Democrats have up to now indicated that they are prepared to vote with Labour against the government. But Mr Major may be able to rely upon the intense opposition of Tory constituency associations to the social chapter to limit the number of rebels on his own backbenches.

headline:  FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rising star fighting for the free market 
text:  ONE political winner has emerged from the government's planned review of public spending before it has started. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, has confirmed his status as the cabinet's fastest-rising star. It was he who suggested to colleagues last summer that the appalling state of government finances called for a fundamental reassessment of the way it spends Pounds 250bn a year of taxpayers' money. Most of big spenders were happy to sign up, persuaded that a long-term review was one of the safer ways to defer the awkward choices facing an increasingly spendthrift government in the midst of recession. They may come to regret that judgment. Mr Portillo had other ideas. Still three months from his 40th birthday he is the youngest, and technically the most junior minister in the cabinet. He is also one of its brightest, most hard-working and ideologically committed members - determined to advance in tandem his political career and the cause of aggressively free-market Conservatism. His review may serve both causes. Mr Portillo understands more clearly than many that the philosophical direction of any government depends crucially on the level of its spending commitments and the priorities to which they are aimed. Within a few months he will have a better grasp of the implications of present spending programmes than anyone else in government. The chief secretary appreciates also that economic chaos provides one of the most powerful forces for change in the Conservative party: it is only then that Tory MPs have to face up to the choice between unpalatable cuts in public spending and ruinous increases in taxation. So Mr Portillo used the launch of the review - focusing at first on the social security, health, education and home office budgets - to re-open the political debate about the limits of the welfare state. No one doubts where Mr Portillo stands personally. A conviction politician, he would like to see a further decisive tilt away from the state and towards the individual - in education, in social welfare and in health. He would like further cuts in taxation and closer targeting of welfare benefits. He is not so naive as to believe the review will transform overnight a timid government into a radical one. The state pension and child benefit - two main components of the welfare budget - are protected until the next election by manifesto commitments. But Mr Portillo understands that one of the lessons of the 1980s is that if the climate of opinion is carefully managed in advance the radical can be translated into the reasonable view. His sights are on the Tory party in 10 years. By then he could be leading it. A few Tory MPs are already tipping him to replace Mr Norman Lamont in a summer reshuffle. Such rapid promotion is probably premature. Mr Major may well be loath to mark him out as heir-apparent. But, as he stressed in the Commons yesterday, Mr Portillo is looking to the medium term.

He said the money would be used to reduce the burden of the council tax, which will replace the poll tax in April. Mr Hunt again insisted that the Pounds 2.6bn the government would provide for local government services in Wales in the coming financial year should ensure 'reasonable' council tax bills. He stressed that 90 per cent of all local authority revenue expenditure would be funded by central government support, and enable just over Pounds 900 to be spent on every man, woman and child in Wales. Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, strongly disputed the minister's claim that the level of grant should make it unnecessary for any local authority to cut capital spending programmes. Mr Davies maintained that the money being provided by the government would not be adequate to allow vital public services to be retained, and result, at a conservative estimate, in the destruction of some 2,500 jobs in the public sector.

text:  ABOUT 9.5m homes in the UK will be able to watch satellite television by the year 2000, the latest forecasts from Continental Research show. The number is down on the forecast made by Continental in November 1990, when the market research group thought the total would be 10.3m. The revision has been made because of slower growth last year. Of the 9.5m homes in the latest forecast - 45 per cent of the UK total  - 6.8m receive the new television channels via their own dish or communal aerial system and the remaining 2.7m from cable. The latest FT Satellite Monitor, produced by Continental Research, estimates that gross sales and rental of satellite dishes in January totalled 65,000 compared with 70,000 in January last year. Continental estimates that 17,000 of total retail sales last month were upgrades of equipment, replacements of existing equipment or renewals after a break in subscription. This gives a net increase for the month of 48,000. Continental also found a growth of interest from a low level in December with more than 300,000 households saying they would install satellite television. Interest may have been stimulated by satellite coverage of the present England cricket tour of India. The latest Continental figures coincide with the publication by Broadcasting Audience Research Bureau, which produces official broadcasting ratings, of a paper reviewing the work of the three organisations regularly monitoring the growth of the satellite television market. They are Continental, Barb and GfK, the German-owned market research group. BARB estimates are derived from 3,500 face-to-face interviews in the home each month and cover the entire UK for all forms of reception. Barb figures for February 1 estimate that 3.05m homes can receive satellite television, including all form of cable distribution. The latest figure for satellite dishes is 2.323m, an increase of 26,000 since the beginning of January. GfK, sponsored by the ITV Association, uses a series of 10,000 home random samples at six month intervals. These surveys are supplemented by projections from sales data obtained from retail audits and a sample of purchasing behaviour in 25,000 homes. GfK figures exclude Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which could add 50,000 to 60,000 dishes to the total. The latest GfK figures suggest that by November 21 dish ownership totalled 2.01m. Barb believes the single most important number for estimating the size of the emerging market is the number of satellite dishes for private homes.

Lord Justice Staughton, sitting with Mr Justice Buckley, rejected an appeal by Tesco, the supermarket chain, against a conviction by magistrates in Willesden, north London, for supplying an 18-rated film to a boy of 14. Lord Justice Staughton said the boy was given Pounds 10 by a trading standards official and told to buy a video with an 18 classification. He was told to give his true age if asked. The boy obtained the video and Tesco was later found guilty of a breach of the 1984 Video Recordings Act, fined Pounds 750 and ordered to pay Pounds 416 in costs. Tesco argued that if the boy was acting as an agent for the officer, the video was supplied to the official, not the boy, and was therefore lawful. Tesco said it was considering challenging the ruling in the House of Lords as 'a matter of general public importance'. Lord Justice Staughton said it was no doubt 'fairly common for children to arrive at shops and say they wish to buy cigarettes or alcohol for a parent or some of other adult, and the same may happen with video recordings'. Even if the child was telling the truth, it was doubtful that it could be said that the supply was to the adult and not the child.

The licence fee system means the BBC 'is not liable to any penalty for failure to provide what the general public want to see or for that matter to reap the rewards'. The study rejects the idea that there would not be enough advertising to support the BBC and the existing commercial broadcasters. As the BBC becomes a privatised corporation, public service broadcasting should be opened up to competition.

text:  LEGAL HISTORY was made yesterday with the first prosecution of a speeding driver based on evidence from the new controversial speed-trap cameras. According to police in west London the cameras, four of which are rotated at 42 sites, have cut accidents significantly since their introduction in October last year. At Ealing magistrates court Mr Stephen Quashie, 19, of Harlesden, north-west London, pleaded guilty to driving at 78mph on the A40 Western Avenue which has a 50mph limit. He told the court that on October 31 he had been rushing to see his pregnant ex-girlfriend in Hammersmith Hospital when he was caught on film. He said: 'It was 1.15am in the morning. There were hardly any cars on the road. I thought it would be all right.' He was fined Pounds 156, plus costs of Pounds 25, and given six penalty points. The chairman of the bench Wiktor Lewanski said the fine 'reflects the seriousness with which this offence is being viewed'. Afterwards Mr Quashie said he was surprised at the size of the fine but philosophical about the use of cameras. He added: 'They are there to do the job and they have done their job.' But he admitted he did not think he had been caught as he did not think there was a camera in spite of the police signs. Afterwards the police said: 'Since their introduction on October 15 there has been a 38 per cent drop in accidents, a 46 per cent drop in casualties and most spectacularly a 60 per cent drop in those killed or seriously injured.' He went on: 'Motorists have reduced their speed by about 10 per cent so accidents are that much less serious.' He denied they were being used to increase the number of drivers caught, pointing out their presence obviously reduced speed. On average 250 cases are being detected each week by the four cameras rotated in the 42 sites in west London.

text:  WORKERS who suffer from migraines cost their employers between Pounds 611m and Pounds 741m a year in lost working time and reduced productivity, according to research led by Dr Roger Cull, a consultant neurologist at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. There are an estimated 3.5m adult migraine sufferers in the UK, of whom about 2.3m are in work. The cost to the National Health Service of dealing with migraine is relatively small - between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m a year, says the Office of Health Economics. The study of the cost to employers, published in the British Journal of Medical Economics, found male sufferers lost an average of 5.6 working days because of attacks. That comprised 1.5 complete days off work and the equivalent of 4.1 days lost through reduced efficiency. Female sufferers lost an average of 6.7 days.

Lautro also said Liberty Life failed to control its internal affairs responsibly, and that it did not ensure its sales force was properly supervised. Liberty Life stopped recruiting sales staff for three months in mid 1992 to demonstrate to Lautro that its screening procedures had been reviewed. The company has only 408 representatives compared with a high of about 750 at the beginning of the decade. It has paid Pounds 5,000 compensation to 46 investors who were sold the wrong products. Mr David Pritchard, sales director of Liberty Life, said: 'We were very successful recruiting but that overswamped our personnel department.' It was right of Lautro to tighten up standards, he added. Mr Pritchard admitted that previously the company had not checked the financial background of its recruits as thoroughly as it should have done. The fine is the latest in a series of penalties imposed on life groups for inadequate control of separately managed tied agents. London &amp; Manchester was fined Pounds 80,000, Guardian Royal Exchange had to pay Pounds 100,000 and Scottish Widows was fined Pounds 120,000.

Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, proposes to orchestrate a Pounds 250,000 campaign involving lobbying and opposition in the courts. Ms Penny Hamilton, a partner in Coopers' VAT unit, said: 'This is a legally unsound policy which is uncertain in application. We are not going to give up to it without a fight.' Representatives of nearly 100 clients which are likely to lose tax rebates because of the decision, which comes into force in March, yesterday attended a campaign launch in London. Coopers intends to identify one of the consortium members, press Customs into making an assessment under the new arrangements and then take an appeal as far as the European Court of Justice, with financial backing from the other members. Customs issued a press release in October declaring that holding companies that own operating subsidiaries within a group would no longer be entitled to recover VAT incurred - mainly on professionals' fees - during their 'basic business activities'. Acquiring and disposing of shares, mounting or defending against takeovers and managing the affairs of subsidiaries would all be excluded from VAT recoveries under the tougher approach. The move by Customs followed interpretation by officials of the wider applications of a ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning a pure holding company called Polysar. Customs claimed the court's ruling determined that the mere purchase and holding of shares was not an economic or business activity and its role was therefore no different from that of a private shareholder. Opponents complain that Customs' new guidelines are unclear, inconsistent, highly costly and were announced only through press releases without any debate. A Coopers' proposal document circulated yesterday says the firm will lobby industry groups, ministers, government officials in London and Brussels and the press as part of the campaign.

Many national companies that had offered training, particularly to young people on Youth Training, pulled out of the scheme when Tecs took over responsibility for the government-funded programmes. Companies including Midland Bank and the Debenhams and Dixons retail groups complained that they had to sign separate and often widely differing contracts with up to 82 Tecs if they wanted to take on trainees round the country. Previously the government had contracted with them centrally through its National Providers Unit. The Department of Employment said yesterday the unit had not been privatised. Tecs and providers had 'disengaged' the responsibility from the government. According to an interview in Personnel Today, the magazine for specialist personnel staff, the new company will be called the National Training Partnership. Mr Roger Shaw, president of the British Printing Industry Federation, who will be one of the directors of the new body, said companies that had dropped out of Youth Training were expressing fresh interest. The government is expected within the week to announce the successor body to the National Training Task Force. The voluntary body, under the chairmanship of Sir Brian Woolfson, advised the government on establishing Tecs.

text:  A SENIOR British Rail manager hoping to lead a buy-out of one of BR's busiest InterCity routes has publicly denounced the government's privatisation plans as unworkable. Mr Brian Scott, director of InterCity's Great Western division, describes the proposed separation of track and operations as 'folly' and warns that a 'spiral of decline' caused by lack of investment will prevent anyone making profits from Great Western. The attack is significant because it comes from the head of one of the seven BR routes last week designated by the government as the first candidates for privatisation in 1994. Mr Scott plans to lead a management bid for the franchise to operate Great Western's main line services from London Paddington to much of south-west England and Wales. In letter to Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, Mr Scott says he is not against privatisation but believes impediments to running a successful private railway must be removed. His strongest criticisms are aimed at the government's plan to transfer control of the tracks from train operators to a new track authority. 'As an experienced, professional railway business manager I would not put my money into a train operating company - running a high-speed intensive service such as Great Western - without having day-to-day command and control of operations including signalling and track and track maintenance,' he said. 'Whoever runs the business would be committing an act of folly to buy into something with so little control of performance, and therefore, profit.' Mr Scott also attacked the climate for investment, saying the private sector will have no incentive to invest in assets with a lifespan of up to 30 years if franchises last only five to 10 years. Investment in Great Western, he says, needs to rise from Pounds 20m to Pounds 60m a year just to replace existing assets: 'If this increase in investment is not under way within three years, a spiral of decline will prevent anyone making profits on Great Western.' British Rail yesterday tacitly supported Mr Scott's criticisms by distributing copies of his letter to the media and acknowledging that it had been seen by Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, and Mr Chris Green, InterCity director. However, it said that Mr Scott was not writing on behalf of BR. The attack comes as MPs begin their consideration of the Railways Bill today. Observer, Page 17

Mr Heseltine added that he could not promise the environment committee that emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants would not increase because of the review, which is examining whether any of the 31 coal mines listed for closure in October can be saved. The UK is committed as part of EC policy and treaties signed at last July's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by the year 2000, and to curbing discharges of sulphur dioxide and of nitrogen oxides. Coal-fired power stations produce more of these pollutants than gas-fired or nuclear power stations, and British coal produces more than overseas coal. In answer to an accusation by Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich, that if the government reprieved some pits it would be 'virtually impossible' for it to keep to the targets, Mr Heseltine said that the white paper would address the issues and that they were also the responsibility of the environment and transport departments. He said the government targets were to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 15 per cent of 1980 levels by 1993 and by 30 per cent by 1998. But he said the government was not convinced that the technology to reduce these discharges now mandatory in Continental countries was the best available. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, added that the UK had spent Pounds 500m in the past five years on clean-coal technology. Asked why his statement in October on the British Coal cuts did not mention environmental issues, Mr Heseltine replied: 'One was concerned . . . with the coal industry and the local communities.'

text:  CONSTRUCTION companies working for the government may have to take a greater share of the economic risks in roadbuilding contracts, Mr Patrick Brown, permanent secretary at the Department of Transport, warned yesterday. He told members of the Commons public accounts committee that the cost of roadbuilding contracts had overshot their tender estimates by 28 per cent last year - equivalent to Pounds 85m. Most of this cost - which was borne by the department - had been due to unforeseen ground conditions or mistakes in design and construction, he said. Nevertheless, with the department facing criticism that it was failing to monitor these construction projects sufficiently, Mr Brown said pilot schemes were being run in which construction companies will bear the cost of any overrun themselves. 'We are not talking about simple cost overrun,' Mr Brown added, insisting that since roadbuilding was a 'dynamic piece of construction' it was impossible to assess the scale of these engineering risks at the time of the tender. Most of these overruns had occurred on the largest projects, he said. Additional sources of finance to fund Britain's roadbuilding programme may be needed by the end of the century if congestion on motorways and trunk roads is to be avoided, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told MPs yesterday. 'We have to see whether private finance can augment public finance,' he said, responding to opposition calls to clarify whether the government was considering introducing road tolls as an environmental measure or to raise Treasury revenues.

text:  THE NUMBER of profit-related pay schemes jumped by more than a quarter in the final three months of last year, according to figures released yesterday by the Inland Revenue. The number of schemes increased by 27 per cent from 3,268 to 4,149 by the end of December. Over the same period, the number of employees participating in registered schemes rose by 24 per cent from 780,600 to 973,000. The sharp rise comes after a long period of stability in the figures. However, the rise had been anticipated as anecdotal evidence had pointed to a substantial increase in inquiries about the schemes to accountants in the past few months. The new figures follow changes in the 1991 Budget which significantly increased the tax-free profit payments allowed under approved schemes. These are now possible up to either 20 per cent of pay or Pounds 4,000, whichever is lower. It may also reflect the fact that companies can use the schemes as a highly tax-efficient way to increase benefits to their employees at a time when profits are stagnating. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'These figures are very good news and strongly indicate that many employers are seeing the benefit of involving their employees in the running of the business.' Profit-related pay schemes were first introduced in 1988, and the formula by which each one increases employee pay has to be approved by the Revenue. Officials clamped down late last year on the abuse of some of these formulas.

text:  UNIONS FEAR that Leyland Daf's van production plant in Birmingham will close, although they believe its axle plant in Glasgow and its truck assembly plant in Leyland, Lancashire will be saved. The fears were voiced as the Dutch administrators of Daf, the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, warned that more than half of the jobs at the Dutch and Belgian operations would be eliminated. Mr Louis Deterink and Mr Friso Meeter, the court-appointed administrators, said the jobs would be cut as part of a rescue plan aimed at forming a new limited company - 'New Daf' - comprising the 'core operations' of Daf's Dutch and Belgian medium and heavy duty truck activities. The Dutch administrators said consultations had taken place with Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the joint UK administrative receivers of Daf 'to see if - and if so how - activities in the UK can be absorbed by New Daf.' It is understood that the Leyland plant would be the main candidate for inclusion in New Daf, although probably with a considerable cut in the 2,200 strong workforce. The overall fate of the UK operations with more than 5,500 jobs therefore remains uncertain. The receiver is expected to announce a decision this Friday, and the unions are preparing an intense lobbying campaign over the next few days. Today Leyland Daf shop stewards are to meet Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and union officials tomorrow are due to have discussions with the receiver. On Thursday union leaders travel to Eindhoven for talks with the main Daf board in the Netherlands. The Birmingham van plant with its 2,000 jobs appears most at risk - Daf was facing an investment of about Pounds 100m to modernise it for a new van range that had been under development with Renault of France. But jobs are also at risk outside the UK. Daf has more than 5,000 employees at Eindhoven in the Netherlands and about 1,500 employees at Westerlo, Belgium, where it assembles cabs and axles. The administrators said they expected the total number of these jobs to be 'at least halved'. The administrators said Daf Finance, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Daf group, would be 'run down and closed'. They did not specify if this included Leyland Daf Finance, its UK subsidiary, which is not in receivership in the UK but which last week closed its five UK regional offices. British union leaders are particularly concerned about the prospect that members losing jobs in Daf's UK operations might receive no redundancy pay. The TGWU general union estimates that - if the company met its redundancy obligations - it would cost Pounds 27m for a complete closure of all the plants. As Leyland Daf is in the hands of the receiver, no company redundancy money will be forthcoming. Workers will be able to receive only state redundancy help after 14 weeks. Daf, which has more than 12,650 jobs mainly in the UK, the Netherlands and in Belgium, was forced to file for protection from its creditors last week after running up losses of more than Fl 800m in the past three years.

text:  CONSTRUCTION companies desperate to win work and generate cash are bidding prices on average 10 per cent below what jobs are expected to cost, Gardiner &amp; Theobald, the leading firm of quantity surveyors, said yesterday. Gardiner &amp; Theobald warned that customers which accepted unrealistic prices could suffer as contractors then sought to recover their costs as work progressed. Mr Tony Burton, a partner, said: 'Either contractors will go bust or they will have to find another way of squeezing cash out of the job. This could be achieved by trying to pass the pain on to subcontractors which themselves could fail; or, by pursuing legal claims for extra payments because of variations introduced to original designs which arise on almost every job. Either way it is unlikely to be good news for the customer.' Gardiner &amp; Theobald, which publishes price indices that are quarterly based on reports from more than 2,000 specialist contractors, warned that fixed-price jobs could come under pressure if building material prices rose because of sterling's devaluation or reduced capacity among domestic suppliers. The firm estimated that imported materials accounted for between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the cost of a commercial development. It said: 'In theory the devaluation of the pound could add 4 per cent to 5 per cent to the cost of a project. It is unlikely, however, that the full effect will be passed on and there is evidence that overseas contractors are finding that they can no longer afford to tender in sterling in the UK market.' The recession had led to closures and mothballing of plants by building material suppliers and the erosion of over-capacity should see prices rise, they added. Mr Burton said: 'One cladding company recently reported that it had reduced its operations so much that if they were to win one more large project they would be at full capacity and therefore able to consider raising their prices. 'A steel contractor reported that his sector of the industry was at last getting the message that buying business is a fruitless exercise and that prices are tending to rise as a consequence.' Gardiner &amp; Theobald forecasts that tender prices would rise by 3 per cent this year after a fall of 1 per cent last year. It said that construction tenders had fallen by an average 30 per cent in real terms since 1989. Increases in the price of steel, glass and plasterboard have been announced by building material producers in the past month. Of these, the plasterboard increases, announced by BPB Industries, Europe's biggest producer, seem most likely to stick. Rises announced by British Steel and Pilkington are likely to face opposition from contractors which will seek alternative suppliers overseas.

text:  PRIVATE LANDLORDS and tenants with long leases will today renew their battle to swing the government's leasehold reforms in their favour, when all MPs have their first chance to discuss and vote on the details of the plans. Groups of Tory backbenchers on both sides of the argument have put down amendments to the Housing and Urban Regeneration Bill, which includes giving tenants the right to club together to buy the freehold of their block of flats or the right to extend their leases. Labour is unlikely to support changes to favour the landlords, so it is the moves on behalf of the tenants' lobby that threaten the government's 21 majority. Potential Tory rebels say up to 20 backbench Tories are sympathetic to their cause. The point on which ministers are most likely to give way - and most are reconciled to doing so - is abandoning the low-rent test provision. This is one of the proposed criteria to determine whether leaseholders qualify for the right to buy the freehold of the property, but the rebels argue that the rule is artificial. Ministers have argued that the purpose of the low-rent rule is to distinguish between long leases where the tenant pays a premium at the beginning and then pays a low ground rent, and the different sort of interest held by a tenant who is on a long lease but paying a market rent. Only properties with a low ground rent qualify under the proposals. The tenants' lobby is also renewing its pressure on the government to change the rule which means that tenants would not qualify if more than 10 per cent of the property was in non-residential use. On the landlords' side, Tory MPs led by former ministers including Sir Jerry Wiggin and Mr Kenneth Baker have proposed changes that restrict the new rights to flats which are the principal residence of tenants. However, ministers are unlikely to accept the change. In spite of the prospect of rebellions, government whips do not believe that the legislation itself is in jeopardy because it fulfils so many manifesto commitments. Instead, the landlords' lobby will simply step up their efforts to win changes in the Lords, where the bill will be discussed shortly.

The all-party Treasury and Civil Service committee, said yesterday that the idea of a 'budgetary green paper' will be among the issues it will consider ahead of the unified Budget in December. 'A great chunk of every finance bill is taken up with merely correcting mistakes of the past Budget,' said Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the committee. 'Obviously some things would have to be kept secret but much of the finance bill is about technical changes which involve no pecuniary advantage for anyone.' The committee will also consider the impact of the unified Budget - the Budget and Autumn Statement combined - on the timing of taxation decisions, the implications for Treasury forecasting, the timing of the financial year and the timing and progress through parliament of the finance bill, which implements the Budget proposals. In particular the committee will discuss what the December Budget means for the timing of the local authority financial settlement announcement. Mr Watts said MPs were worried that councils might receive very late notification of what resources were available to them, making it difficult to plan for the future. The UK's longer leading index, which indicates turning points in the economy about 11 months in advance, rose slightly in December. The Central Statistical Office said the rise was due to the reduction in interest rates since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Higher share prices and an improvement in business optimism also boosted the index. The shorter leading index, pinpointing turning-points about four months in advance, has also risen. This followed increases in new car registrations and the results of the Confederation of British Industry survey of new orders and expected changes in stocks of materials. The coincident index, which tracks the business cycle, has hesitated, according to the CSO, following its rise since spring 1992.

text:  OFFICIALS from the five local authorities in Merseyside are pressing for the region to be made a special case for development by the European Commission because they say it is as economically weak as Corsica, Northern Ireland, the Scottish Highlands and Molise in southern Italy - and getting weaker. The officials want the EC to award the region with 'Objective 1' status so that it qualifies for large-scale investment of community funds over the next eight years. The money would be for economic development to counter 25 per cent male unemployment. Objective 1 status is reserved for the EC's weakest areas. These are defined as those that have a gross domestic product a head of only 75 per cent of the EC average over a three-year period. Merseyside's GDP a head fell to an average of 79 per cent of the EC average in 1989-90, the latest review period, from 86 per cent in the mid 1980s. The EC can award the status above the 75 per cent level in exceptional circumstances. This has already happened in Northern Ireland (currently at 76 per cent) and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (79 per cent). Although GDP a head in Merseyside is rising at present, the growth is at a slower rate than elsewhere in the community, hence the region is falling further behind. Almost one-third of manufacturing jobs in Merseyside were lost between 1979 and 1990. One in four men is now unemployed and overall employment is 70 per cent lower than the EC average and 50 per cent less than in the rest of the UK. Latest census data shows a 9 per cent drop in population between 1981 and 1991, against a rise of 2 per cent for the UK as a whole. Much of the migration away from the region is of skilled or adaptable younger people. The officials from the local authorities of Liverpool, Bootle, St Helens, Wirral and Sefton, say that forecasts for employment and population in the region to the end of the century suggest a greater decline than anywhere else in the UK. The situation is therefore projected to worsen. Objective 1 status is currently automatic for the whole of the Republic of Ireland (65 per cent), Portugal (55 per cent) and Greece (48 per cent). It also applies in Corsica and Molise - both 79 per cent - and Abruzzi, also in southern Italy, where regional GDP is 88 per cent of the EC average. The authority officials have made their case to the UK government, which is reviewing the amount of assistance given to the region. It is hoped that Merseyside's position will be considered by the EC's Council of Ministers in June.

text:  BORROWING BY individuals for consumer purchases rose for the second consecutive month in December, pointing to a slight improvement in willingness to take on new debts. Official figures out yesterday showed that consumers borrowed a net Pounds 56m in December, compared with net borrowings of Pounds 13m in November and a net repayment of Pounds 138m in December 1991. The better-than-expected figures were released as the latest consensus forecast for UK growth this year crept upwards. Average GDP forecasts among 34 economists, provided by Consensus Economics, a consultancy company, was for growth of 1 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent next year. This year's forecast has been revised upwards from last month's mean of 0.9 per cent. Forecasts for France, Germany and Italy have been revised downwards. The Central Statistical Office said the total rise in net credit in the three months to the end of December was Pounds 136m compared with a net repayment of Pounds 11m in the previous quarter. This suggests that lower interest rates encouraged consumers to borrow more but did not stimulate a rapid recovery in consumer spending. The Treasury said the figures were encouraging: 'The figures suggest a rise in borrowing by consumers in December accompanied by prudent reductions in indebtedness.' The seasonally adjusted figures - which do not include mortgages and account for only about 15 per cent of total private sector debt - also showed a small increase in the amount of new credit advanced to consumers by finance houses, building societies and on credit cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system. In December new credit advanced was Pounds 4.67bn, slightly higher than November's Pounds 4.06bn. Although the latest figures are slightly more optimistic, the level of consumer borrowing remains depressed. A broader measure of credit growth, which includes bank loans on personal accounts and lending by non-bank credit cards, painted a more sombre picture. This showed a slowing in net consumer credit growth in the latest quarter compared with the third quarter last year. In the three months to the end of December, consumer lending according to this measure expanded by Pounds 153m compared with Pounds 392m in the previous three-month period. The figures underlined expectations for a slow economic recovery as consumers continue to make debt repayment a priority.

text:  As growth of the world's pharmaceuticals market continues to decelerate, so research and development managers are being forced to be more focused in the way they direct their companies R&amp;D efforts. 'I think R&amp;D spending will slow down,' says Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive of Merck. 'Over the last 15 years, R&amp;D has grown at about 14 per cent a year. I'd love that to continue, but it's no longer an option.' Most groups are responding to the new environment by reducing the number of therapeutic categories they explore. Admittedly, a few, giant groups, can continue to cover most areas. Dr Edward Scolnick, president of Merck Research Laboratories, says: 'You can do research in most things in most therapeutic areas. It doesn't cost that much.' Other companies, without the benefit of an R&amp;D budget of more than Dollars 1bn a year, and 1,800 people working in discovery, are being forced to concentrate their efforts. 'You have to be at the leading edge of the areas you're researching and you have to be focused,' says Mr Lodewijk de Vink, president and chief operating officer of Warner-Lambert. 'It'll be like the biotechnology industry. You'll soon be talking about burn-out rate for those pharmaceuticals companies still looking at all areas.' Choosing which therapeutic areas to investigate is far from easy - 'the hardest decision you have to make is which areas to explore,' says Dr William Scott, senior vice-president exploratory drug discovery research at Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'It's like a kid going into a candy store with a credit card. You can kill yourself. You have to be very focused.' Many R&amp;D directors continue to duck the difficult decisions. Although they claim they are more focused than before, the areas they continue to explore cover most human diseases. An R&amp;D director whose researchers are looking at inflammatory diseases can cover diseases as diverse as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel syndrome. When choosing which areas to cover, there are a large number of criteria adopted by companies. The most important are probably medical need and biological science, according to Dr Scolnick - 'biologically you have to understand the basic physiology - what the disease mechanisms are. We find projects with the right combination of scientific understanding and medical need and then we set to work.' Dr Takao Tanakaya, executive director drug discovery division at Fujisawa, agrees: 'You have to understand the basic pathology of the disease. Although Alzheimer's looks interesting because there's a huge potential market, we've steered clear of dementia because we don't understand what's going on. That means it's difficult to develop anything really innovative.' Some companies also try to match unmet needs with the their expertise. At Schering-Plough, management will only work in areas that match the company's strengths, where the group has sufficient critical mass to make a difference, according to Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president clinical research. The demand for new treatments for diseases in the elderly, such as osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's has attracted many companies. Dr Teruhisa Noguchi, executive vice-president for R&amp;D at Yamanouchi, explains: 'We've decided to concentrate on cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal and central nervous system diseases, as well as endocrinology, diabetes and bone disorders. They're all linked to the ageing population which is a real problem in Japan.' But there are dangers in focusing only on untreated and unexplored areas. Some groups see the need to balance the risks between different therapeutic categories. Dr Spiegel at Schering-Plough explains: 'There are some discovery areas where we are quite comfortable that if we invest the money and have the patience, products will come out. 'But there are others that are high risk areas that are scientifically exciting and could be of great potential yield, if you hit it right.' 'The problem is that the new areas are really difficult,' says Dr Spiegel. 'In brand new fields, the regulatory and clinical environments are unknown. 'Take Alzheimer's: until Parke Davis had Cognex approved, nobody knew what sort of efficacy the FDA wanted. There had never been a drug approved in that area before. You have to have a balance of risk.' A number of companies have cut the number of therapeutic areas in a meaningful way. SmithKline Beecham's exit from gastro-intestinal disease more than 12 months ago - it was an area that virtually created its predecessor SmithKline French - was probably the most dramatic. However, Wellcome has also moved out of tropical diseases, and Dr Trevor Jones, director of research, development and medical, says the group will stop developing new anaesthetics once it has completed its present generation of products. Dr Pierre Simon, R&amp;D director at Elf Sanofi, explains his company's decision to concentrate on only three areas. 'Seven years ago, Sanofi was present in all areas of research. I told the chairman it was stupid  - you can't do all that effectively because development is becoming more and more sophisticated and expensive. Instead, we decided to concentrate on just three areas.' Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, says: 'We'll have to cut some areas over the next few years. We won't scale back on cardiovascular or oncology, and we have a very major position in dermatology. 'We'll also stake our future on immunological areas, but in central nervous system diseases and diagnostics we cannot lead. Now that there's a bright light shining down on everything we do, we have to concentrate on those areas where we are leaders and have greatest strengths.' Once the therapeutic areas have been chosen, the R&amp;D directors next difficulty is to decide which of the many compounds competing for limited developed resources should be selected. 'For the last while, we have only pursued those new therapies that will produce a clear medical benefit. We will only develop those with a distinct advantage,' says Dr Paul Herrling, head of research at Sandoz. 'There's much more scrutiny than there used to be about the quality of the drugs in development,' agrees Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice president clinical research at Schering-Plough. 'You have to look at what the market will bear for a product which is only a minor improvement.' 'The medicines have to add value, otherwise we're not prepared to spend time and money on them,' says Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo. Dr Scolnick agrees: 'You have to have uniqueness in discovery, otherwise you end up selling generic drugs.' Dr Simon adds that he recently cut some beta-blockers and H2-antagonists from his pipeline even though they were safe and effective - 'they made no sense because they were little better than existing therapies.' he says. Similarly, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer last year cut a safe and effective 5HT-3 antagonist similar to Glaxo's highly successful Zofran, because it was no better than existing compounds, according to Mr Robert Cawthorn, chief executive. Some groups abandon even promising and innovative projects, however. Dr Simon at Elf Sanofi explains: 'When you are using biochemical screening you come up with interesting compounds that do not fit exactly in the areas where you want to work. 'We came up with a good asthma drug, but we had no intention of getting into asthma. We want to license it out. The problem is one of timing. If you talk to early, you haven't much to say. If you're too late you lose time. You have to have good clinical trials to show it's good and then sell out quickly.' Most R&amp;D directors agree it is far easier to develop good quality drugs than poor ones. Dr Masaji Ohno, managing director of R&amp;D at Eisai, agrees: 'Our chairman, Mr Yuji Naito, asks us to find compounds that are so good they develop themselves.' At Sanofi, Dr Simon adds: 'You have to set high standards to get compounds into development. We look at strength, oral activity, duration of action, the toxicology and genotoxicity. 'We also make sure the molecule can be metabolised in man. The drug has to clear the bar, even if it's set high.' Production costs are also an important issue, according to Dr Herrling. 'You have to look at how complicated the molecule is and how many steps it takes to synthesise. The cost and complexity of manufacture is becoming much more important,' he says. Dr Stephen Carter, senior vice-president worldwide clinical research and development at Bristol-Myers Squibb agrees: 'If it's going to takes 15 chemical steps to produce a compound, I might need 20 chemists full-time working for a year to generate enough for a clinical trial. If that's the case, I might not put it into development.' The potential market of a drug is also clearly important. Dr Noguchi at Yamanouchi says his company has set a target of minimum annual sales of Y2bn  -about Dollars 200m - for drugs to move into development. One consequence of the new cost-conscious environment is that decisions about the future of molecules are made much earlier than before. 'Just recently we discontinued a couple of compounds which in earlier times we would have continued to see what happened to them. Today, we just don't have the luxury of doing that,' says Dr Spiegel at Schering-Plough. However, although most companies pay lip-service to the over-riding drive towards innovation, most R&amp;D directors admit they need to balance their portfolios for risk. In Japan, these low-risk, low-reward, compounds are called survival drugs, according to Dr Masaji Ohno, managing director of R&amp;D at Eisai. 'Let's be honest about this,' agrees Dr Carter at Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'If you just go for high-risk, high-reward blockbusters, you're just going for home runs. That's not necessarily good for business. 'You have to have singles and doubles to support the franchises. You need to balance across the franchises and across the risk. A Dollars 100m product in an old franchise is more valuable than a Dollars 150m product in a new area.' Few companies admit setting out to create me-too drugs. However, Dr Spiegel admits that when you set out to find something exciting you sometimes only come up with a drug offering marginal improvements. An important area little stressed by R&amp;D directors publicly is that of line extensions. 'We call the process evergreening,' says Dr John Niblack, president Pfizer central research. Dr Carter at Bristol-Myers Squibb agrees: 'Line extensions help quality of life and generate increased exclusivity for the company. 'Besides, developing line extensions is easier than developing new compounds because the safety is already proven - you just have to show efficacy. We don't have to spend a lot of money on this, but it's worthwhile.'

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (4): Speed is imperative - Cutting the time it takes to bring a new molecule to market remains one of the industry's most important priorities / Bringing drugs to market 
text:  It is imperative to speed products to market, says Dr Stephen Carter, senior vice president of worldwide clinical research and development - 'you're dealing with a finite patent life during which you can market the drug exclusively. That's the period during which you can gain a return on your investment. 'Even if it costs more 'up front,' saving time can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.' The need to accelerate drug development has become even more acute over the last 12 months, according to Dr Edward Scolnick, president of Merck Research Laboratories. 'Cost containment and therapeutic substitution has shortened effective patent life,' he explains. 'Look at Pravachol and Mevacor (two cholesterol drugs) - they're competing on price. Although its patents are still valid, they've lost their effective patent life. When Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten comes off patent, we expect the healthcare companies won't be willing to pay the difference for our competitor product Vasotec, even though they won't be prescribing the best medicine. We'll lose our effective patent.' The difficulty is that although the drugs groups want to bring products to market as quickly as possible, the regulatory hurdles facing them are increasing all the time. The regulatory process is becoming increasingly complex and demanding, says Dr Carter. 'Just take the fact that you now have to do trials using active control compounds so you can compare the new molecule against the old ones. 'Now you not only have to show that the drugs work, you have to show they work better than the existing therapies. That often means large trials involving large numbers of patients. And the fact that regulatory authorities are asking for clinical end-points, rather than just surrogate markers. Add on to that the requirements for health economics data. It's becoming really expensive and time-consuming,' he laments. Dr Carter admits that one counter-trend is the US Food and Drug Administration's willingness to accelerate approval for life-threatening diseases such as Aids when there's no available therapy. But this is an exception, he argues. Another problem is co-ordinating development on a worldwide basis. The costs of development are so high that it is no longer possible to achieve a reasonable return from just the European, or Japanese, or US market. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer has taken this on board. It is throwing all its resources at the international development of Taxotere, its new cancer compound. 'We will be filing the new drug applications in north America, Europe and Japan within three months of each other. We've never done that before,' says Mr Robert Cawthorn, chief executive. Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's director of research, development and medical, explains: 'Five years ago, Japan wasn't even on the agenda for our company. Now it's a central part of our thinking and we've 65 clinical scientists working on phase III trials.' Similarly, some Japanese groups, such as Fujisawa, are busy trying to establish international development capabilities. Bristol-Myers Squibb has now reached the stage where it prepares one core dossier for Europe and the US. 'A long time ago we used to file a new drug application in the US, and then look at Europe. 'We know what's required for the individual markets, but it's far more efficient with a core dossier,' says Dr Carter. When Bristol-Myers Squibb prepares assays for the European and US regulatory authorities, it conducts them at Japanese standards, even though the drug may never be developed for that market - 'if we do decide to take the product to Japan, it can save us 18 months,' he says. One of the most important elements in achieving speed to market is ensuring the compounds picked for development are good ones. 'When the benefits of a drug are incremental rather than dramatic, then approval becomes a lot tougher. The major breakthroughs are much quicker,' says Dr Carter. Once the compounds have been chosen, the R&amp;D director is then faced with the problem of allocating scarce resources to competing projects. 'You have to prioritise. Otherwise you're dead,' says Dr Carter. 'Dollars spent on useless compound X, means fewer dollars spent on potential blockbuster Y' Most drugs groups have been developing far fewer compounds than in the past. Bristol-Myers Squibb reckons it has cut the number of compounds in the pipeline by a third in recent years. At Upjohn, the number of compounds being developed has been cut from 74 three years ago to 34, according to Dr John McCall, executive director of discovery research. Cutting drugs in development is not easy, however. 'It's really easy to start a programme,' says Dr William Scott, senior vice-president exploratory drug discovery research at Bristol-Myers Squibb - 'the difficult part is knowing when to kill it. You have to set stringent go-no-go decisions. And you have to make those decisions as early as possible. You can save a lot of time and money that way. You have to be tough. You want to add to the portfolio as much as possible, making it as rich as possible. So you have to have strict criteria to make sure all the compounds are competitive,' he says. Dr Carter explains: 'One of the hardest problems is knowing when to say 'no'. Your teams invest years of their lives. They will come up with all sorts of alternative approaches to save the project. 'They will always ask for one more trial. But you have to be surgical. You have to put the bullet into the brain. Then you turn them on to something else. You have to have a culture that says you personally have not failed, it was the project that failed. Human nature being what it is, they tend not to believe you. And I can't deny that success helps career development.' Once the compounds have been chosen, all resources must be allocated to them. Sir Richard Sykes, Glaxo chief executive, explains: 'If you have priority molecules you have to get them to market as quickly as possible. Take our neuraminidase inhibitor (for treating 'flu). It's important so it gets 100 per cent attention. We will spare no expense bringing that drug through the system.' 'Allocating resources and making these judgments is the most important part of my job,' says Dr Scolnick. 'On the top-priority drugs, nothing should rate-limit the process. When we were developing Mevacor (a cholesterol-lowering drug and fourth-biggest selling medicine in 1992) there were concerns about its safety. The drug was in limbo. So we threw resources at it. Half of the dogs we had were allocated to testing Mevacor's safety - you can't do that with more than two drugs.' One rate-limiting problem can be manufacture - 'traditionally, you'd make, say, 5kg of a drug for a trial,' says Dr Carter at Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'And if the trial looked good you'd make another 5kg. For a potential blockbuster, we'd make it all at the start. In the past, if you didn't do that, you'd save money, but by hedging your bets, it might take two years longer to develop the compound. You have to plan for success rather than failure.' Drawing up a design for the clinical trials and then sticking to it is also important, according to Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president, clinical research at Schering-Plough. 'The major improvement comes from having an agreed aim when you start the process, and then - it's going to sound like a cliche - doing it right first time. You have to make sure everyone agrees what you're trying to do and then not make too many changes so you can avoid being forced to go back to scratch and start again,' he says. One technique used by European and US groups - though not Japanese ones - is parallel development. Dr Spiegel explains: 'It depends on the product. Either you can wait until you've completed the dose-ranging study and then start the pivotal phase three study, or you can start the pivotal study early, using three or four doses. That takes more resources, but it can be really effective in compressing and telescoping the process. 'Although we might have accrued between 50 and 100 per cent more patients than we might have done normally, and even taken a little longer over the pivotal trial, we could shave two or even three years off waiting for the results of the first dose-ranging trial.' However, not all are convinced of the need to be first. Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive of Merck, says: 'It's nice to be first, but it's best to be best. Our ace-inhibitor Vasotec overtook Capoten (Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug) because it's a better drug. There's nothing better out there.'

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (3): Big change in attitudes - One of the fastest growing aspects of pharmaceutical R&amp;D is contract research 
text:  Contract research has expanded from a small cottage industry in the mid-1970s to a business whose worldwide turnover is now estimated at Dollars 3bn a year. Contract research organisations - known generally as CROs - span the whole spectrum of pharmaceutical R&amp;D. In the discovery phase, they synthesise tiny quantities of research chemicals and help to elucidate the pharmacological action of new molecules. But their biggest contribution comes in clinical development; indeed, some of the larger CROs have built up clinical departments as large as those in medium-sized pharmaceutical companies. Toxicology and laboratory analysis are the most mature sectors of the CRO market, in which companies routinely contract out work. A book just published* by Technomark, a London consultancy, contains what is claimed to be the first comprehensive analysis of the international contract research industry. It shows that there about 1,000 CROs worldwide, of which at least 20 have revenues exceeding Dollars 20m a year. Richard Wyse and Graham Hughes, the Technomark authors, estimate that the European CRO industry has a turnover of about Dollars 900m, of which the UK accounts for Dollars 400m. Britain is the preferred location for drug development programmes, they say, because of the strength of its scientific expertise, its health and academic infrastructure and, above all, its favourable legislative and economic conditions. Factors fueling the rapid growth in contracting out include: Regulatory and legislative changes which require pharmaceutical companies to carry out larger and more wide-ranging studies. Globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry; CROs have local knowledge and skills which can be very attractive to, say, a Japanese drug company trying to expand into Europe. Growth of biotechnology companies which have little in-house experience of the complex process of clinical development and cannot afford to staff their own overseas offices. Strategic decisions by many pharmaceutical companies to use CROs for certain areas of R&amp;D, so as to accelerate development and cut costs. Increasing recognition by the industry that CROs represent a valuable source of expertise. Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, explains why CROs are so useful  -'in R&amp;D, there's a baseline level of activity and then there are peaks and troughs. It's important not to staff up for the peaks,' he says. 'The idea is generally to contract out for the peaks; that way we can keep a lean machine.' That is the classic justification for contracting-out. Dr Pierre Simon, R&amp;D director of Elf Sanofi, puts it similarly: 'Development comes in waves. We want to use our development capacity at 100 per cent,' he says. 'Anything over 100 per cent and we turn to CROs. That's better than hiring new people. This is an unstable world. I'd prefer not to hire people and then fire them a couple of years later.' Japanese drug companies with global ambitions have particular reason to contract out clinical development overseas. 'We already use CROs in the US,' says Mr Masaji Ohno, managing director for R&amp;D at Eisai. 'We aren't sure in Europe yet. There's no tradition of CROs in Japan, but they make it very easy to enter clinical trials. It allows us to avoid building up an expensive infrastructure overseas.' Mr Mitsuhiko Sentoku, director of planning and development for Daiichi, agrees. 'We can acquire very good clinical data in London - we're putting one of our leading products Cravit through CROs in Europe. That avoids having to build up important infrastructure.' Sir Richard Sykes draws a clear distinction between contracting-out and collaborative research. 'Contracting-out is for a specific task; we lay down the parameters and we pay for it,' he says. 'That's quite different from collaboration, where there's a close flow of information between us and our partners.' In 1992/93, Glaxo spent Pounds 183m on research, of which Pounds 39m went to external organisations - mainly collaborative partners. In the same year, the company spent Pounds 556m on development, of which Pounds 128m was external - mainly contracted out. 'Our major competitors are still the pharmaceutical companies themselves, rather than other CROs,' says Dr John Mills, senior vice-president for Europe at Besselaar - one of the largest CROs with 1,100 employees worldwide. 'In some companies the medical directors are resistant to contracting-out because they think they will lose control by handing work over to us. People are not yet as open with us as they could be.' Even so, Dr Mills says, there has been a huge change in attitudes over the past 20 years. 'When I started out in the industry, you contracted-out the bits which you really didn't want to do or which you were afraid might fail. 'Contracting was regarded as a rather mucky end of the business - and not very exciting. We're much more respectable now.' Mr Simon Garnham, who founded Chiltern International in 1982 and has seen it grow into a substantial European CRO, describes another change. 'The market has developed from a very immature, not to say casual, situation 10 to 15 years ago when significant clinical research expenditures were often made on the basis of discussions and a simple exchange of letters, to a point today where sophisticated 30-page legal agreements accompanied by full product specifications and costings are more the norm.' Most people in the contract research industry expect it to continue growing in the years ahead, though not as quickly as over the past two decades. 'The minimum critical mass necessary to undertake larger projects today is somewhere of the order of 100 staff, spread amongst a balance of departments giving really quite significant drug development capabilities,' says Mr Garnham. 'But by trying to keep the size of functional groups modest, say between 20 and 30, it is possible for contractors to respond to clients better and for clients to identify better with those groups who are providing services. 'Overall, the market today is still very fractured.' he says. 'In 20 years' time, people in business schools will probably look back and refer to this as a classic situation of an immature market developing and polarising into a relatively small number of relatively large players who dominate the game, together with a relatively large number of small players to provide highly specialised services - in particular, therapeutic or geographical areas.' *Pharmaceutical Contract Research in the 1990s, Pounds 250; from Technomark, King House, 5-11 Westbourne Grove, London W2 4UA.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (2): Combination of brains and brawn - Drug discovery, the first phase of pharmaceutical research, is being reshaped by several strong technological forces / Research trends 
text:  Two of the most powerful factors in pharmaceutical research may seem to be leading in different directions. One is the ability to screen vast numbers of molecules - which may be natural products or synthetic chemicals - ever more rapidly for useful pharmacological activity. The other is the use of computers to design an individual molecule to fit perfectly into a particular biochemical slot, such as a receptor site on an enzyme. There are indeed companies focusing hard on one or other of these approaches. For example, Affymax of Palo Alto, California, has pioneered a technique to make and test millions of new compounds, by putting together peptides from random combinations of amino acids. The pharmaceutical industry is suddenly showing great interest in creating huge 'chemical libraries' of this sort for mass screening. At the other extreme is Agouron, based further south in La Jolla, California. It is a leading exponent of 'rational drug design' by computer. The company says its anti-cancer drug AG-337, now in clinical trials, is the first in the world developed from scratch by computational chemistry, without reference to existing compounds. Agouron designed AG-337 to inhibit thymidylate synthase, an enzyme required by rapidlydividing cancer cells. But most drug companies are combining brains and brawn in their approach to drug discovery, says Dr Trevor Nicholls, European managing director of Amersham Life Science, a UK-based supplier of research tools to the pharmaceutical industry - 'some of our customers are using both approaches in tandem. They look for a good shape to fit a particular receptor, through the principles of rational drug design, and synthesise many molecules with the same general shape. Then they use 'high throughput screening' to find the best of this rationally chosen bunch.' Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, agrees that the use of chemical libraries in this way has enormous potential - 'if you have a target - if you have identified a receptor or enzyme, you can clone its gene and crystallise the resulting protein. Then you can look at the active site and say: this is the sort of molecule you can fit into it. With chemical libraries, you can make thousands of variants and see whether by iteration you can get a better and better fit. 'You're limited at the moment with chemical libraries - they consist mainly of peptides - but as the technology develops you will be able to make thousands of variations of these molecules instead of needing medicinal chemists to make them. Then the fine tuning would be done by medicinal chemists,' Sir Richard says. Glaxo launched a chemical libraries initiative last year. In the US the company has an ambitious programme to synthesise a million small molecules. In the UK, Glaxo is concentrating on building up chemically diverse collections of organic molecules that might be developed into drugs. Sir Richard says chemical libraries and their associated technologies will enable research chemists to spend less time on the routine aspects of organic synthesis and more on the creative medicinal aspects of chemistry. Meanwhile laboratory automation, together with new techniques such as Amersham's Scintillation Proximity Assay, is rapidly speeding up the rate of screening. 'People are regularly running assays with up to 10,000 samples on a single screening run, which can be completed within a day,' Dr Nicholls says. 'Some companies are now looking to increase that by a factor of 10, for example by mixing several compounds in a single well. If you get a 'hit' in a particular well, you then separate the compounds out and test them individually.' Dr John McCall, executive director of discovery research at Upjohn, says his company is 'now using recombinant technology to screen as many as 12,000 compounds in a day - which used to take 12 to 15 months. That represents one of the biggest revolutions in molecular biology.' Both mass screening and rational drug design share a common underlying technology: genetic engineering. They are feasible because 'recombinant DNA' techniques enable researchers to clone the gene for any protein receptor and transfer it to cells in culture, which then produce large quantities of the pure protein. For screening, the protein is incorporated in an assay which tests whether candidate drugs bind to it. For drug design, X-ray crystallography is used to obtain the protein's precise three-dimensional structure which can then be fed into a computer programmed to carry out molecular modelling. Agouron employs 17 X-ray crystallographers who play a central role in the drug design process. They crystallise not only the pure target protein but also the complex formed when the drug binds to it. Their structures are fed back to the computer scientists, who use the detailed information about the binding site to improve the drug further. So the design process involves an iterative cycle between computer modelling and crystallography. How will drug discovery develop in the future? 'Over the next few years, we're going to see more emphasis on experiments taking place within living cells,' predicts Dr John Maynard, research director of Amersham International. 'You can only examine cellular expression systems by looking at living cells.' Sir Richard Sykes believes that it will become technically possible to improve the structure of candidate drugs in situ, while the molecule is actually attached to the target site, through a process of chemical evolution - 'the long-term potential is to put some sort of evolutionary pressure on the discovery process,' he says. 'For example, if you have an enzyme, by an evolutionary technology you would develop the molecule within the active site. I would think this is the way people are thinking: move away from peptides to small organic molecules and alter them within the active site. In effect you're trying to speed up the process of natural evolution.'

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (1): Survival of the fastest - Research used to be an expense which was never questioned, but not any more. The high costs of developing new medicines, tighter regulatory demands - and pressures on national health budgets - mean that only those groups capable of bringing innovative preparations quickly to the market will survive 
text:  The flow of funding for pharmaceuticals research and development - the lifeblood of the drugs industry - is under threat. Drugs companies' ability to raise R&amp;D spending is being undermined by healthcare reforms introduced by cash-strapped governments around the globe. 'I've never seen the like of last year before. It was grim. Nearly every country took one route or another to cut drugs expenditure,' laments Mr Rene Dehecq, president of Elf Sanofi, the French group. Last year prescription drugs sales in the top 10 markets grew only 4 per cent, according to IMS International, the market research group. The sector is unlikely to expand faster this year. The mood of the industry, which has been used to growth of between 17 per cent and 20 per cent a year, has descended into deep depression. 'The climate has changed dramatically from one of expansion to feelings of great introspection, examination and constraint,' explains Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. Admittedly, market growth had already been decelerating before last year but drugs companies had previously responded by cutting manufacturing, marketing and general administrative costs. R&amp;D had remained inviolate. Now, the precipitous rise in pharmaceuticals R&amp;D - from Dollars 5.4bn in 1981 to Dollars 26.5bn last year according to the UK-based Centre for Medicines Research - appears to be ending. The top 10 R&amp;D spenders last year increased their investment by only 11.4 per cent. The deceleration in R&amp;D growth may be inevitable, according to Prof Jurgen Drews, president of international R&amp;D at Roche, the Swiss healthcare group. 'The industry has clearly been over-spending. Global prescription sales would need to reach about Dollars 280bn a year within 10 years to justify the present levels of investment. The chances of reaching that figure are more than low - they are non-existent,' warns Prof Drews. The 10 largest prescription drugs markets - representing more than 90 per cent of the world market - were worth Dollars 114.9bn last year. Dr Rosenberg concludes: 'The worst case scenario would be that the pharmaceuticals industry as we know it disappears because companies no longer believe that there is a likelihood of generating a reasonable return on money put into research. The heady days of R&amp;D are over.' The impact of healthcare reform and the consequent slowing of sales growth on R&amp;D spending can be seen in the table (see page two), compiled by the Financial Times. A few groups, mostly European companies with strong volume growth, have managed to avoid slowing their investment. For example, Sweden's Astra, and three British companies - Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - increased their spending by more than 20 per cent last year. Most companies registered only single-digit R&amp;D growth, and a few - for the first time in recent memory - actually cut R&amp;D spending last year. Among the top 40-odd pharmaceuticals groups, five companies - three in the US, one in Europe and one in Japan - were forced to reduce expenditure in not only real, but also nominal, terms. Mr Lodewijk de Vink, president and chief operating officer at Warner-Lambert, whose drugs subsidiary Parke Davis cut its budget, explains: 'R&amp;D used to be a cost-centre that was never questioned. But the days of macho spending are over. Current levels of spending are clearly unsustainable and there will be more companies out there cutting R&amp;D. More is not necessarily better.' The dangers of cutting research and development are considerable, however. For some groups it could prove terminal. 'Once a company starts cutting R&amp;D, then it's over. It's the lifeblood of a pharmaceuticals company,' warns Dr Edward Scolnick, president of Merck Research Laboratories, the US's biggest drugs group. Mr Bill Steere, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer of the US and chairman of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, explains: 'Those companies without anything in their pipeline and with slowing sales are going to find it increasingly difficult to justify funding R&amp;D aggressively. 'They're going to get more and more frightened as their income recedes and that will set up some kind of synergistic death spiral as they cut R&amp;D because their income is dropping. They'll be killing themselves.' The irony is that at the same time as R&amp;D spending growth is decelerating, the scientific opportunities for creating innovative new medicines are expanding rapidly. Biotechnology and a greater understanding of the life and death of the cell are opening up vast new scientific and medical horizons, according to Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group. 'The basic biology of cellular mechanisms is becoming more and more understood. Drug design is becoming more of a science than an art,' he says. Dr William Scott, senior vice-president of exploratory drug discovery research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, explains: 'The opportunities for making better drugs are greater than ever before. In a short period of time, most genes in the human body will be sequenced. Once we can identify the molecular basis of diseases, then we can begin to treat them.' The problem of how to access such new technologies is exercising the minds of all research directors. Many are clearly irked by the view propagated by small biotechnology pharmaceuticals groups are being left behind. Although a few groups such as Roche and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer have acquired biotechnology companies, others have limited themselves to small joint-ventures, adopting a portfolio approach. The difficulty for the pharmaceuticals companies is creating the in-house expertise capable of judging which projects to pick. Dr Hiroyki Nagasako, board director for corporate planning at Daiichi, the Japanese group, explains why his company has no plans to link up with biotechnology companies: 'There are exciting things happening in the US biotechnology industry but frankly you need to develop proper levels of expertise to manage these technologies and unfortunately we do not have these skills. It's an expensive business and you can waste a lot of money.' Given the increasingly difficult environment for pharmaceuticals companies, only those capable of discovering and rapidly developing innovative drugs on a global basis will survive. Dr John McCall, executive director of discovery research at Upjohn in the US, says: 'The right response to the new environment is clearly to develop novel compounds. They're more fun to work with, easier to register with the regulatory authorities and more profitable. There will be no place for me-too, copy-cat, drugs in the future.' Targeting innovative drugs is a high-risk, high reward strategy. 'Development is going to be riskier,' says Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president of clinical research at Schering-Plough research institute in the US. 'There will be companies capable of discovering innovative profitable compounds that allow them to fund further research, and then there are others who are just going to go down the tubes.' Meanwhile, given the deteriorating operating environment, company boards are now insisting that money spent on R&amp;D is invested increasingly productively. Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's director of research, development and medical UK, admits: 'Until recently the pressure to look very hard at what we ought to do has simply not been there.' Almost all R&amp;D directors are focusing their efforts, cutting the number of therapeutic areas they explore. They are also concentrating their resources, taking fewer but more innovative compounds from the laboratory into clinical trials. They aim to develop drugs as quickly as possible in the three main markets, the US, Japan and Europe so that the huge costs of developing the medicines can be recouped. The regulatory environment is not conducive to rapid development, however. Regulatory authorities now require more than simple data proving a drug is safe and effective. They are already demanding further data to demonstrate a new compound is better than existing therapies. In addition, pharmaceuticals companies are also being drawn into the statistical and methodological quagmire of health economics as the authorities demand data proving a medicine is cost-effective. Both trends add time to the cost and duration of a drug's development. Given the increasing cost of drug development and the need to focus resources, a number of pharmaceuticals companies have reacted by forging alliances in particular therapeutic categories. 'We need to collaborate more, not compete in basic research,' explains Mr Robert Cawthorn, chief executive of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. However, greater scientific collaboration, cost-cutting, and better use of existing resources can only go so far. 'It's going to be a lot smaller industry. There's going to be a lot of consolidation,' says Mr Steere at Pfizer. Second tier companies will need to allocate their resources carefully, employ considerable skill and enjoy a great deal of luck if they are to develop the next generation of products capable of ensuring their survival in this ever-harshening healthcare environment. The stakes involved in playing molecular roulette are higher than ever before. Few of those that fail to develop innovative drugs will be independent by the end of the decade.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------            Pharmaceutical research and development, 1992-93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        R&amp;D, 1992   R&amp;D, 1993  Increase  Sales,  % R&amp;D/                      in dollarsm in dollarsm   %, 1993    1993   sales  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / British Rail franchise sell-off to be delayed by up to a year 
text:  The privatisation of British Rail is to be delayed by up to a year as government and rail authorities work through the detailed preparations needed to begin the sale of franchises. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, disclosed yesterday that the government did not expect to sell off the first six franchises until some time before the end of 1995. It had originally hoped to sell the franchise for the Gatwick Express, running between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport, this autumn and a further six franchises early next year. 'We did indicate an earlier timetable when the Railways Bill was going through the House but that was before we had done detailed work,' Mr MacGregor said. News of the delay came less than two weeks before the creation of separate companies to own BR's track and signalling and to lease rolling stock. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, said: 'The Tories' plans for rail privatisation are falling apart before they've even started.' Despite the delay, the government still hopes to have privatised more than half of BR's passenger rail services by April 1996. The first six franchises to be sold off are expected to be Gatwick Express; the east coast main line between London and Scotland; the Great Western main line; the London, Tilbury and Southend line; south-western division; and ScotRail. The Isle of Wight line will be sold off later because it will operate as a single unit including both train operations and track. Apart from Gatwick Express, which is already operating as an independent company within BR, the first six franchises will start operating as 'shadow franchises' from April 1 this year with the remaining 19 due to start in October. These will be run by their existing management as independent operations to establish how attractive they might be for private bidders. A fear of some potential bidders is that the government might reduce or remove subsidies for lossmaking lines during the life of a franchise. Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, indicated that the Treasury would be expected to maintain subsidies. The privatisation timetable announcement coincided with the launch of a campaign against the rail programme by Save our Railways, a protest group, the Labour party and the three transport unions.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 3,200 mark challenged in nervous trade - Market report 
text:  A highly-charged session saw the UK stock market struggle to hold on to the 3,200 mark on the FT-SE Index as it closed just ahead of the US Federal Reserve's decision to signal a modest rise in short-term interest rates. In mid-afternoon, the London stock market plunged sharply to a new trading low for the year of 3,186.9 in the face of a sell-off in stock index futures. The market was dominated throughout the day by the prospects for the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). London closed a few minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve's actions in the US money markets, and UK analysts were left to ponder the implications overnight. The session opened strongly, with UK government bonds leading equities ahead and interest rate confidence heartened in Europe by the Bundesbank announcement of another variable rate money market repos tender today. UK company news also continued to help sentiment, as Prudential, the UK life and general insurance group, joined the list of leading British companies to increase its dividend payment; but the Prudential share price became a casualty of the market setback later in the day. Although trading volume was unimpressive at this stage, the Footsie climbed by more than 22 points and the market appeared confident in spite of the uncertainty ahead of the FOMC meeting. But the stock market was halted in its tracks and then driven sharply downwards when the June futures contract on the Footsie ran into trouble. Although selling of the contract, still in its early days, was not heavy, the price quickly fell through the 3,200 mark and took the underlying stock market with it. Traders suspected that futures selling came from securities houses suddenly nervous ahead of the FOMC meeting. The stock market fell into important support territory before rallying, once again taking its lead from the stock index futures sector. Concern was expressed at the evident power of derivatives markets to influence the underlying stock market. In part, this reflected the lack of volume and nervousness in equities while bond markets remain so fickle. The FT-SE Index struggled back into positive territory to close at 3,201.5, a net gain of 3.5 on the day. London traders were then left on the sidelines to watch the response of the US credit markets to the Federal Reserve's actions which, it was then clear, were likely to lead to an early tightening in credit policies in the US. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the market trend, ending the day with a loss of 1.4 at 3,853.1. Seaq volume picked up in the second half of the session to record a total of 678m shares, a third higher than on Monday, when retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.19bn. The retail number, the most significant guide to genuine investment activity in the stock market, was at the lower end of daily averages for the past twelve months. While some Far Eastern stocks rebounded strongly behind the 4 per cent upturn in the Hong Kong market, the rest of the UK market was unable to escape from the shadow cast ahead of the FOMC meeting. The erratic performance from bond markets over the past week has underlined the dependence of equities on the interest rate drama currently being acted out in Europe and the US.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading 
text:  A squeeze in stock index futures at the close of trading enlivened what had been an erratic session in derivatives. The late rally in futures fuelled strong buying of the underling FT-SE 100 Index ahead of the close of the stock market, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,211, which was about 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 10 points, with the strong finish attributed to a late advance in UK gilts. Volume at the official close was 10,275 lots. Bonds had also been firmer earlier in the day when June opened at 3,208, and good buying drove the contract to the day's peak of 3,229. However, a bout of nervous trading ahead of the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting saw June surrender early gains and it fell to a low of 3,183 in the early afternoon. In Liffe FT-SE Mid-250, June traded 97 contracts and it closed at 3,850. The screen showed no turnover in the same contract on the OMLX. In Liffe traded options, turnover improved to 43,697 contracts ahead of today's expiry of the March stock options. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 17,973 lots and 2,594 in the Euro FT-SE option. Bid speculation made Argyll Group the busiest stock option with a total of 4,530 lots.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Prudential concerns 
text:  Prudential, the UK's biggest general insurer was the market's second heaviest-traded stock with more than 12m shares changing hands after better than expected preliminary results. Prudential shares touched 343p immediately the figures were published but subsequently closed 2 1/2 off at 331 1/2 p. Mr Trevor May, insurance analyst at BZW, increased his current year forecast for Prudential from Pounds 565m to Pounds 650 after the results, but said sentiment in the market remained affected by worries about pension transfers. Marketmakers said Prudential shares were still affected by the sale early last month of a near 2.5 per cent stake in the company, some 46m shares, at 350p a share. Food retailer Argyll saw huge options turnover - 4,530 contracts, equivalent to 4.5m shares - encouraging speculation that a bid may be in the offing. KKR, the US leveraged buy-out specialist, was one name being rumoured as taking a keen interest in the UK group, whose shares have been strong performers recently. Argyll shares retreated 3 to 256p in a generally weak food retail sector as investors were reminded of the industry's problems following results from Iceland. Continuing margin pressure and sales growth decline were worse than the market had been expecting and the shares retreated 4 to 153p. Turnover in aero-engines group Rolls-Royce rose to 16.2m, with buyers encouraged by an upbeat presentation to institutions on Monday. Hoare Govett, the group's broker, was said to have had a big buyer, and US investment bank Lehman Brothers was also reported to have been a keen purchaser early in the session. The shares, up initially closed 2 1/2 off at 189 1/2 p. Stocks with a substantial exposure to Hong Kong responded to the big rally on that market overnight, with HSBC jumping 23 to 783p. There was an element of unease surrounding NatWest's acquisition of Citizens First, the US bank, for Dollars 500m. NatWest shares slipped 8 to 464p on heavy turnover of 10m shares. Sun Alliance slipped 4 to 325p ahead of tomorrow's preliminary results which are expected to reveal profits recovering strongly to around the Pounds 175m-Pounds 190m mark, against last year's Pounds 129m loss. Water stocks were the best performers in a generally strong utilities sector following a buy recommendation from BZW. The broker's utilities team was said to have pinpointed dividend potential in the sector, and highlighted the attractions of Anglian, 510p, North West, 543p and Severn Trent, 572p, all of which rose 8 on the day. The power generators also moved ahead strongly, with PowerGen driven by a Kleinwort Benson buy note. The shares put on 5 to 565p. Oil shares responded to the latest rise in crude oil prices, to above the Dollars 14 a barrel level ahead of Friday's Opec meeting in Geneva. Marketmakers were said to have moved quickly to fill in their short trading position in the various stocks, driving BP up 6 1/2 to 377 1/2. Clyde Petroleum slipped 2 1/2 to 34p following results described as disappointing by some analysts. However, Hoare Govett, Clyde's broker, said the shares were 'obviously oversold compared with their peers.' Lasmo dipped late to close 3 off at 128p with the market braced for a possible cut in the dividend and big underlying losses. News that metals group Johnson Matthey had signed a collaboration deal with Canada's Ballard Power Systems boosted the stock and the shares put on 8 to 590p. Weak bond markets continued to undermine property stocks, with Panmure Gordon taking a more cautious view on the sector. Land Securities fell 6 to 680p, MEPC 6 to 478p and Slough Estates 10 to 252p. Packaging group RPC was heavily traded after agency broker Charterhouse Tilney crossed just over 4m shares, equivalent to 6 per cent of the company. Dealers said the trade was priced at 162p and the shares closed 3 lower at that level. Trinity International the newspaper and packaging group, improved 3 to 458p on increased profits. SG Warburg raised its 1994 forecast by Pounds 0.5m to Pounds 23m. Unilever was said to have benefited from switch advice out of the NV shares from NatWest Securities.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bowater tumbles 
text:  Paper and packaging company Bowater was the big casualty in the Footsie as consideration of annual figures prompted concern over profitability. The shares fell 39 to 453p, a slide of around 8 per cent, with 7.8m traded. Despite increased profits, reduced gearing and an increased dividend, underlying profits were flat once gains from currency shifts and acquisitions had been stripped out. There were also worries that Bowater would not be able to pass on the rise in paper prices to its customers, and concern over the short-term future for the company was highlighted by a change of stance from SG Warburg which has been recommending the shares for the past five years. The house is believed to be worried that consolidation among Bowater's customers means that contracts are bigger but rarer and much more competitive. There also concerns that Bowater is about to return to the acquisition trail. However, Ms Chris Munro at house broker Hoare Govett said: 'Bowater has positioned itself very well for long term growth.'

text:  Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo, which has one of the highest market capitalisations of UK quoted companies, fell sharply yesterday as a fresh challenge was launched at its top selling product. Geneva Pharmaceutical, an arm of Ciba-Geigy, one of the leading global drugs groups, has filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a new rival for Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which makes up around 43 per cent of Glaxo's sales. It claims the product would not infringe Glaxo's patent which expires in 2002. Bearish analysts, particularly those from US houses, said the news was a severe blow partly because it constituted a completely new challenge to Zantac and partly because of the status of the challenger. Ms Jo Walton of Lehman Brothers said 'The result is further uncertainty making it very difficult for investors to be clear how long the Zantac franchise will remain.' A Glaxo spokesman said the company was considering legal action against the Geneva application. Very heavy selling after the news broke sent the shares down 21 to 662p on turnover of 11m, and busy trade in options. Ciba shares were up SFr40 at SFr855.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Stocks react calmly to FOMC rise in rate 
text:  Wall Street US stocks reacted with relative calm yesterday to a signal by the Federal Reserve that it had decided to nudge up short-term interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.30 lower to 3,862.55, after jumping about seven points on the Fed's announcement that its policy-making committee had voted to add reserves to the banking system. Analysts said the statement was an indication that the central bank was lifting its target for the federal funds rate for the second time in two months. Other important market indices also showed little change on the day, defying forecasts of a sharp downturn on the news of a rate increase. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.26 better at 468.80, while the American SE composite inched 0.96 ahead to 471.73. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.95 to 796.35. NYSE volume, at 282m shares, was moderate. Advancing issues led declines, 1,015 to 929. Investors were tentative as the market opened, as attention was fixed on a policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Most analysts were expecting the members of FOMC to vote for a further tightening. But the morning brought no indication of a shift to tighter money, and blue-chip stocks, in parallel with bonds, moved moderately higher in early trading. The Fed's announcement finally came during the mid-afternoon and the reaction was immediate. In the bond market, prices across the yield curve jumped amid relief that the long-anticipated Fed action had finally come to pass. Stocks also improved, but the upturn was more modest and short-lived. By the close, the Dow industrials were barely changed on the day. Among individual issues, Alcoa added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 78 3/8 and Disney was up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 , but Philip Morris lost Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 52 1/8 on news of a congressional recommendation to raise federal taxes on cigarettes. In pharmaceuticals, Merck dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 30 1/2 on reports that its cholesterol-reducing drug would soon face competition from a cheaper product from Sandoz. Bristol-Myers Squibb, down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 53 1/8 , was also hit hard by the news. On the Nasdaq, investors showed a lack of confidence in Novell's decision to mount a challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the market for personal computer software. The stock slumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 20. Mexico Mexican stock prices rallied sharply after Mr Manuel Camacho Solis announced he would not run for the president, putting to rest speculation that has rattled the bolsa in recent weeks. The key IPC index of 36 leading shares gained 128.91 points or 5.41 per cent to end at 2,511.92. It was the biggest one-day percentage rise since January 1991. Canada Toronto stocks closed higher in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index was up 28.38 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 4,551.88, with advances edging declines 424 to 423. Volume rose to 67.28m shares from 62.36 shares. Trading value was CDollars 706.8m.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mark time awaiting US news 
text:  European equity markets marked time yesterday in advance of the decision by the US Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to raise the federal funds rate by from 3.25 to 3.50 per cent, as they watched for clues from Washington. Before the close of trading on European bourses the only guidance available was that the committee was still reviewing economic conditions and had not yet discussed the direction it wanted to set for interest rates over the coming eight-week period. FRANKFURT consolidated its position with a day's gain in the Dax index of 10.06 to 2,141.34, but off from the session high of 2,155.31. Traders said that a weakening in the futures market contributed to the easing. Turnover was modest at DM7.6bn. The banking sector attracted attention with further results due out in the next couple of weeks. James Capel, in a research note issued on Monday, noted that its forecasts for 1994-95 had been shaded down for two main reasons. It said: 'We have probably been too optimistic for the pace of recovery in terms of lending growth and falling bad debts.' The note added: 'This years trading profits have been adversely affected by the markets' reaction to the trend reversal in US interest rates'. Bayerishe Hypo, which pleased the market with results yesterday, added DM1.50 to DM469, while Bayerishe Vereinsbank, results due later this week, gained DM2 to DM491. Volkswagen, up DM3.50 at DM490.50, strengthened on hopes of good 1993 figures due tomorrow. ZURICH finished higher as domestic institutional buyers returned at current lower prices but the day's best levels were not maintained. The SMI index rose 20.4 to 2,824.7, after a high of 2,843.3. Ciba registered rose SFr40 to SFr855: the company has filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a rival to Glaxo's Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Nestle, with results due this week put on SFr21 to SFr1,241. Sandoz, with results scheduled for tomorrow, rose SFr50 to SFr3,920 amid suggestions that the introduction of its Lescol cholesterol drug could spark a price war in the US. Georg Fischer rose SFr50 to SFr1,310: the mechanical engineering group said it expected to break even in this year after a 1993 loss of SFr34m. Holderbank rose SFr3 to SFr963 in response to its 12.3 per cent rise in 1993 net profit. PARIS fell back from its session high in a volatile session, the CAC-40 index finally closing down 2.01 at 2,200.68. The index moved between a high of 2,222.52 and a low of 2,196.12. BNP, which the government said would have its stake in UAP cut from 19 per cent to 15 per cent as part of the insurers privatisation, lost FFr2.70 to FFr251.80. UAP was unchanged at FFr189.90. AMSTERDAM drifted down, with the AEX index losing 1.91 to 414.33. Pakhoed, the storage and transport group, which repeated its forecast that 1994 earnings per share were set to rise, lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 53.80. In a separate development PTT, the Dutch post and telephone utility, announced that its first tranche of shares could be floated on June 7. MILAN was steady, helped by the positive early tone in other European markets and having found technical support at Monday's lower levels. The Comit index edged 0.34 lower to 664.68 as election uncertainties remained at the centre of attention. Industrials led the way. Fiat rose L61 to L4,999, Pirelli L58 to L2,431 and Montedison L43 to L1,238. Olivetti put on L65 to L2,593 as hopes remained high for a swift decision on Italy's second mobile telephone licence. ISTANBUL fell 4.8 per cent, wiping out Monday's gains, in uncertain trade ahead of Monday's local elections. The composite index lost 747.76 to 14,838. The elections are viewed as a key test of whether Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's coalition government can be trusted to tackle the looming economic crisis. Analysts agree that the election will be followed by sharp price rises as the government relaxes restraints on loss making state run companies, but observers are divided on what effect the polls will have on financial markets, hit by a plunging lira and soaring interest rates.

text:  A sharp sell off in the bond market prompted by concerns over rising tensions in the Korean peninsula and higher US interest rates affected investor confidence, and the Nikkei index closed lower amid low volumes, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average declined 215.92, or 1.1 per cent, to 20,253.53 after a high of 20,458.55 and a low of 20,202.42. Falls in the futures market prompted arbitrage selling, while small lot profit-taking also depressed share prices. Volume was 360m shares as investors refrained from activity ahead of last trading day for March settlements on Friday. Buying by foreign investors also declined from previous weeks. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 19.23 to 1,628.01 while the Nikkei 300 declined 3.42 to 299.27. Losers led gainers by 826 to 247, with 111 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.67 to 1,344.28. North Korea's rejection of full international inspection of its nuclear facilities and the subsequent decisions by the US to deploy missiles in Seoul fueled fears of growing tensions in the Korean peninsula. Such uncertainty coupled with speculation of a further rise in US interest rates hurt the bond market, which in turn dampened the share prices. Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said that Japanese institutions may choose to invest in the bond market if long term interest rates rise further. He expects volatility on the bond market to affect share prices on the short term and sees the Nikkei index closing this business year between 19,500 and 20,000. Interest rate sensitive shares lost ground in anticipation of higher long term interest rates. Nippon Steel fell Y4 to Y350 and Tokyo Electric Power by Y80 to Y3,290. Banks were lower on profit-taking with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y100 to Y3,210 and Sumitomo Bank off Y30 to Y2,170. Bakery and flour mill stocks were once again sought by speculators due to the continued rice shortage. Retailers are reporting a rise in sales of bread and noodles and Yamazaki Baking rose Y30 to Y2,100 and Nitto Flour Milling gained Y20 to Y550. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 196.17 to 22,349.87 in volume of 92.2m shares. Aoki International, a retailer of office workers' uniform blue suits, plunged Y240 to Y3,300. Roundup Regional markets adopted sharply divergent routes. HONG KONG rebounded, the Hang Seng index gaining 4 per cent to finish above 9,000 as bargain hunters sent prices up after the recent losses, and with a rise in US rates already discounted. The index jumped 345.14 to end a volatile day at 9,012.17, having swung from a low of 8,533 to a high of 9,150 as Japanese funds were seen returning as buyers. Preliminary turnover was a healthy HKDollars 6.34bn against Monday's HKDollars 6.52bn. The turnaround came as Mr Stuart Cook of Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities said that the Hang Seng was unlikely to hit its January 4 high of 12,599 again this year, but it could rebound to 10,000-12,000 by the end of the year. He said that the market was still attractive with strong corporate earnings anticipated. Interest rates would remain low, and it was unlikely that property prices would crash in the next 12 months. However, Morgan Stanley has reiterated its view that the index could touch or pass the 7,000 level as a result of bloated property prices, the Deng succession and MFN status for China. 'At the 7,000 level we would recommend buying stocks heavily. The long term story on China is still intact and as attractive as ever.' KUALA LUMPUR picked up 1.4 per cent after recent sell-offs as bargain hunting lifted the composite index 13.30 to 967.48. The index hit a low of 936.80 in early trade after falling 92.30 points over the previous three trading days. SINGAPORE was firmer in a technical rebound after Monday's sharp falls and the Straits Times Industrials index rose 8.74 to 2,045.04 after hitting an intra-day low of 1,990.37. AUSTRALIA saw late bargain hunting pick shares up from their lows, leaving the All Ordinaries index to finish 0.3 firmer at 2,140.8, having been 14.7 points down at one stage. SEOUL closed easier in weak trading as mild selective buying centred on some blue chips was wiped out by selling pressure caused by growing tension over North Korea's nuclear row. The composite index eased 7.70 to 877.95. NEW ZEALAND was unnerved by weakness elsewhere and the NZSE-40 capital index fell 48.41 or 2.2 per cent to 2,206.93 in moderate turnover of NZDollars 44m. MANILA recouped some of its sharp early losses after Hong Kong's rebound and the composite index finished 34.97 or 1.3 lower at 2,563.60, after a low of 2,503. BOMBAY was lower in nervous trade triggered by the Bombay Stock Exchange declaring a local stock broker defaulter. The BSE 30-share index closed 28.95 lower at 3,791.78. COLOMBO was lower again prompting speculation that the correction which began on March 1 would continue at least until after tomorrow's southern provincial council election. The all-share index fell 10.01 to 1,256.48.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Swedish bull run may be coming to an end - Emphasis will be on corporate earnings in 1994 
text:  A bull run dating from late 1992 may finally be coming to an end for Swedish equities. Long-term interest rates are heading upwards, thanks to turbulence in international markets and worries about higher US interest rates, At the same time a stream of rights issues is soaking up liquidity. The two trends have combined to bring the most unsettled market conditions for nearly 18 months. Shares have generally fallen in recent days, but even so the Affarsvarlden index remains up some 4 per cent since the beginning of the year. The turbulence may just be temporary: Goldman Sachs in London, for example, anticipates a 20 per cent rise in the market over the next 12 months. To some extent, the bourse has been a victim of its own success. What began as a trickle of companies seeking new equity from their shareholders has turned into a flood. The government is also making heavy demands on the market with its privatisation programme, the most recent being its SKr8bn (Dollars 1bn) sell-off of a 49 per cent stake in forestry group AssiDoman. Some observers are suggesting that the state's planned late spring disposal of its stake in Pharmacia - for an estimated SKr14bn-16bn - should be delayed. Skandia, the insurance group, and Avesta Sheffield, the stainless steel producer, are the latest big companies to announce rights issues. According to one estimate, rights issues and privatisations may soak up as much as SKr50bn this year, equal to some 3.4 per cent of GDP, and dwarfing the SKr27bn raised in 1993. The demand is huge, but supply from both foreign and domestic sources remains healthy. Last year foreigners bought a net SKr30.8bn of Swedish shares, taking their ownership of the stock market to nearly 25 per cent. There has been no sign of a let up in 1994, with a further SKr3.95bn of net purchases by foreigners in January. Mr Bjorn Karlin, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Share Promotion, expects overseas institutions to make SKr30bn of net purchases in 1994 simply because many are still adjusting their portfolio weightings after Sweden relaxed restrictions on foreign share ownership in January 1993. He also expects a big inflow of funds from domestic institutions and households because of higher personal savings, new individual pension schemes, and changed tax treatment for dividends and capital gains. Most analysts are agreed that the fundamentals will remain strong in 1994. However, the driving factor this year will be corporate earnings, rather than lower interest rates, even though the trend for the latter is expected to be downward. Corporate results for 1993 generally met or exceeded expectations, and further gains are anticipated this year as companies benefit from the three hard years of cost-cutting and a generally weak currency. One big difference in 1994 is that currency flows have been hedged at much more attractive rates. The general economic picture is also much more encouraging, with positive GDP growth expected in 1994 for the first year since 1990. The recovery was triggered by strong growth in exports, following a 20 per cent depreciation in the krona last year, but is now spreading to the domestic economy. The improved economic outlook has brought a strengthening of the krona since the beginning of the year. This will be positive for foreign interest in the market, according to Mr Christian Diebitsch, Swedish analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London. 'I don't think we will see the market rise another 54 per cent rise in local currencies, like last year, but a strong krona is certainly positive from a foreign perspective,' he states. On the negative side, Sweden's huge budget deficit - one of the highest in the OECD - and an unemployment rate of around 14 per cent will continue to cause concern about the state of the country's finances. Uncertainty will also increase as the year progresses, with both a general election and a referendum on entry into the European Union due before the end of the year. A 'no' vote in the EU referendum, in particular, would damage confidence. These factors aside, there is the market's vulnerability to developments in the international arena: a vulnerability which has been enhanced by the increased levels of foreign ownership.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Fed lifts interest rates 
text:  The US Federal Reserve yesterday confirmed US interest rates are on a gradual upward path when it tightened monetary policy for the second time in two months, writes Philip Gawith. The Fed did not specify the extent of the move, but it was taken for granted in the market that the announcement involves a 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate, to 3.50 per cent. This follows a similar rise to 3.25 per cent on February 4th. The tightening had been largely discounted in the market and there was little reaction. The dollar rose just over half a pfennig to trade at DM1.6870 from DM1.68 before the announcement. It was little changed against the yen hovering at the Y106 level. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman, said the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had decided to increase pressure on bank reserves in order to raise interest rates. 'This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates,' said Mr Greenspan. The announcement was made after the FOMC meeting at 19h20 GMT. Attention will now switch to the Bundesbank which is today expected to announce a further cut in its repo rate. The combination of a rise in US rates and a lowering of German rates could well give the dollar a significant upward lift. In the UK, meanwhile, the release of the February retail price index is keenly awaited. Some observers believe a good number could trigger a cut in interest rates, but this is a minority view. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Fed's action 'confirms that Greenspan is still in a gradualist mode. The strong implication is that it is a 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, not an increase in the (more significant) discount rate.' Mr Hannah said the nature of the Fed's move also 'adds a degree of predictability about the timing of Fed interest rate moves. This could help the markets to settle down a bit.' The February 4th tightening - the first increase in US rates in five years - sent financial markets into turmoil with bond yields rising sharply in all western countries. For the second time in a row the central bank acted after an FOMC meeting, in the process also showing that it was not responding to specific economic data. The IBJ analyst described the Fed's move as 'not so much tightening as normalising on a gradualist path.' Mr Greenspan made clear in February that he felt real interest rates had fallen to abnormally low levels. The timing of the move caught the market slightly off-guard. Earlier in the day the Fed had, in its normal open market operations, added reserves with two-day system repos which suggested no change in monetary policy. This led many to believe that the Fed would not act until today. The dollar continues to be wrapped in bearish sentiment. With last night's Fed tightening already in the market, one view was that the fate of the dollar was more in the hands of the Bundesbank than the Fed. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), commented: 'What really matters is if the Fed can tighten in tandem with a Bundesbank move. That is the only thing that will lend significance to a 25 basis point Fed tightening.' Ahead of the Fed announcement, the D-Mark was firmer across the board in Europe. It closed at FFr3.418 from FFr3.407 on Monday against the French franc. Analysts warned that if the Bundesbank did not quicken the pace of monetary easing, the steady weakening over the past week of the franc could continue. The Bundesbank announced it was holding another variable rate repo. The lowest bid accepted last week was 5.88 per cent, a reduction of six basis points in the repo rate. Analysts are predicting a fall of up to ten basis points. Overnight rates firmed slightly, from 5.70/5.80 per cent to 5.80/5.90 ahead of the repo, but analysts doubted whether this would have any adverse effect. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, noted that the mid-point of the overnight rate was still below the repo rate and this normally favoured a larger drop in the repo rate. 'Banks tend to be quite ambitious on the bidding,' she said. Last week the overnight rate fell to the repo rate level only at the time of the auction. Sterling finished more than a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.5094 from DM2.5205. Traders said the UK currency was being affected by speculation about an interest rate cut. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan, warned there was a danger of a rate cut backfiring. If it upsets the gilts market, this will put upward pressure on mortgage rates. In the discount market the Bank of England dispatched a shortage of Pounds 750m without difficulty. Sterling futures firmed slightly with the June contract a basis point up at 94.85.

The yellow metal ended at Dollars 389.25 a troy ounce, while SILVER was up 16 cents at Dollars 5.57 1/2 an ounce.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels' cheese-paring irritates Italians - John Simkins reports on resistance to a proposal to reduce the country's milk quota 
text:  Italy's milk producers are strongly resisting a proposal by the European Commission to reduce an increase in their quota just as they believe they are getting back on track after years of over-production. Their anger is directed at Mr Rene Steichen, the agriculture commissioner, who has decided that an agreed increase of 900,000 tonnes in Italy's annual milk quota, taking it to a total of 9.9m tonnes, should be reduced by 350,000 tonnes in 1994-95. A hot reception awaited Mr Steichen earlier this month when he was to attend the opening of Italy's agricultural trade fair in Verona, but the commissioner had second thoughts and stayed away. In response, Italy's three big farming associations also boycotted the event. However, the producers are likely to confront him at Brussels on March 28 and 29 when the European Union's agriculture ministers will discuss the Italian quota. Italy, which is a net importer of milk, admits to having violated milk quotas for much of the 1980s and Denmark, Britain and the Netherlands were reluctant to see its quota increased. But the 9.9m tonne quota was granted in the light of Italian commitments to bring production down from an estimated 11.5m to 9.9m by the end of March 1995. As a first stage, Italy was expected to reduce production to 10.6m by the end of this month. The commission believes Italy is not meeting the demands made of it. Whereas Spain and Greece have had quota increases confirmed - the latter only provisionally - it has therefore shaved Italy's. The decision will make it easier for the commission to win the approval of the 12 EU countries for a suggested 1 per cent cut in quotas in 1994-95. 'The market is fragile and balance is maintained by quotas on the one hand and subsidising outlets on the other,' according to a spokesman for the agriculture commissioner. 'There is no guarantee the balance will continue and there is a serious danger of intervention stocks building up without the cut in quota.' Mr Alfredo Diana, Italy's agriculture minister, retorts that Mr Steichen has acted too hastily and that Italy had until the end of this month to present evidence of the results of a costly overhaul by the ministry, which has subjected 130,000 milk producers to quota controls. The Italians hope that this data will enable Mr Steichen to amend his proposal and he is in close touch with Mr Diana. However, if the cut is confirmed, Italy may face more financial penalties on top of the L2,800bn (Pounds 1.12bn) that Confagricoltura, the farming association, estimates it must pay for violating past quotas. The herd-by-herd examination revealed widespread abuses, such as quotas being claimed by defunct businesses, which disqualified 35,000 farms. The commission claims that at one time quotas were issued for over 12m tonnes, compared with production estimated by the Italians at 11.5m, and Confagricoltura admits that the abuses date back to a period when Italy 'paid too little attention to quotas'. Mr Steichen has complimented Mr Diana on the progress made but it is only in the past 18 months that Italy has signalled a serious attempt to get output in line with quotas. Italy has always objected to the system, mainly because it imports 60 per cent of its annual 18m tonne consumption and has not wished to curb development of its domestic producers. Production is concentrated in the north and transport costs make fresh milk expensive in much of the south. 'It seems nonsense to cut 350,000 tonnes of quotas from a country that imports,' says Mr Walter Luchetti, a director general at the agriculture ministry. Mr Luchetti rejects suggestions that Mr Diana's efforts to reduce production have met with resistance within Italy's fragmented milk industry. 'Our producers have accepted the regulations and are making great efforts to comply,' he says. Confagricoltura says that much of Italy's milk is used to make cheese, which is not in surplus in the EU, and is sceptical about the effectiveness of quotas as a method of balancing the market. 'But we are serious about resolving the milk issue because this is essential to give us negotiating influence in other agriculture reforms,' says the association.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price reaches Dollars 14 ahead of Opec meeting 
text:  Oil prices edged upwards yesterday in advance of the meeting in Geneva on Friday of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for May was hovering just above the Dollars 14 a barrel level in late London trading yesterday. That compares with a closing price of Dollars 13.77 on Monday. Part of the price increase was attributed to storms in the North Sea, which prevented tankers from loading at Norway's Statfjord and Gullfaks fields. Loading operations at Norway's two onshore terminals, Mongstad and Sture, were also affected by bad weather. Mr Peter Gignoux, a trader at the London office of Smith Barney, said evidence of 'a bit more demand from refiners' was also helping to underpin the market. The firmer price coincided with a growing belief in the markets that Opec oil ministers may choose to roll over the present production quota of 24.52m barrels a day, rather than try to engineer a cut in output to boost prices. 'They are waiting for demand to bring the price up,' according to Mr Joseph Stanislaw at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. He said that an extension of the quota for at least the next two quarters could be portrayed in a 'constructive and positive' light. 'The longer they say this is the right quota the better it would be for the markets,' he added. Unlike previous Opec meetings there has been little public evidence of pre-meeting consultations between member states. Nevertheless analysts say the roll-over may emerge as the preferred option because a small cut in quotas of, say, 500,000 b/d would be unlikely to have a lasting impact on prices and would simply give away market share to independent producers. A larger cut of 1m-1.5m b/d could provoke a sharp rise in prices, but it would also raise doubts whether some Opec producers would abide by it.

text:  World commodity prices are forecast to rise by 6 per cent in 1994-95, regaining with interest the estimated overall fall of 2 per cent seen in 1993-94. According to a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, commodity prices overall reached a nadir in the first half of 1993-94, but recovered with a 6 per cent rise in the first quarter of this year and are expected to show a further 1 per cent increase in the second quarter. In the next fiscal year Abare suggests demand will strengthen as more countries move out of recession, and tighter supply conditions persist, particularly for rural products like sugar, cotton and rice. As far as specific commodities are concerned, Abare predicts that the world gold price should rise by about 7 per cent in 1994, to average USDollars 385 an ounce over the year (close to the present level). The forecasters suggest that the price rise will result from increased jewellery fabrication and investment demand, spurred by the general improvement in economic conditions. Abare also sees a firming of the wool prices in 1994-95, as strengthening demand from western Europe and, to a lesser extent, Japan outweighs some upward revisions to expected level of the Australian wool production. It suggests that the market indicator price could increase by about 9 per cent, to average ADollars 5.30 a kilogram clean. However, the average market indicator for 1993-94 is put at around Dollars 4.85, still marginally below the previous year's figure.

Under the terms of the agreement with the China National Petroleum Corporation BP Exploration and four Japanese partners will spend three years on a seismic programme, after which they will have an option to begin exploration drilling. The consortium's commitment is on a relatively small scale, thought to be around Dollars 3m for the seismic operation. Other foreign companies which have recently reached exploration agreements in the area include Exxon and Texaco of the US, Agip of Italy and a number of Japanese companies. The Tarim Basin has long been viewed with interest by foreign companies, but its remote location and lack of infrastructure means development of any oil finds are likely to be long-term prospects.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Underbidders hope for Chilean deal 
text:  Magma Copper of the US and Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company, still hoped to win control of the El Abra project in Chile, one of the world's biggest undeveloped copper deposits, Mr Burgess Winter, the president of Magma, said yesterday. Codelco, the state-owned Chilean copper group, put 51 per cent of El Abra out to tender last year and in October Cyprus Amax of the US with its partner Lac Minerals of Canada, was first past the post offering USDollars 404m and an undertaking to spend Dollars 307m on the project. However, in February, Cyprus and Lac said tests they had made to confirm previous estimates showed reserves at El Abra might be significantly lower than previous data suggested and they might have to renegotiate the deal. Codelco has given them until May 15 to complete. Mr Winter said that, if negotiations between Codelco and Cyprus-Lac broke down, Magma-BHP would press for El Abra to pass to them as the second-highest bidders rather than be put out to tender again. He said Magma-BHP had bid high for El Abra, offering USDollars 240m, some Dollars 10m ahead of RTZ of the UK, third past the post. The gap between the Magma-BHP and Cyprus-Lac bids was explained by the fact that Magma-BHP's test work suggested that El Abra could support annual output of 160,000 tonnes of copper whereas the highest bidders were looking originally for 225,000 tonnes. 'We thought that was impossible,' said Mr Winter. Under the rules Codelco set for the tender, failure to conclude a deal with the highest bidder was to have resulted automatically in the start of negotiations with the underbidder. However, Mr Winter pointed out that Chile's recently-elected new government had changed virtually all of Codelco's senior executives 'so at the moment it is difficult to find someone to talk to'. Some analysts have suggested that the disagreement over El Abra is extremely embarrassing for Codelco as the deal, the first sale of a big ore body by the group, was supposed to set a pattern for other privatisations. It also coincided with revelations that a relatively junior executive had lost USDollars 207m in copper futures trading. Mr Winter, in London to speak to investors, said Magma expected the copper price to reach Dollars 1 a lb by the end of this year against last night's London Metal Exchange three-month price of 88.6 cents.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries jump as Fed nudges rates higher 
text:  US Treasury bond prices jumped yesterday afternoon amid relief that the Federal Reserve had ended weeks of anticipation by signalling a small increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/32 higher at 92 11/32 , with the yield easing by about 10 basis points to 6.853 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  7/32 better at 99 11/32 , to yield 4.948 per cent. The rally, especially at the short end of the yield curve, was surprising. It suggested that the market had already factored a rate increase into bond prices. News of the move came in a mid-afternoon announcement by the Fed that its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase 'slightly' reserves in the banking system. Analysts interpreted the statement as an indication that the FOMC had voted to lift its target for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent. Early on, bond traders were content to remain on the sidelines until the Fed made clear its intentions. Prices across the yield curve were showing moderate improvement in light trading before the announcement. The reaction to the Fed's decision was immediate. Institutional investors poured money into the market, suggesting that yields, after moving markedly higher over the past few weeks, were attractive at current levels. The results of the Treasury's auction of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes suggested as much. The offering, which was awarded at 5.15 per cent only minutes before the Fed's move, drew good demand even though confusion over monetary policy still reigned. European government bond markets pared their gains yesterday afternoon following early indications that the US Fed might leave monetary policy unchanged. Analysts had been surprised by the Fed's lack of action in the morning session, since most traders had expected it to sanction a rise of a quarter-point in the Fed funds rate to 3.5 per cent. The lack of a morning move by the Fed extended the markets' long vigil for evidence that European bonds were in the process of de-coupling from the US market. Analysts said that if the Fed had left monetary policy unchanged, it would have been easier for the Bundesbank to cut its repo rate today. The market had expected the Bundesbank to lower the rate by up to eight basis points from 5.88 per cent. UK gilts generally outperformed other European government bond markets, supported by hopes of favourable inflation data for February due to be released today. The market expects a monthly rise of 0.4 per cent in the retail prices index, bringing the annual rate, excluding mortgages, down to 2.6 per cent from 2.8 per cent in January. Media reports of a Gallup poll showing consumer confidence at a four-year low also supported gilt prices since the findings kept hopes of a further cut in interest rates alive. The June long gilt future on Liffe traded at 109 in the late afternoon, up 17/32 on the day, off the day's high of 109 31/32 but well up on the worst level of 109 5/32 . Analysts expressed disappointment at the size of the Bank of England's first floating-rate gilt for 15 years. They had been confident that the novelty value of the issue would encourage the Bank to set the amount at between Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.5bn. However, the Bank chose to raise only Pounds 2.5bn, indicating to the market that it was comfortable with its funding programme. The other terms of the issue were in line with market expectations - a minimum price of 99.50, a coupon of three-month Libid less  1/8 point and a five-year maturity. German government bond prices see-sawed after news of the Fed's inaction. The June bund future on Liffe stood just under a half-point higher at 96.45 in the late afternoon, below the day's high of 96.60 but off the low of 95.84.

At present, the finance ministry sets limits on total corporate issues for a month. There are similar restrictions on rights issues. In addition, the government will no longer require institutional investors to buy more shares than they sell or make capital contributions to the stock market stabilisation fund. To encourage overseas portfolio investment, the ministry will adopt a 'negative system', in which securities companies will now be able to engage in all foreign exchange dealings except for those prohibited by law. Currently, the ministry has a 'positive system' which bans all offshore portfolio investment unless otherwise permitted by the law.

Credit Agricole-Lazard Financial Products, based in London, will offer a wide range of financial techniques to large international companies. Unlike the financial products subsidiaries set up by CS First Boston and Merrill Lynch, the unit is not designed as a vehicle for trading derivative instruments. An increasing proportion of corporate finance, including mergers and acquisitions business, now involves structured transactions, often using derivative instruments. Mr Edouard Stern, a partner of Lazard Freres, cited Viacom's Dollars 9.5bn agreed takeover of Paramount, which was helped by the offer of contingent value rights, structured using derivatives, to Paramount shareholders. Lazard was Paramount's adviser. In the past, Lazard has used other houses for derivative transactions. Credit Agricole, France's largest bank, is already a significant participant in the debt and derivative markets, but has not been active in corporate finance. Under the partnership, Credit Agricole will provide the necessary capital and trading muscle, while Lazard will provide the client list and corporate finance expertise. The amount of capital provided for the joint company was not disclosed, but 75 per cent is provided by the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole and 25 per cent by the Lazard houses of London, Paris and New York.

Turkey was also placed on CreditWatch suggesting that its rating may be lowered further. S&amp;P cited delays in implementing an austerity plan to tackle Turkey's economic crisis. Earlier this week, the Treasury came close to defaulting on some Dollars 415m-worth of lira-denominated government bonds issued by the state-owned Public Participation Administration. Banks involved say the PPA settled the amount in full, but only after a seven-hour delay. This was too late for many banks to transfer the funds electronically, so they incurred the cost of overnight borrowing to cover their positions. Government finances are facing a growing liquidity shortage. However this is the first time Turkey has appeared close to a default. The crisis came after the Treasury refused to provide finance, forcing the PPA into the interbank markets for an estimated Dollars 200m. This resulted in a scramble for funds pushing up interbank rates, which yesterday touched 450 per cent. The PPA has an estimated Dollars 1bn of outstanding revenue sharing bonds. The two-year bonds are lira-based, dollar-indexed and redeemable at the central bank fixing rate. Bankers say it is moot point whether they are considered foreign or domestic liabilities but the incident renewed bankers' concerns about Turkey's ability to service its foreign debt, which was about Dollars 64bn at end-1993.

text:  Poland plans to borrow over Dollars 1bn on the international capital markets following the successful conclusion of its London Club negotiations for a reduction of up to 45 per cent in its Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt earlier this month. Mr Henryk Chmeliak, the acting finance minister, told an FT conference in Warsaw that the Polish government was exploring the possibility of raising Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn through foreign bonds now that the London Club agreement has re-opened Poland's access to international markets on normal commercial terms. According to Mr Ian Hume, director of the World Bank's Warsaw office, Poland needs higher foreign investment to fund the infrastructure investments needed to underpin sustained rapid growth. But the bulk of Poland's current Dollars 14bn to Dollars 16bn annual investment will continue to be financed domestically, he said, with an increasing proportion coming from domestic bank lending, re-invested profits and other non-bank finance. At the same time, the relative importance of funding by international financial institutions will decline, while foreign direct investment will continue to rise sharply, he added. Meanwhile, the Eurobond market's tense vigil for the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting kept issuers and investors sidelined. Although the Fed's afternoon open-market operation indicated an unchanged policy stance, traders still expect an imminent tightening and predicted that, until it arrives, the primary market will remain deadly quiet. What little demand there is remains focused on floating-rate notes, which are less sensitive to interest rate uncertainty than fixed-rate bonds. This encouraged the Southern Australian Government Finance Authority to issue Dollars 500m of two-year FRNs paying three-month Libor flat, with a par issue price. While some traders said the pricing was on the tight side, an official with lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said the deal met solid demand, benefiting from the recent 'demise of the fixed-rate market' and the recent build-up in cash by money market funds and bond investors looking for short-dated investments. By late afternoon,it was trading around 99.95, he said. Germany's Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank yesterday signed a Euro medium-term note programme worth Dollars 2bn, arranged by Merrill Lynch, and plans to issue an inaugural benchmark Eurobond within the next few weeks, it said. The bank is a central refinancing institution for the German agriculture and food industries, channelling loans through commercial banks. S&amp;P recently assigned a triple-A rating to its long-term debt. It is a frequent borrower in the German domestic market, where it has DM21.5bn of bonds outstanding. Moody's has upgraded to A3 from Baa1 the long-term debt ratings of the Birmingham Midshires Building Society, citing the company's improving profitability and financial fundamentals. Some Pounds 200m of debt is affected. Moody's has also placed the credit ratings of the three UK mortgage-backed securities under review for possible upgrade. They are: Collateralised Mortgage Securities (No 4), rated Aa3; Platform Home Mortgage Securities No 1 plc, rated Aa1; and Stars 1 plc, rated Aa1. Around Pounds 780m in long-term debt is affected.

Favourable natural conditions, tighter cost control and lower interest rates helped the advance. The utility derives nearly all its power production from hydro-generating sites. Total electricity sales were up 5.2 per cent, mainly due to higher industrial demand and higher exports to the US. Total sales revenue rose 3.5 per cent to CDollars 7bn. Operating expenses, fuel, depreciation, amortisation and taxes totalled CDollars 3.76bn, up 3.6 per cent but operating expenses alone rose 1.7 per cent. Taxes plus debt guarantee fees totalled CDollars 650m, up from CDollars 594m in 1992. Financing activities reduced the weighted average interest rate on long-term debt to 9.24 per cent from 9.79 per cent. Exchange losses were down 52 per cent to CDollars 31m. Total investment was CDollars 4bn, slightly lower than 1992. Most of the money went to the new generating capacity in the James Bay area. Hydro-Quebec said its financial ratios remained steady compared with 1992. Its capitalisation ratio was 23.9 per cent, compared with 23.7 per cent in 1992. Being under the minimum 25 per cent threshold, no dividend will be paid.

Last year funds under management more than doubled to Dollars 21.3bn on the back of strongly rising share prices in most Asian markets. Inflows were particularly strong in Hong Kong, where sales of unit trust products reached Dollars 3.7bn. A flood of applications at the beginning of this year forced the company to place a temporary halt on new subscriptions. The company said that it achieved a higher share of agency broking business last year and was active in introducing new products, particularly derivatives and Euro-instruments. It claimed it held first position in the trading of 'B' shares in Shanghai.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Star TV changes tack to attract Asia's middle class 
text:  Star TV, News Corporation's Asian satellite television arm, is to change its business strategy radically in an attempt to broaden its appeal to Asian viewers. Mr Gary Davey, chief executive, said Star would change from being a broadcaster which attempted to lure the top 5 per cent of viewers in Asia to one which attracted the region's growing middle class. Star currently has an estimated 200m viewers in Asia. To achieve this, Mr Davey said Star would change from a predominately English-language broadcaster to one that offered viewers programmes in their own language. He said the change reflected Star's new management taking 'a fresh but realistic look at the market'. Mr Davey, speaking at a media conference in Hong Kong, also foreshadowed the introduction of pay-TV on Star. He said Star was about to launch pay-TV channels, although he did not specify their number or type. Until recently it had been thought that the formidable problems of fee collection across the vast and varied terrain which Star covers would prevent the early introduction of pay-TV. Mr Davey underlined Star TV's appreciation of the special cultural and political circumstances in which it was broadcasting. Star would 'pay greater attention to local needs, tastes and sensitivities,' he said. 'In this region we fully recognise our responsibilities to cater to local needs. In a region with far greater political and cultural diversity than Europe, any broadcaster must be conscious of these sen-sitivities and operate accordingly.' Earlier this week it was announced that the BBC would cease transmitting its World Service Television news on Star TV's 'northern beam'. This covers China, Mongolia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan. Since his move to Hong Kong, Mr Rupert Murdoch, News Corp's chairman, has sought to impress China's Communist rulers and other Asian political leaders. He hopes that by sacking the BBC his cause may be served.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: HK hotel group static at Dollars 40m 
text:  Mandarin Oriental Inter, the hotel group controlled by Jardine Matheson, yesterday announced unchanged net earnings of USDollars 40.8m for 1993, compared with Dollars 40.3m the previous year. Improved contributions from the Hong Kong hotels were offset by weak performances in most other markets, the company said. The results fell short of expectations, and the group has been hit by a fall in hotel visitors. For 1989, profits totalled HKDollars 392.8m (USDollars 50.8m). Some 64 per cent of profits before interest and tax came from Hong Kong and Macao last year, and Mr Robert Riley, managing director, earmarked the colony as one of next year's better performers, due to shrinking supply as hotels are pulled down and converted into office blocks. Mr Riley said the average room rate at the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong was lower than it was in 1989, during which time inflation in the colony had risen more than 50 per cent. This year he sees rates outpacing inflation as the sector attempts to catch up. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'The company's two hotels in Hong Kong should benefit from stronger demand in 1994. 'While the immediate outlook is mixed in the group's other markets, the groundwork has been laid for future growth and the prospects for Mandarin Oriental remain encouraging.' Earning per share were 6 US cents, against 5.94 cents. The group is maintaining a 5 cents a share dividend.

text:  Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking boutique, announced yesterday that Mr Fred Seegal had joined the firm as co-president. He had been joint head of domestic corporate finance at Salomon Brothers. Mr Seegal's appointment - the latest in a series of defections by top Wall Street investment bankers working in the booming mergers and acquisitions business - is Wasserstein Perella's first significant hiring since co-founder Mr Joseph Perella left the firm last July. After the departure of Mr Perella - who has since moved to Morgan Stanley - the firm quickly lost another senior executive when its president, Mr Charles Ward, went to First Boston. Mr Bruce Wasserstein, the current chairman, and founder of the advisory boutique with Mr Perella and two other First Boston executives in 1988, has been running the firm on his own since then. Mr Seegal, who worked at Lehman Brothers before joining Salomon in 1990, is a specialist in advising companies in the media, telecommunications and entertainment industries. However, it is likely he has been hired as much for his management skills as for his experience in the advisory and financing business. He will share the responsibility for managing Wasserstein Perella with Mr Wasserstein. Mr Gary Parr, head of the financial institutions business, is the firm's other co-president. Mr Seegal arrives at a crucial juncture for Wasserstein Perella, which has seen its position in the highly-competitive M&amp;A business slip badly.

headline:  FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Programmed for the Microsoft challenge - Novell's expansion has pitted it directly against the market leader 
text:  The balance of power in the computer software industry has shifted unexpectedly towards the state of Utah, home of Novell, the leading supplier of software for personal computer networks. Novell announced late on Monday that it planned to acquire WordPerfect, a Utah neighbour, for Dollars 1.4bn in stock. At the same time, Novell has purchased the rights to a popular spreadsheet program called Quattro Pro from Borland International for Dollars 145m in cash. Novell shares closed down in heavy trading yesterday, at Dollars 20 from Dollars 23 3/4 on Monday. The moves give Novell an instant stake in the market for application programs, with WordPerfect's word processors and Borland's spreadsheet. They also transform Novell into a software powerhouse with annual revenues of close to Dollars 2bn, second only to Microsoft, the world's largest software company with revenues last year of Dollars 3.75bn. For the first time, Microsoft will face competition from a company with the size and breadth of products to challenge its own market dominance. Novell seems to relish the opportunity for a market battle. There is no love lost between Novell and 'the boys from Seattle', as Mr Raymond Noorda, Novell chief executive, calls Microsoft's youthful executives. Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has charged that Novell 'has a vendetta against us', and Mr Noorda has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive business practices. Microsoft is being investigated by the US Justice Department, and Novell has played an active role in providing information to the anti-trust investigators. Novell has also filed an anti-trust complaint against Microsoft in Europe. However, Mr Noorda carefully avoided any comment on Microsoft yesterday, and analysts said his plans to expand Novell may shift attention away from Microsoft's market dominance. Until now, Novell has competed with Microsoft only in the area of operating systems, the software that controls the basic functions of a computer or network of computers. Novell's Netware is the leading network operating system. Last year, Novell also acquired Unix, a computer operating system widely used in 'open systems' computing. Novell faces increasing competition, however, from Microsoft's recently-introduced Windows NT, an operating system for networked computer systems. With its acquisition of WordPerfect and purchase of Borland's spreadsheet, Novell will now go head to head with Microsoft in the booming market for office software 'suites', or bundles of business software applications, including word-processing, spreadsheets and database management. Novell also plans to leverage its leadership in networking software to create a class of applications products called 'groupware', aimed at teams of workers. Such software would include messaging, task management, document management and workflow tools, Novell said. In this market segment, Novell will compete with Microsoft and Lotus Development, the third-largest personal computer software company. 'The era of stand-alone personal computing is evolving into group collaboration that connects individuals, groups and companies,' said Mr Noorda. 'Novell's objective is to accelerate this market transition.' Yet Novell's expansionary moves also reflect tough times in the software industry, as smaller companies find it increasingly difficult to compete with 'mighty Microsoft', with its broad distribution and marketing clout, and to keep pace with a price war. WordPerfect and Borland have both lost market share over the past year, according to market analysts. WordPerfect has recently laid off more than 1,000 employees, or 17 per cent of its workforce. Borland has faced cashflow problems as it slashed prices in an attempt to gain market share. Borland said on Monday it would restructure its operations, following the sale to Novell of its leading product. Large staff cuts are expected. Novell's extensive distribution network, with 25,000 resellers worldwide, could breath new life into WordPerfect and Borland's spreadsheet business, industry analysts say. Novell faces the challenge, however, of integrating the new businesses into its established operations. 'Mergers are difficult in any industry, but more so in software because you have to combine different code bases, as well as different cultures,' said Mr Pete Higgins, Microsoft vice-president. However, Novell is not new to these challenges. Over the past 10 years the company has acquired no fewer than 15 software companies, although none the size of WordPerfect. And Mr Noorda says long-standing friendships between executives of the two companies, whose offices are just a few miles apart, will help to make the combination 'a natural merger'. A more pressing problem for Novell is who will replace Mr Noorda, who at 69 is about to retire. 'We are on track to find my successor by mid-June,' said Mr Noorda, who has been talking to several industry executives outside the company. Thus, although Mr Noorda may have realised his dream of creating a new 'software powerhouse', the newly-expanded Novell faces significant uncertainties. It also remains to be seen how Lotus Development will react to Novell's expansion plans. Four years ago, Lotus and Novell aborted a planned merger, after the two companies failed to agree on who should head the merged businesses. Mr Noorda says he recently rejected an attempt by Lotus to resurrect talks. Novell's acquisitions do, however, confirm a broad trend in the software industry toward consolidation. Last week, Aldus and Adobe Systems, two leaders in desktop publishing software, also announced plans to merge.

The group said yesterday it did not expect to have to change the figure much. Other insurers have greatly increased their estimates of losses in recent days, putting the total costs of the earthquake to the insurance industry at as much as Dollars 4bn, roughly the same as the costs of Hurricane Hugo. Allstate, the second-largest issuer of homeowners' insurance policies in the state, raised its estimate of its losses from Dollars 350m to Dollars 600m on Monday. State Farm said it had already carried out detailed inspections on around 90 per cent of the claims it had received. These had revealed damage which was broadly in line with what it had estimated.

The company said the plan saw Macy's emergence from protection in January 1995, but gave no further details. The proposals were submitted to Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US secretary of state appointed by a federal bankruptcy court to lead the negotiating process. Macy's creditors, which are owed Dollars 6bn, were due to review them today. On Monday, Mr Vance granted the board a one-day extension to submit a plan after it failed to settle its differences. The board disagreement centred on the valuation the company would place on itself. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of Loews and CBS, was leading one faction in pushing for a Dollars 3.8bn valuation, which would result in a greater return on claims by public bondholders and other junior creditors. Macy's management was urging a Dollars 3.5bn valuation, which would benefit senior creditors.

The South Korean group's CDollars 400m (USDollars 294.1m) plant was closed temporarily last summer because of poor sales of the Sonata car. It was to be re-tooled for assembly, from mid-1995, of the 1996 Elantra for the North American and European markets. Hyundai, however, maintains it can only build the Elantra economically in Korea. A weak Canadian dollar has driven up the cost of parts purchased in US dollars, and the North American Free Trade Agreement has raised duties on all imported parts. Hyundai said the Bromont plant would stay shut indefinitely. An Ontario wheel plant, meanwhile, will be shut down completely and sold. In Ottawa Mr Paul Martin, federal finance minister, said he had raised the Bromont closure with the Korean government. 'We're actively seeking alternative uses,' he said. The Quebec government hinted it might be willing to help if Hyundai agreed to re-open the plant.

text:  Compaq Computer of the US is to build a Dollars 15m assembly plant in Brazil. It should become operational by September, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo. 'Brazil will play a key role for our growth in Latin America,' said Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive officer. He said the plant, which will be located on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, will serve the Latin America and Caribbean region outside Mexico. It will begin by producing desktop models and eventually assemble the full line of Compaq products. Mr Pfeiffer described the planned Brazilian plant as one of 'high volume manufacturing capacity' that would eventually employ around 400 people. He would not comment on production numbers, except to say that it would be in the 'hundreds of thousands of units'. A regional plant should represent substantial production and operational cost-savings, which would be passed on to the consumer, he said. He said the plant was the result of a policy of installing manufacturing operations 'at the heart of our markets'. Compaq has three manufacturing plants - in Texas, Singapore and Scotland - and recently announced plans to open a fourth, in China. Mr Pfeiffer said although the Brazilian plant was due to begin manufacturing by September, the location had not been finalised. The company was looking for an existing building. He said computer peripherals would be provided by traditional suppliers, but added that the company would look into the possibility of buying equipment from Brazilian manufacturers. Mr Manuel Parra, vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean, said Compaq held around 12 per cent of the 400,000-unit Brazilian personal computer market.

headline:  FT  14 SEP 94 / Public sector workers face third year of pay squeeze 
text:  Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is preparing to impose for the third consecutive year a squeeze on the pay of 5m public sector workers. In evidence to be delivered tomorrow to the independent public-sector pay review bodies, the Treasury will insist that there can be no automatic presumption of a pay rise next year for central government and local authority workers. The move implies another freeze in the government's pay bill, with any increases in wages for particular groups of workers dependent on efficiency savings. Mr Clarke will accept that, as this year when most received an additional 2.7 per cent, workers covered by the review bodies will be eligible for modest pay awards when justified by productivity. He will insist that the promise of permanently low inflation means that the annual public-sector pay round can no longer be seen as an automatic entitlement. The pay review bodies, whose recommendations will be published early next year, cover 1.4m nurses, doctors, teachers, members of the armed forces and senior government employees. But the freeze on the pay bill will apply also to the much larger number of workers in central and local government. The expectation in Whitehall is that the 3.5m workers outside the review bodies will face a still tougher squeeze. The Treasury has identified local-authority spending as a particular target for further cuts. Mr Clarke's decision follows a warning to his cabinet colleagues that the windfall savings expected in spending from faster growth and lower inflation must be used to cut the government's borrowing requirement. He is concerned to damp expectations that it will be easy to repeat in the November Budget his success last year in cutting Pounds 10bn from the government's spending targets. Several special factors - including unusually small contributions to the European Union budget and low local-authority borrowing - that helped the Treasury to cut spending this year will be reversed in 1995. Mr Clarke is determined that savings on the government's 'cyclical expenditure' - notably unemployment benefit - is not simply transferred to fund 'structural' spending by Whitehall departments. He has told cabinet colleagues that the overall spending figures set out in his Budget last November represented 'ceilings' rather than targets. The Treasury set a global Whitehall figure of Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and Pounds 272bn for 1996-97, representing increases in real terms of less than 1 per cent each year.

headline:  FT  14 SEP 94 / French government to sell 28% of Renault car group 
text:  The French government yesterday announced plans for a partial privatisation of Renault, the state-owned motor group which is one of the most attractive assets in the country's public sector and a former bastion of union power. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that the government would sell a 28 per cent stake in the company by the end of the year and that the flotation would be accompanied by a FFr2bn (Pounds 240m) capital increase. Industry analysts value the group at between FFr42bn and FFr46bn. The planned flotation follows an agreement with Volvo, the Swedish motor group, which is to reduce its 20 per cent stake in Renault to 12 per cent immediately with the option of selling a further 4 per cent at the time of the share issue. The two companies have been unravelling a complex system of cross-shareholdings since the collapse of merger plans in December last year. Yesterday's announcement follows months of speculation about the sale, which has been complicated by opposition from trade unions and opposition political parties. They claim that privatisation will lead to job losses and that the car company is a national asset which should not be sold. The Confederation Generale du Travail, the communist-led union, said it will take action against the planned share issue. Prime minister Edouard Balladur has sought to defuse union opposition by insisting that Renault will remain in French hands and that the government's stake will remain above 50 per cent. The shares would be offered principally to French investors and Renault employees. Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chairman, welcomed the move. 'We are an increasingly competitive company and it seems to me that what has been decided gives us an additional trump,' he said. The capital increase would give Renault valuable development funds, he added. Industry analysts said they expected strong demand for shares in the automobile company. Renault is one of the most profitable European car manufacturers and is one of the few international car groups to have remained in profit through the industry recession of the past few years. Earlier this month it reported first half net profits of FFr1.7bn, more than double the figure for the same period in 1993. 'The issue will be attractive to the French public because it is regarded as a strong company and because it is a familiar brand,' said one analyst at a Paris securities company. International investors may, however, be frustrated in attempts to buy Renault shares. 'It seems that the amount of stock available will be limited,' one British stockbroker said. Mr Alphandery said that French industrial and financial groups would take part in the partial privatisation. Probable candidates include Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, Banque Nationale de Paris and Groupe Lagardere, the media to missiles company.

text:  French prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur's latest job-creation measures drew a mixed reaction yesterday. The opposition and unions welcomed the proposed government subsidy to companies hiring the long-term unemployed, but scoffed at increased tax incentives to encourage the middle class to hire more servants. In his Sunday night television interview, Mr Balladur also proposed, as 'a collective commitment' for all his countrymen rather than an electoral promise, that the 3.3m jobless total should be reduced by 1m 'over several years'. The Socialist opposition party yesterday criticised the prime minister's plan to quadruple the amount individuals can deduct from their own tax bill in social charges and pay for employees. 'This will help maids in posh areas, but hardly make a big impact on slum unemployment,' said the Socialist spokesman. Mr Balladur's other job plan is to give subsidies to companies hiring those unemployed who have qualified for so-called RMI welfare payments for at least two years, and who are at the bottom of the heap of French society. France's Patronat employers' federation said yesterday it was launching its own inquiry into corporate ethics and relations with the law and politics, following a series of corruption allegations against the heads of leading companies. The Patronat move follows Mr Balladur's announcement that he would appoint a three-man committee composed of a former Patronat president, a former union leader and a senior magistrate to report on issues raised by the scandals. Mr Francois Perigot, the Patronat president, said his inquiry 'would question everyone concerned by this dysfunctioning of the system'.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher unsettled 
text:  Stores group Kingfisher saw an early gain clipped back as worrying stories of executive changes moved through the market ahead of the company's interim figures, due today. The Woolworths and B&amp;Q parent has suffered from what many in the market see as an unsuccessful sales policy known as 'Every Day Low Pricing', and concern over the competition in the DIY market from Home Depot, of the US. Full-year forecasts have edged down and the share price has tumbled from almost 780p at the peak in December. There was talk yesterday that Mr James Kerr-Muir, the finance director who replaced current Asda chairman Archie Norman, could be under pressure. But there is also thought to be little love lost between chairman Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy and Mr Alan Smith, the chief executive. Kingfisher had been up 6 but ended the day only 2 better at 490p. Banks and insurances were among the market's best performing areas, with the former given a strong push by the move to higher interest rates in the UK, which dealers said would help boost margins for the banks. Barclays was the star turn, racing up 10 more to 595p, helped by recent broker buy recommendations; turnover was 6.6m shares. The sharp slide on the Hong Kong market, ahead of the visit by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK home secretary, later this week, upset HSBC Holdings, which fell 11 to 737p and put pressure on Standard Chartered, 4 cheaper at 267p. Composite insurances attracted solid support and were not badly affected by reports of an earth tremor in the US. Guardian Royal Exchange moved up 6 to 193p, Royal 7 to 281p and General Accident 10 to 564p. Prudential was the pick of the life assurances, closing 4 1/2 firmer at 315 1/2 p at the start of an important week which brings interims from Prudential, Legal &amp; General and United Friendly. Clothes retailer Country Casuals fell 32 to 120p after warning that full-year profits would be below expectations. Meanwhile, Liberty dropped 33 to 355p after announcing losses of Pounds 301,000 in the six months to July, against profits of Pounds 601,000 previously. There was more news of share buy-backs in the utilities areas of the market. PowerGen settled 2 easier at 569p after buying a block of 2.5m shares at 573p. In the regional electricity stocks, Seeboard purchased 1m shares at 434p; its shares eased 6 to 434p. Transport shares came under pressure on the back of a reappraisal of debt worries following the rise in bank base rates. Eurotunnel tumbled 9 to 270p and British Airways, another heavy borrower, ended 5 lower at 397p. Ahead of tomorrow's half-year statement, Associated British Ports fell 13 to 269p, not helped by bearish comment in the weekend press. British Aerospace ended a penny off at 496p in the wake of denials of a deal with Germany's corporate monolith Daimler-Benz. Weekend press comment to the effect that BAe was discussing the sale of its business interests in Airbus Industrie was flatly denied by the company, with BAe declaring itself 'absolutely committed to Airbus'. Fairey, the defence electronics group, jumped 16 to 399p following a surge in profits. Circulation figures for August led to cautionary reading for News International, the Murdoch group which sparked off the newspaper price war. SG Warburg pointed out to clients that while Sun sales rose 0.2 per cent, the sales of its chief rivals, the Mirror and Daily record, rose a combined 2.1 per cent. At the other end of the spectrum, sales of Mr Murdoch's Times were down 0.3 per cent, while the Telegraph had rebounded 1.9 per cent. News International fell 11 to 239p and Mirror Group was steady at 137p. The Telegraph slipped 5 to 349p. Other statistics, Page 43

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline firm 
text:  The market decided that SmithKline Beecham had secured a good price for the US over-the-counter arm of its recently acquired Sterling Health business. The shares shrugged off interest rate concern to move up 7 1/2 before closing 4 ahead at 425 1/2 p. SmithKline sold the business to Bayer, of Germany, which some analysts believed had been prepared to pay a premium for the emotional content of the acquisition. The company, which invented aspirin, lost title in the US after the First World War as a result of allied reparation demands. Mr Robin Gilbert of Panmure Gordon had factored in between Dollars 600m and Dollars 700m for the disposal and was surprised that it had achieved Dollars 1bn. He said the move would go a considerable way to dispersing the gloom over SmithKline's gearing, which had leapt to a very high level following the Dollars 2.7bn acquisition of the entire Sterling Health business.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Building sector upset 
text:  News of the 1/2 percentage point increase in UK interest rates shocked the building and property sectors of the market and caused marketmakers to lower share prices in those groups to head off any selling pressure. In the event there was no heavyweight selling in either sector. Shares embarked on a modest rally later in the session, although they closed well down on the day. One leading marketmaker in building stocks said the sector had been under substantial pressure last week when serious talk of possible interest rate rises first began to circulate. 'Most of the selling was done then; if anything, the rate rise has cleared the air,' he added. Building sector analysts took the view that the market had mostly factored in rate rises. Mr Simon Brown, building analyst at SGST Securities, commented: 'The impact on the housebuilders will be more psychological than actual. If anything it could tip prospective buyers over the edge. If they think interest rates are going up they will want to move quickly to close their mortgage arrangements.' Analysts said the rate rise would have little impact on the big building materials groups, which derive much of their earnings from overseas. In the housebuilders, Barratt Developments plummeted to 191p before steadying to close a net 14 off at 214p; the company reports interim figures next Wednesday. Wilson Connolly dipped 8 to 203p and Wilson Bowden 11 to 397p. Land Securities, the premier property stock in the UK market, fell 7 1/2 to 615 1/2 p, with a hefty 3.2m shares traded, and MEPC was 5 easier at 430p.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities stand up well after base rate news - Market report 
text:  The  1/2 percentage point rise in the Bank of England's key lending rate failed to upset the UK stock market to any significant degree. Market strategists applauded Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, for his courage in making a pre-emptive strike on base rates, without waiting for inflationary pressures to reach threatening proportions. The rate increase was thought unlikely to check significantly the recovery in the UK economy, or in company profits and dividends. By the close of trading the FT-SE 100-share Index had recovered more than half of its initial fall, with the final reading of 3,128.8 showing a net loss of only 10.5 points - by no means a serious setback. The equity market took its lead from the UK government bond market, where long-dated issues closed very firmly. At least one leading securities house raised its forecasts for both the UK economy and the Footsie index, while at the same time predicting that interest rates could reach 8 per cent by the end of next year. The timing of the Bank's move caught out some traders who had relaxed their interest rate caution after last week's meeting between the chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England had appeared to pass off without drama. But the disclosure yesterday morning that UK producer output prices had risen by an unexpected 0.3 per cent in August halted an initial improvement in share prices and gave the market 20 minutes warning of a possible move on interest rates. Shares quickly plunged when the news came, driven by determined selling of stock index futures by the locals, or independent, futures traders. Within an hour, the Footsie had transformed a 1.9-point gain to a loss of 25.3. However, the 3,114 mark proved to be the day's low and most of the gain had been recovered as London waited for Wall Street to reopen after its uncomfortable session on Friday. In the event, Wall Street was only 3 Dow points off in UK hours, but sudden weakness in the US dollar hit the blue chip international stocks in the UK market and pushed the Footsie down again. The focus also fell on interest-related stocks. Store and retail issues performed fairly well, with the leaders showing either very modest losses or, in some cases, holding steady. There were casualties among the housebuilding companies, which faced two adverse factors; higher base rates hit their costs and the danger of a rise in mortgage rates - some building societies said yesterday they would raise rates - threatens the still fragile recovery in the housing market. The second line stocks, having joined in the general shakeout in the market, were slower than the blue chips to respond to the improvement in bonds. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 22.7 down at 3,713.3. But trading volumes were moderate, with the Seaq-reported total of 484.6m some 25 per cent down from Friday's figure. Retail business on Friday was worth Pounds 1.28bn. By the close, the market's attention was switching to prospects for today's US consumer prices data, which could renew the pressures on the Federal Reserve caused by the producer price figures announced before the weekend. There was also uncertainty ahead of the Bundesbank policy meeting on Thursday, with some analysts suggesting that German rates could still be reduced. On the domestic front, the market faces the retail price index for August, due tomorrow. Although any sting in these figures appears to have been drawn by the pre-emptive move on base rates, some traders warned that any sharp rise in RPI could still upset the stock market.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading 
text:  Stock index futures ran into some heavy selling following the announcement of higher UK interest rates, but staged a good rally later when trading volume died down. At the close the September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which expires at the end of the week, stood at 3,112, a discount of 16 to the underlying cash market, with the fair value premium adjusted to around 3 points to allow for the rise in interest rates on carrying costs. The selling came mostly from the locals, or independent, traders, with one source hitting the contract hard. In the hectic period following the Bank of England's announcement, the contract dropped to a low of 3,101, only to recover strongly and reach a high for the day of 3,140 in mid-afternoon. Trading volume of just under 18,000 September contracts was high but not by any means dramatic, and included a significant proportion of roll-over deals into the December contract. Traders believe that most of these deals have now been completed, opening the way for a smooth expiry operation on Friday. Volume in traded options increased to 42,477 contracts, from under 41,000 on Friday, but the Footsie option saw reduced activity of 12,872 lots. Among individual stock options, Hanson was the most active with 2,647 dealt.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips as takeover news holds attention 
text:  Wall Street US share prices receded yesterday in a mostly lacklustre session highlighted by takeover news in the food, insurance and health care sectors, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.47 lower at 3,860.34, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.97 to 466.21. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up a scant 0.52 at 455.06 but the Nasdaq composite receded 3.72 to 760.01. For the most part it was a day of waiting on Wall Street. Many investors were quietly adjusting their positions ahead of the release this morning of the August consumer price index. As a result, volume was light, with 245m shares traded on the Big Board by the close. Before a sharp increase in producer prices was revealed last week, analysts were forecasting a 0.4 per cent increase in the CPI. If the data came in higher, as some observers feared yesterday, stocks could tumble along with bond prices, as they had done on Friday. In the meantime, an uneasy calm prevailed, although the Dow industrials were hurt by a Dollars 1 1/4 decline in Caterpillar's share price to Dollars 54 1/4 . The company, which relies heavily on export markets, appeared vulnerable after reports suggesting that Congress might not ratify the Gatt world trade agreement this year. International Paper lost Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 73 1/8 . Elsewhere, blue chips languished in sluggish activity. In spite of the overall lack of direction, a fresh batch of takeovers and a wave of speculation on deals in the works inspired brisk trading in some individual issues. The day's most significant development was the announcement that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts would offer RJR Nabisco stock for all of Borden's common shares, in a deal valued at Dollars 2bn. Borden's share price, which had been hovering near its 52-week low, climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 13 5/8 , while RJR retreated Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 . In health care, GenCare Health Systems jumped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 46 after agreeing to be acquired by United Healthcare for Dollars 520m in cash. United was marked down Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53. By contrast, investors were cool to the news that two life insurers were merging. USLICO retreated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 and NWNL fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 after announcing a Dollars 237m unification pact. Woolworth added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 17 3/4 on a published report that raised the possibility of a leveraged buyout of the retailer for Dollars 2.3bn, or Dollars 25 a share. In pharmaceuticals, takeover speculation continued to swirl around Warner-Lambert, sending it down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 81 1/2 . SmithKline Beecham was marked up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 30 1/8 after agreeing to sell the North American over-the-counter drugs business of its Sterling Winthrop unit to Bayer's Miles Laboratories. Canada After a sharp morning fall, share prices in Toronto staged an afternoon recovery to close little changed. Some analysts believed that the relative stability of the market suggested that investors had already discounted an expected victory by the separatist Parti Quebecois in yesterday's Quebec provincial election. The TSE 300 index was finally up 0.73 of a point at 4,329.87 as losing issues outnumbered rises by 418 to 309 after volume of 72.2m shares.

The overall index, after edging higher at the start, finished 63 down at 5,892, while golds lost 45 at 2,419 and industrials dipped 22 to 6,595. Traders said short term equity index futures, which close out on Thursday, were calling golds slightly better but were discounting a fall in the industrial and overall indices. The newly listed Nasionale Pers added R2 at R21 - sharply above expectations which were as low as R17 - in heavy volume of R115m. Iscor lost 12 cents at R4.58 as profits continued to be taken after recent gains.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity markets feels sting in tail 
text:  The world's equity markets were broadly lower over a week which brought a sting in its tail. On Friday, Wall Street and leading European markets finished in retreat in reaction to US figures showing an unexpectedly sharp rise in wholesale prices during August, which raised the spectre of rising inflation and interest rates. Italy was the week's biggest loser, weighed down by worries about cabinet splits and vacillation, and doubts about the government's ability to take decisive action on the 1995 budget. Last week's focus was on government plans to cut at least L8,000bn from pensions, prompting trade union threats of a 'hot autumn' of conflict if the proposals were not rewritten. Today, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, meets the unions to discuss the issue in what is being seen as the first real test of his stated resolve to take firm, but fair, measures on the economy.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change    % change                 % change in local currency **   sterling **   in US                                                             Dollars **             ----------------------------------------------------------               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                          1994      1994        1994  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        +0.17    +2.92   +9.40   -4.29     +2.57       +7.52 Belgium        -2.07    -1.33   +6.53   -5.21     +2.93       +7.90 Denmark        -1.70    -3.83   +1.48   -7.24     -1.39       +3.37 Finland        +0.47   +10.66  +43.31  +27.38    +40.70      +47.48 France         -3.01    -2.34   -4.07  -12.32     -6.52       -2.01 Germany        -0.60    +2.97  +13.45   -4.77     +2.31       +7.24 Ireland        -1.00    +5.24  +18.57   +5.73     +9.62      +14.91 Italy          -4.94    +1.59   +6.93   +6.25    +10.39      +15.70 Netherlands    -1.61    +0.81  +12.50   -2.96     +3.99       +9.00 Norway         -2.35    -0.61  +17.52   +2.86     +8.80      +14.04 Spain          -0.32    -3.39   -0.51   -8.88     -3.20       +1.46 Sweden         -2.13    +2.59  +13.24   +3.77     +9.16      +14.43 Switzerland    -1.26    +1.61  +11.92   -9.36     -0.16       +4.66 UK             -2.43    -0.13   +3.84   -7.42     -7.42       -2.96 EUROPE         -2.07    +0.34   +6.03   -6.27     -2.15       +2.57  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia      -2.29    +0.18   +7.73   -4.37     +0.11       +4.94 Hong Kong      +2.98    +8.05  +37.96  -14.90    -18.81      -14.90 Japan          -3.39    -3.99   -4.90   +9.03    +16.94      +22.58 Malaysia       +3.08    +8.18  +44.97   -6.61     -6.12       -1.59 New Zealand    -0.23    +6.26  +12.03   +2.71     +5.85      +10.96 Singapore      -1.51    -0.16  +17.45   -8.24     -5.93       -1.40  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada         -0.22    +4.26  +12.99   +2.86     -5.12       -0.54 USA            -0.64    +1.19   +2.16   +0.56     -4.06       -0.56 Mexico         +2.63    +4.87  +42.45   +5.46     -8.19       -3.76  --------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa   +1.09    +2.27  +60.90  +22.05    +10.75      +16.10  --------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX    -1.68    -0.31   +2.83   +0.56     +1.68       +6.58  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on September 9th 1994.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains ground for the first time in six sessions 
text:  Equities rose for the first time in six trading days, but concern about oversupply weighed on activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average was up 19.40 at 19,917.28 after a day's high of 19,973.39 and low of 19,882.58. Institutional investors and public funds supported share prices, but the upside was limited by small-lot sales and arbitrage unwinding. Volume was only 194m shares, against Friday's 581m. Investor confidence remained depressed as Japan Telecom, the long distance telecommunications operator listed on the second section last week, lost further ground. Friday's Wall Street decline also weighed on sentiment. Traders said worries over the listing of Japan Tobacco next week prevailed. 'The sentiment indicators like the ratio of put and call options show that people are more bearish than the same time last year,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson. Investors are also wary of Matsushita Electric Industrial's planned Y200bn convertible bonds issuance early next month. The Topix index of all first section stocks eased 0.43 to 1,586.17 and the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.16 to 289.04. Falls led rises by 488 to 464, with 229 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.89 to 1,291.39. Japan Telecom posted a new low of Y4.27m, falling Y13,000. Other telecommunication stocks were also lower, with DDI down Y9,000 to Y898,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y1,000 to Y884,000. Steels were firm on selling and buying back activity by investors who wanted to realise profits ahead of the September book closing. Nippon Steel rose Y5 to Y375. Some banks, which were down last week on profit-taking, rallied. Bank of Tokyo put on Y20 at Y1,510. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y30 to Y1,620 on fears of oversupply caused by its expected convertible bond issue. Sumitomo Bakelite dropped Y26 to Y691 due to the weakness of its convertible bonds floated last week. Daito Trust Construction fell by its daily limit of Y400 to Y1,620 following reports of sharply lower pre-tax profits projections for the current business year to next March. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 21.80 to 22,228.12 in volume of 42m shares. Rohm, a semiconductor device maker, rose Y80 to Y4,260 on a higher pre-tax profits forecast. Roundup The region's markets reflected the fall on Wall Street on Friday, and fears of an interest rate rise. HONG KONG slid 2.5 per cent, with Chinese-incorporated issues the hardest hit after a recent rally, followed by the interest rate-sensitive property sector. The Hang Seng index shed 254.65 to 9,890.37, not far above the day's low of 9,856.11. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 5.08bn, down from Friday's HKDollars 7.28bn. The H share index of China incorporated companies fell 46.67, or 3.2 per cent, to 1,431.42. Among H shares, Shanghai Petrochemical declined 8 cents to HKDollars 2.74, Maanshan Iron and Steel also 8 cents to HKDollars 2.71 and Donfang Electric 42 cents to HKDollars 4.10. Property companies, highly sensitive to interest rate moves, were heavily sold: Sun Hung Kai Properties fell HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 58 and Cheung Kong HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 39.20. Elsewhere, Guoco Group retreated HKDollars 1.30 to HKDollars 37.70, having made ground recently on speculation that it would be chosen to replace the Jardine companies in the Hang Seng index following the latter's delisting. SYDNEY retreated further after Friday's decline. The All Ordinaries index lost 37.7, or 1.8 per cent, at 2,032.9, while the All Industrials index fell 61.1 to 2,881.9 and All Resources 19.7 to 1,403.4. News Corp dropped 38 cents to ADollars 8.32 and John Fairfax was down 13 cents at ADollars 2.67. KUALA LUMPUR fell back on selling of blue chips which knocked 1 per cent off the market's benchmark index. The composite index shed 12.61 to 1,169.05. Brokers said the index showed resilience at lower levels and they expected strong support at the 1,150 level. Volume was 343m shares and losers led gainers by 301 to 141. Golden Plus gained 80 cents at MDollars 14.90 on reports that the the company would announce a major project this week. MANILA was depressed by losses in the major stocks. The composite index fell 62.14 to 2,919.31, with PLDT sliding 1.3 per cent to 1,545 pesos and San Miguel 'A' 1.5 per cent to 98 pesos. TAIPEI slipped under the 7,000 mark in a volatile session. The weighted index dipped 32.34 to 6,967.48, after reaching an intraday high of 7,042.07. Turnover was thin at TDollars 57bn. Recently listed Taiwan Semiconductor climbed by the daily 7 per cent limit for the seventh straight sesion, adding TDollars 9 at TDollars 142.50 on volume of 3.8m shares. Textiles made headway, Carnival Textile climbing TDollars 1.60 to TDollars 28.60 and Reward Wool 90 cents to TDollars 48.70. SEOUL extended early gains in spite of selling intervention by the stock market stabilisation fund. The composite stock index rose 9.18 to 995.70. Advances exceeded declines by 483 to 325, with 175 going limit up. Samsung Electronics staged a rebound, rising the day's limit of Won3,000 to Won138,700. SINGAPORE was broadly lower in thin trade. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 19.57 to 2,280.39, with an estimated 170m shares traded. BOMBAY climbed to a record high on continued speculative buying. The BSE index closed at a provisional 4,643.31, up 92.36 or 2 per cent. Brokers said better half-year results helped the rally. The BSE index has shown a steady upward movement throughout the year and is now 34 per cent higher than its year's opening of 3,465.86. Brokers attributed the speculative interest to strong hopes that the Securities and Exchange Board of India would approve a recent BSE proposal for the introduction of a 90-day futures contract. BANGKOK declined on fears of a possible interest rate rise. The SET index closed 18.44, or 1.2 per cent, lower at 1,490.41. Turnover was Bt7.4bn. Stocks fell across the board, led by banks which lost 2.2 per cent. WELLINGTON followed the region's trend, losing 2.2 per cent.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rise in UK base rates unsettles the Continent 
text:  It was a day of contrasts among the Continent's markets yesterday. FRANKFURT fell back sharply during an active session. The Dax index sank 30.54 to 2,154.61, moving within a range of 2,140.66 and 2,154.66 during the day. In the post-bourse the Ibis-indicated index gained slightly to 2,155.99. Of the 30 DAX stocks, declining issues outnumbered advances by 26 to 4. Turnover amounted to DM5bn. Lufthansa was actively traded on news, within market expectations, that it was to offer 7.64m new ordinary shares to existing shareholders at a price of DM160. Shareholders would be able to buy one new share for every four held. The airline's shares improved DM3 to DM200. The government is not taking part in the rights issue, so reducing its stake from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent. The 3.9m shares which the government will take up will be sold to investors at home and abroad, excluding the US, via a syndicate of international banks led by Dresdner Bank. Bayer dropped DM6.50 to DM368.50 on news that it had paid Dollars 1bn for the right to acquire the North American over-the-counter pharmaceuticals activities of Sterling-Winthrop from SmithKline Beecham. The acquisition includes the right to use the Bayer name in North America, lost some 75 years ago. PARIS overcame a weak opening, following the rise in UK interest rates, on an improvement in the bond market. The CAC-40 index added 17.96 at 1,966.79. Turnover was light at FFr2.5bn. There was further negative news for Saint-Gobain with reports that an executive of a subsidiary was to be questioned by magistrates. However, the shares made ground on expectations of good first-half results being reported on Thursday, firming FFr4 to FFr640. MILAN was lower, awaiting today's meeting between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, and the trades unions over pension reform, and depressed by the UK's move on interest rates. The Comit index weakened 13.70, or 2.1 per cent, to 648.83. Goldman Sachs, which is keeping its rolling 12-month Comit index target unchanged at 800, said it continued to expect the strong earnings momentum and slightly more attractive valuation to support a 17 to 20 per cent total annual return for equities, even though the short term prospects were suffering from a high level of uncertainty over the government's fiscal policy. Olivetti, L52 or 2.6 per cent lower at L1,954, continued to be pressured by worries that first-half results might disappoint the market, and the investigation into the awards of state contracts. Cir, the industrial holding company, gave up a further L47, or 2.4 per cent, to L1,936. Against the trend, Ciga, the luxury hotels group, rose L12 to L1,088. At the weekend, ITT-Sheraton fixed its public buy offer for 367m shares at L1,102 a share. The offer begins next Monday and if successful would leave Sheraton with 70 per cent of Ciga. ZURICH was closed for a local holiday, but prices overcame early weakness in active Basle trading after Wall Street's firm opening. The SMI index, down 17.6 early in the day, finished 0.9 higher at 2,643.0. Banks led the uptrend, with CS Holding putting on SFr7 at SFr563 after the group said it was withdrawing its offer for Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein. UBS bearers were SFr4 higher at SFr1,209. Insurers and industrial shares mostly closed with marginal losses. Registered shares in Sandoz fell SFr5 to SFr670. AMSTERDAM was broadly lower, although some gains were seen during the session, particularly from Heineken, up Fl 3.60 at Fl 248.10, following the strong performance on Friday. The AEX index finished 1.38 down at 411.81. MADRID, returning from a long holiday weekend, dipped 2.1 per cent as it caught up with Friday's losses in other European markets. The general index fell 6.46 to 298.72 in slim volume of below Pta20bn as the market awaited today's Spanish and US inflation data. Among heavily hit banks, Santander and Argentaria each fell Pta100 to Pta5,120 and Pta5,210 respectively. DUBLIN drifted lower in thin volume and the ISEQ overall index closed 10.76 easier at 1,909.34. One analyst commented that the Irish central bank had no need to follow the interest rate lead from London on economic grounds, and would, indeed, be anxious to demonstrate its autonomy. STOCKHOLM advanced strongly, with heavy demand seen for Astra. The Affarsvarlden general index gained 9.4 at 1,450.3. Good demand for Swedish bonds and a firmer krona led to a decline in interest rates and provided support for the bourse. Astra saw turnover of SKr800m, or some 28 per cent of the day's total of SKr2.9bn, and the 'A' shares rose SKr3 to SKr186 while the 'B' finished SKr4 up at SKr185.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Markets Report: UK rate rise lifts sterling 
text:  Sterling made good gains yesterday after the Bank of England's unexpected decision to lift the minimum lending rate by 50 basis points to 5.75 per cent, writes Philip Gawith. The pound rose some two pfennigs, and more than a cent, on the news before levelling out to close in London at DM2.4117 and Dollars 1.5626, from DM2.3914 and Dollars 1.5509 on Friday. The trade weighted index finished at 79.1 from 78.6. Analysts, however, stopped short of saying that sterling had managed to detach itself from the downtow of the dollar. The rate move appears to have put a floor under the currency, rather than to have necessarily given it any significant upside momentum. Sterling futures lost a lot of ground, the September contract trading 38,000 lots to close 40 points lower, at 94.07 from 94.47. The December contract saw nearly 88,000 lots dealt and ended at 93.30, down 37 basis points from Friday's close. The rise in UK rates overshadowed activities in Europe, where most currencies had a generally quieter day. The dollar was slightly firmer against the D-Mark but weaker in terms of the yen, ahead of today's release of the August US consumer price index. The release will be closely watched following the dollar's two-pfennig drop last Friday, on news that the August PPI rose 0.6 per cent. The US currency finished in London at DM1.5435 from DM1.5419 and at Y98.985 from Y99.265. It ended in New York at DM1.5433 and Y99.15. The decision to raise rates was widely, though not universally, welcomed. Most saw it as a timely pre-emptive strike against inflation. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, boosted his credibility through his apparent willingness to place the economy above party politics. The Bank of England's reputation was also enhanced, in the eyes of some. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist in London at Bank of America, said: 'The clear message is that the Bank of England has much more independence in setting monetary policy than it has had in its history.' He added that this had to be a plus factor for sterling, in the long term. Although the decision to lift rates caught most offside, it did not come entirely out of the blue. Mr Philip Shaw, economist at Union Discount, noted that three-month sterling LIBOR had been above base rates since July. The Bank had made no effort to protest, which suggested it was happy to leave markets with the impression that rates would rise. The handling, and timing, of the move was criticised by some money market practitioners. Some felt that the Bank had misled the market by, in its daily operations last Thursday, offering a repurchase agreement which gave assistance at the established (lower) rate. Many took this as a clear signal that rates were on hold. But others supported the Bank on this count. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC, said: 'There have been several occasions in the past when we have had a rate move with a repo outstanding.' Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, also warned: 'My experience in the money markets has been: never say never.' Both, however, were critical of the handling of the move. 'The Bank has used its discretion over the precise timing of a rate change in a way which unsettles investors, destabilises traders and maximises uncertainty about future changes,' added Mr Parsons. Mr MacKinnon said it was easier to read the intentions of the Fed and Bundesbank. 'With the Bank of England we still live in Smiley's world of secrecy.' He said the fact that some highly respected economists had been wrong-footed 'shows how the Bank has made confusing and misleading signals to the market'. Some money market operators were also critical that the Bank could have set a 5.19688 per cent interest rate, on a Pounds 4.5bn floating rate gilt issue, last Friday. Official sources pointed out, however, that the quarterly date for changing the interest rate was inflexible, and set months in advance. The D-Mark finished weaker against most currencies. Analysts said markets were beginning to worry whether Chancellor Kohl's governing coalition would win an outright majority in the national elections in October. The German unit closed at SKr4.853, from SKr4.902. Against the French franc it stood at FFr3.425 from FFr3.427. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 180m late assistance. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 624m liquidity at the new rate of 5 5/8 per cent, up from 5 1/8 per cent. Overnight money traded between 4 3/4 and 7 per cent. Cash market rates moved up in line with the higher base rate. Three-month LIBOR ended at 5 7/8 per cent from Friday's 5 7/16 . One-year LIBOR closed at 7 1/8 per cent from 6 13/16 . Analysts said the sharp move in short sterling was an over-reaction, reflecting the extent to which the market had assumed rates would not be moving. One source argued that if the Bank had moved on Thursday, losses would have been much reduced.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: France seeks lower rate of land set-aside 
text:  France believes that, if the European Union does not substantially reduce the share of arable land set aside from production next year, the EU may have to decrease exports or increase imports, officials in Paris said yesterday. Last week the French government sent the European Commission a long-promised memorandum containing the reforms on which Paris would like to see progress during the French presidency of the EU in the first half of 1995. In particular, France said it wanted to see the current 15 per cent average rate of 'set-aside' in the EU reduced 'substantially'. Otherwise, the French calculate, EU cereal stocks could fall to close to zero next year after the fall from 20m to 10m tonnes this year. 'Such a level would not be manageable,' said an agriculture ministry official. By French calculations, this year's harvest of 158m-162m tonnes, plus 5m tonnes of imports, would amount to some 10m tonnes less than the total of anticipated consumption of 140m-145m tonnes plus around 32m tonnes of exports. If stocks dropped to near zero 'either we would not be able to export as much as permitted by the Gatt or we would have to increase imports', said the official. Another French aim is to improve the competitiveness of EU agriculture to avoid Gatt-required cuts in subsidised exports. The limits to subsidising exports were illustrated in the past few days when France failed to firm up a preliminary contract to sell China up to 1m tonnes of wheat because a Brussels offer of a subsidy of Ecus 5 a tonne proved insufficient to bring the price low enough.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Crop fears lift potato prices - Market jitters mean good news for beleaguered British growers 
text:  There is nothing like the suspicion of a shortage to stir up the markets - and the effect this has had on potato prices has put smiles back on the faces of Britain's 15,000 growers. Paradoxically, prices are rising mainly because the crops growers are harvesting are producing below budgeted yields. Twelve months ago, when last year's potatoes were being lifted, prices paid to farmers were around Pounds 60 per tonne. Excess supply kept the average ex-farm price around the same level until June this year. It was a barely break-even return for even the most efficient growers and resulted in substantial losses. This year has been different - and looks like continuing that way. There are three main reasons for this. First, last year's losses led to a slight under-planting against quotas in spring 1994 by growers who were feeling insecure. Not only had they made inadequate returns on their 1993 potatoes, they had also been forced to lift them during the wettest autumn for years. Second, they were aware that the future of the Potato Marketing Board, on which they had relied since the 1930s to support the market, was under threat from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Third, the spring was wet, cold and late. This meant that most potatoes were planted several weeks later than optimum, and soil temperatures were too low to promote normal growth. Early growth and maximum leaf cover before the heat of the summer are crucial to high yields, and in many cases this year that cover was not achieved in time - a problem made much worse by the July heatwave. This combination was potentially lethal for the potato crop, and 20 years ago would have led to a truly disastrous shortage. Fortunately about 60 per cent of UK potato growers are now able to irrigate their crops, saving a great many potatoes from being virtually burned in the soil. As a result domestic supplies, although reduced, should be adequate - with a little luck. That luck will be needed during the next few weeks as the so-called maincrop potato harvest gets under way. Provided there is not too much rain, the remaining acreage should be gathered safely, guaranteeing supplies until next spring. It is the possibility that the weather could turn wet again - and that this could cause losses when supplies are tight - that is presumably behind the feverish futures market and the high spot prices. Most farmers are being paid at least Pounds 100 per tonne - and in some cases Pounds 150 per tonne - more for potatoes this year than last. The futures price for next May went up last week to Pounds 240 per tonne. Given that this year's anticipated tonnage is 5.5m-5.6m tonnes, compared with about 6.2m tonnes last year, it may appear difficult to understand why prices should be so much higher. One reason may be that there is a shortage of alternative supplies in Europe. In Amsterdam and Lille, for instance, potato futures markets are said to be even more excited than London's. The same weather that reduced UK potato yields has affected crops in Holland and France, and those countries which can usually be relied on as sources of cheap surpluses are unlikely to be able to oblige this year. There will be plenty of happy faces at this week's potato harvesting demonstration near York, for there are few farm crops which respond to the suspicion of a shortage more dramatically than potatoes. This buoyancy has led to headlines in the tabloid press saying that retail potato prices will double or more during the coming winter. The sources of these stories can only be guessed at, but are they justified? Consider these figures: the current ex-farm price for top quality King Edward potatoes is Pounds 200 per tonne, or 20p per kg. The wholesale price for the same grade and the same variety is 24p per kg. But last weekend the retail price for King Edwards, packed in plastic bags of 2.5kg at my local supermarket, was 66p per kg - or Pounds 660 per tonne. I am well aware that packing, transporting and displaying potatoes on shelves costs money. But I would have thought there was a sufficient margin between the wholesale price and retail price for a fair proportion of the kind of ex-farm increases I have described to be absorbed without significantly affecting profitability. Retailers often say that consumers prefer price stability. No doubt that is why they hold prices higher than they need to be when wholesale levels fall. Many farmers believe that policy has governed the retail price of potatoes over a number of years. The coming winter will be an ideal opportunity for those retailers to demonstrate that they really do believe in price stability - even when the market goes modestly against them.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Lack of attention to customers' says Tesco 
text:  The UK potato industry pays too little attention to its customers, Tesco, the supermarket group, said yesterday. Mr Andrew Batty, Tesco's fresh produce trading manager, told the World Potato Congress in Harrogate, Yorkshire, that consumers wanted quality, value and reassurance that the food they bought was health-giving and produced with the minimum of chemicals. They were also spoilt for choice. Yet he said: 'One of the things that continues to amaze me about our industry is how much emphasis we put on the growing side of the business and how little we put into understanding what the customer wants.' Mr Batty told the Congress, attended by delegates from about 50 countries, that the supply chain had to become more efficient if growers, processors and supermarkets were to make enough money to survive and re-invest. Tesco has just commissioned research from Adas, the government's farm advisory service, into the feasibility of supply contracts between the group and growers. Mr Batty acknowledged that growers faced an uncertain future with the abolition of the statutory Potato Marketing Board in 1997. 'In periods of uncertainty it's always best to concentrate on what one does best. It is up to us to get on with the business of selling potatoes, as a team clearly focused on providing what the customer wants.'

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium market bullish despite increase in stocks 
text:  A bigger-than-expected rise in producer stocks reported yesterday took the aluminium market by surprise. But, once the initial impact was absorbed, the news made scarcely a dent on the market's bullish sentiment and the aluminium price seemed determined to keep heading towards USDollars 1,600 a tonne. Many analysts had been predicting that the International Primary Aluminium Institute (IPAI) would report producer stocks virtually unchanged. However, the organisation said total stocks, which had fallen every month since February, rose by 80,000 tonnes in July to 3.614m tonnes. Some traders pointed out that July marked the start of shut-downs for the northern hemisphere summer holidays in many aluminium consuming industries. Also, a fall in London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks in July - by a record 104,000 tonnes - more than compensated for the rise in producer stocks. They suggested that aluminium would go on to test Dollars 1,600 a tonne, which analysts say is the next important technical resistance point. There were words of caution from some observers, however. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the aluminium price was getting ahead of itself. 'There are still huge stocks overhanding the market - about 14 weeks of consumption - and eventually the market will realise this and settle down to sideways trading. Things are often overdone in the early stages of a recovery and the first-quarter rise in (aluminium) prices is not sustainable to the year-end.' The output cuts made by aluminium producers so far this year were 'having an impact beyond their wildest dreams'. As long as the producers stuck to their guns, there would be a supply deficit of about 400,000 tonnes this year and one of 1m tonnes in 1995, he said. Consequently, Mr MacMillan is forecasting aluminium prices averaging 65 cents a lb this year (Dollars 1,433 a tonne) and 75 cents (Dollars 1,653) in 1995. Aluminium for delivery in three months on the LME closed last night up Dollars 5.25 a tonne at Dollars 1,592.

text:  The US Department of Agriculture boosted its estimate of this year's soyabean harvest yesterday, saying it would be the largest ever. The revised forecast of 2.316bn bushels was up from an August estimate of 2.282bn. The previous record was 2.261bn bushels in 1979. The USDA also raised its prediction for the US maize crop to 9.257bn bushels. It had previously forecast 9.214bn bushels. Mr William Biedermann, an market analyst for the advisory firm Allendale, Inc., said that projections for US maize production were likely to rise as the harvest continued. 'Big crops get bigger,' he said. Although the forecast for record production weighed on soyabean futures prices at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, maize prices were higher at mid-session. 'The USDA expanded its figures for domestic and export use for corn, so carry-over stocks don't rise,' said Mr Jerry Gidel, grain analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago. Wheat prices also rallied as the USDA dropped its world carry-over figure to 119.4m tonnes, supporting traders' belief that the Australian wheat crop would continue to deteriorate. As wheat prices rise, it becomes less competitive with corn for animal feed.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (7): Cost of growth on the environment - Social conditions may be about to improve 
text:  Sao Paulo city is an ill-fitting muddle of the developed and developing world. While all but the poorest houses have electricity and running water, less than half the city's domestic sewage is treated. Infant mortality and illiteracy are among the lowest in Brazil, but levels of violence and air pollution are among the highest. While the city's population growth has slowed considerably, at least 1m people still live in shanty towns, known as favelas, which dot the city's outskirts. This dichotomy has its roots in Sao Paulo's rapid growth over the past 50 years. Until the second world war, the city was a provincial centre grown rich on coffee profits. As industrialisation gathered pace, it attracted immigrants from poorer parts of Brazil, especially the north-east. Between 1940 and 1970 the city grew at about 5 per cent a year, from a population of 1.3m to 5.9m. Growth started to slow only in the 1980s, but not before the population had nearly doubled, reaching 9.5m in 1991. Industrial suburbs that were once separated from the city by green belts have merged into a single urban sprawl. If these suburbs are included, the population of the greater Sao Paulo metropolitan area is over 15m, making it the largest urban centre in South America. Sao Paulo's attraction has always been its economy. Until the beginning of the 1980s, industrial employment grew steadily and offered even semi-skilled immigrants the chance of relative prosperity. As Brazil's economic crisis struck in the 1980s, Sao Paulo's informal economy - ranging from armies of street sellers to gambling networks - provided a cushion against rising unemployment. Families have continued to arrive in the city over the past 10 years, although in much smaller numbers. Many still regard a poorly-paid job with a one-room apartment in Sao Paulo as preferable to staying in Brazil's rural areas. In the city, they have access to better services and opportunities for their children. Sao Paulo's rapid growth extracted a very high price from the city's environment. Urban growth was so rapid it overlooked the desirability of keeping 'buffer' areas undeveloped to improve leisure options and air quality. Extreme reliance on automobiles means air quality is usually poor. The city's main river, the Tiete, has become overburdened. Every day, it has to digest more than 1,000 tonnes of organic waste and about three tonnes of untreated inorganic waste, including chemicals and heavy metals; however, a state government clean-up is under way. There has also been a heavy social cost. The need to accelerate government spending on infrastructure and education has left other sectors underfunded. In the southern municipality of Diadema, which grew rapidly from the 1960s because it is close to Sao Paulo's car manufacturers, health centres are only now being installed. The public transport system has also failed to keep pace. Despite the city's size, its underground railway system is still restricted to three lines. In satellite cities around Sao Paulo, workers have to rely on buses and poor traffic conditions. Father Antonio Carlos Frizzo, of Guarulhos, near Sao Paulo's international airport, says that his parishioners spend three hours a day on buses getting to and from the city. The heavy strains imposed by such conditions are one reason for the growth of radical protestant churches. Social strains have also led to growing violence. In some poorer suburban regions, the murder rate is 90 per 10,000 inhabitants. However, there are areas of low violence, mainly in the centre. The city's overall murder rate is only slightly higher than New York's. Col Hermes Bittencourt Cruz, of the Sao Paulo police, links violence and other crime to the continuing process of urbanisation, poor education and one of the world's highest income disparities. 'Violence is a perverse result of disorganised development,' he says. Mr Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, of the centre for the study of violence at the University of Sao Paulo, complains of a lack of resources and skills in the judicial and police systems. In Sao Paulo there is one judge per 20,000 people, compared to one per 5,000 in Europe. Despite these challenges, Sao Paulo's rapid fall in population growth will allow better planning of infrastructure and services in the years ahead. Along with the rest of Brazil, Sao Paulo is also developing some institutions that are common to industrialised economies - from health and education networks in the shanty towns to environmental pressure groups. 'We have grave institutional problems, but our civil society has changed tremendously in the last 30 years,' Mr Pinheiro says.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (6): Instability holds back the markets  -Patrick McCurry on the progress of Latin America's financial capital 
text:  While decades of high inflation have turned Brazilians into some of the world's most creative financial managers, this instability has also held back the development of the capital markets and its principal financial centre, Sao Paulo. But things are changing. A more open economy, increasing foreign portfolio investment and the prospect of an end to high inflation could turn Sao Paulo into Latin America's chief financial capital. During the last decade Sao Paulo has consolidated its position as the heart of Brazil's financial system. Its stock market has a capitalisation of over Dollars 130bn, making it the biggest in South America. It has the developing world's largest futures market and is home to most of the national and international banks based in Brazil. Already this year many foreign investment banks and funds have opened offices in Sao Paulo, betting on an explosion in business as Brazil's big companies, most of which are based in the state, seek to finance expansion. 'Except for a handful of Brazilian banks still in Rio de Janeiro, all the big players have moved to Sao Paulo,' says Mr Jose Monforte, Citibank's director of capital markets in Brazil. This move began in the 1970s when Rio de Janeiro began to lose its position as the dominant financial centre. Sao Paulo's industrial strength, combined with aggressive targeting of new companies coming to market by the Sao Paulo stock exchange (Bovespa) were the main reasons for the change. Today, the Bovespa represents 90 per cent of the trading volume of Brazil's nine exchanges. It is hoping that, with stabilisation, it will recover its position as Latin America's biggest stock market from Mexico City. However, the Bovespa is a highly volatile market, lacking liquidity. Trading is concentrated in only a few shares and one company, the government-controlled telecom giant Telebras, accounts for about half the trading volume. Mr Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, Bovespa chairman, admits: 'We have an underdeveloped market.' Largely due to Brazil's economic problems, such as inflation of 2,500 per cent last year, there has been a fall in the number of listed companies and few capital issues in recent years. But a more stable economy combined with rising share values should increase the attraction of the stock market for firms seeking investment capital, Mr Vidigal believes. The concentration of trading in a handful of shares has been partly responsible for the volatility, according to Mr Julius Buchenrode, director of investments at Chase Manhattan in Sao Paulo. Investors have generally done well in the 1990s. The main Bovespa index more than doubled last year after falling slightly in 1992. The bullish trend looks likely to continue if the markets' preferred candidate, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, wins presidential elections this year. Much of the index appreciation has been due to the opening of the market to foreign institutional investors in 1991. They now account for about 20 per cent of average daily trading volume, which has soared from Dollars 34m in 1991 to Dollars 278m in the first half of this year and approached Dollars 500m in August. According to Mr Vidigal, volume could reach Dollars 700m to Dollars 800m if economic reforms continue. While equities have grown in importance due to foreign investment, Sao Paulo's local bond market has mostly stagnated. Brazil's problems have made raising capital through local debt issues extremely expensive for companies, which must pay interest rates of 25-30 per cent in real terms. Analysts say this market is likely to remain undeveloped in the short term as companies seek finance through equity issues. Stabilisation reforms could also boost Sao Paulo's futures and commodities exchange, which has grown to become the fifth largest in the world with a daily average of 350,000 contracts, although this growth is partly due to Brazil's economic instability. 'The market's growth is obviously related to companies trying to protect themselves against Brazil's inflation,' says Mr Marcos Eugenio da Silva, a University of Sao Paulo economist, referring to the fact that 60 per cent of the exchange's volume is in one-day interest rate futures. But a more stable economy with sustained growth would increase the exchange's business and lead to a lengthening of contract terms, he says. Mr Manoel Pires da Costa, the exchange chairman, says future development will depend on the ending of government restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, which make it difficult to increase links with foreign futures exchanges. As Brazil is one of the world's biggest exporters of coffee, soya and orange juice, Mr da Costa believes there is potential for attracting some of the trading in agricultural futures from exchanges in Chicago. But, according to Mr da Silva, such integration is 'wishful thinking' as it presupposes a stable and convertible currency, something Brazil still lacks. A traditionally weak currency has, however, allowed Brazil's commercial banks to make large profits. With inflation eroding the daily value of Brazil's currency, banks have been able to invest their clients' money that is held in current accounts, or the values of cheques being cleared, in the high-yielding money markets. Sao Paulo dominates the country's banking system. Twelve of the top 15 private sector banks, measured in terms of deposits, have their head offices there and the city's banks hold about half of all deposits in Brazil. The future for the banking system in a low-inflation environment is uncertain, especially for the less efficient state-owned banks. However, private sector banks will be able to expand on the back of increased banking charges and long-term consumer credit. Some larger state banks, including Sao Paulo's Banespa, will be able to rely on their asset bases and wide branch network. For foreign investment banks Sao Paulo has become a magnet. After the 1980s debt crisis, Brazilian companies have gradually returned to the international debt and equities markets and the country finally sealed its Brady plan debt deal earlier this year. Commissions and fees from companies issuing securities abroad, local issues and mergers and acquisitions could soon total Dollars 1bn a year, say market analysts. Longer term, optimists believe that Sao Paulo's role as Brazil's financial powerhouse will be extended with the growth of regional integration, particularly the Mercosul common market due to come into force at the beginning of next year. 'We are likely to see close links between Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires, including dual listings and the creation of a regional financial market,' says Mr Monforte of Citibank.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (3): Costs are cut as jobs are lost - Angus Foster looks at how industry has coped with economic crisis 
text:  According to the doomsters, Sao Paulo's industry is on a knife edge. After years of suffering from Brazil's economic crisis, companies have underinvested in technology and skills. They must catch up now, while the country's economy looks to be strengthening, or face rapid extinction from foreign competition. The situation is probably slightly more rosy, and certainly less simple, than the pessimists' predictions. Industry unquestionably has been damaged by the years of recession and economic 'shock' plans. Manufacturing industry averaged a 1.3 per cent annual decline in output in the seven years to 1992 and investment rates have fallen 10 percentage points to 15 per cent since the start of the last decade. But some sectors, including food processing, auto parts and wood products, have responded well. Industry as a whole has been forced to reduce its traditional reliance on government and look abroad for new export markets. Levels of productivity have risen sharply, although they will have to improve much further to match developed countries with which Brazil will increasingly have to compete. Mr Antonio Correa do Prado, economist at Sao Paulo's Dieese Institute, says the state's industry bears the scars of the last few years. Employment in industry is below 1986 levels. Companies laid off 500,000 workers during the 1990-1992 recession alone. 'Sao Paulo's industry has performed in a typically defensive way in order to survive rather than expand,' he says. Investment and new technology have been limited, and have mainly been used to improve management and planning processes. The use of computer technology in production, for example in design, has so far been limited probably because of cost, according to Mr Prado. Rather than invest, companies have spent the last few years trying to cut costs. The partial opening of Brazil's economy to imports in 1990, and the realisation of increased future competition, has forced many companies to restructure radically. The most visible result has been the drop in industrial employment. But most companies have improved efficiency in other areas too. It is a common refrain among businessmen that they are this year likely to produce more than in 1990 with only half the workforce. Duratex, a maker of hardboard and bathroom fixtures with eight factories in Sao Paulo, has reduced its headcount from 14,500 to 7,300 since 1990. It has also moved its head office into two buildings instead of seven and cut the delay on delivering orders to the US from 65 to 10 days. 'We realised we had to be competitive otherwise we would not survive,' says Mr Plinio Pinheiro, executive director. The rapid decline in industrial employment in Sao Paulo was seen as inevitable by companies' managements. But it has been fiercely criticised by union leaders. They say laid-off workers are being forced into service sector jobs which are often part-time and lower paid. Mr Vincente Paulo da Silva, president of Brazil's main trade union grouping CUT, says that unions agree Brazil has to integrate with the world economy and develop high technology industries. 'But this can only happen if workers participate. It cannot happen by throwing workers out onto the street,' he says. There have been some important agreements to retain labour in return for lower wage claims, such as the 1992 pact in the car industry. But industrial employment is likely to continue to fall in coming years, although at a reduced rate. New investment will be directed at technology, suggesting the state's economy will face a growing unemployment problem. There is greater consensus between management and labour on the speed of further opening to the world economy. Average tariffs have fallen from 30 to 14 per cent since 1990. Both sides believe further cuts should be cautious and that industry needs more time to prepare for foreign competition. Recent hints from the federal Ministry of Finance that import tariffs would be lowered in a bid to stimulate competition and lower domestic prices, have been broadly criticised. Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Federation of Sao Paulo Industries, believes the threats are bluff. 'You cannot just junk our industries, we cannot accept a total opening yet. No minister of finance can unilaterally open our markets by abolishing tariffs. For a start, our industrialists are very strong politically,' he says. The financial problems of the federal and state governments have accelerated the state's withdrawal from economic decisions, a process which is set to continue. Government remains an important client for many industrial sectors, but the time of cosy relationships is over. 'We are no longer waiting for the government, we have learned to survive without them,' says Mr Moreira Ferreira. One area where businessmen do want government action is the port of Santos in the south of Sao Paulo state. This is Brazil's most important, but has become expensive because of inefficient union practices. Mr Pinheiro says Duratex finds it cheaper to send its export products 1,000km by road to the state of Parana rather than use Santos. Unfortunately for the businessmen, Mr Mario Covas, Sao Paulo's probable next governor, has strong backing among the Santos port workers, and may not be ready to listen to the complaints.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (5): All the delights of the big city 
text:  Sometimes dubbed 'South America's New York' because of its dynamism, skyscrapers and mix of cultures, Sao Paulo is a monster of a city. While its sheer size and confusing layout often overwhelm, an energetic and friendly population combine with a lively nightlife to compensate, writes Patrick McCurry. There are nearly 10m people in the city and about 15m in the metropolitan region, making it one of the biggest cities in the world. It is also one of the most cosmopolitan, thanks to the influx of millions of immigrants earlier this century. There are descendants of Italians, Portuguese, East Europeans, Arabs and Jews and the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Recent decades have seen a big inflow of Brazilians in search of work, either from the state's interior or often from the poor north-east. Many of these ended up swelling the favela shanty towns dotted around the city. Orientation is a problem, both for newcomers and Paulistanos, as the city's inhabitants are known. Because of its rapid and unplanned growth, the lack of natural landmarks and a confusing road system, even locals get lost. Fortunately for foreigners there are plenty of taxis at all times of day. In addition, work and social life is often concentrated in relatively few areas. These include Avenida Paulista, which is the main financial centre, Jardins and Itaim Bibi. These are the districts where imported luxury cars are almost as common as locally made Fiat Unos and VW Golfs and where the flats are protected by 24-hour security guards. Some visitors find these areas a bit characterless but they are a symbol of Paulistanos' American-style obsession with modernity. Because the city grew so quickly during the state's post-war industrialisation old buildings, including the mansions of coffee barons, were torn down to make way for office and apartment blocks. Today, blocks of flats built in the 1950s are considered historic. The city's old centre, known as 'centro', gradually lost importance in the 1960s and 1970s as businesses moved out to areas like Paulista and later to suburbs like Santo Amaro in the south. Today the centre retains its character and liveliness but is avoided by many middle-class residents because of parking problems and worries about crime. Many Paulistanos like to contrast Sao Paulo with its rival Rio de Janeiro. Unlike Rio, they say, Sao Paulo is a 'serious' city where hard work is rewarded. Cariocas, as Rio residents are known, dismiss Paulistanos as uptight workaholics too busy to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Nevertheless, foreign visitors frequently find that Paulistanos, like most Brazilians, are genuinely friendly and helpful. In many ways Sao Paulo is trying to be an American city, or at least that seems to be the aspiration of many middle- class Paulistanos. A frequently unsatisfactory public transport system, worries about crime and the city's size have created a strong car culture. For example, instead of taking a taxi or public transport many wealthy (and not-so-wealthy) Paulistanos would rather drive to the busy Rua Franz Schubert, a chic back street housing some of the most ritzy night spots, and queue for 45 minutes to park. When they leave, they will wait another 45 minutes while the parking valet finds and recovers their car. Likewise, a popular evening out for middle-class families and adolescents is to drive to one of the city's shopping malls to eat, window shop, go to the cinema or just hang out. For many living in the enormous industrial suburbs outside the wealthy pockets of the city and for the million or so favela residents, however, entertainment is more likely to be centred on the local bar. Going out is one of the city's big attractions. Sao Paulo has a wide variety of restaurants thanks to its history of immigration, notably in the Japanese district of Liberdade and the nearby Italian neighbourhood of Bixiga. Paulistanos like to socialise late, often eating at 10pm, and then frequently carry on to a bar or jazz club until the early hours of the morning. The city is a leading South American centre for theatre, concerts and exhibitions. Many of Brazil's outstanding musicians regularly perform in Sao Paulo while international performers and orchestras put on shows at the city's opera house, the Olympia venue or open air concerts in Ibirapuera park. Top class football is another of Sao Paulo's leisure attractions. Despite losing many of their world cup stars to European teams, Sao Paulo FC, Palmeiras and Corinthians football clubs put on some of the best footballing shows in the world at city stadiums Morumbi and Pacaembu. To escape the pollution and stress of the city, residents need no encouragement to head for the coast, about two hours away. The main resorts are Guaruja, Ubatuba and Ilhabela. These are packed in the summer months, particularly at new year and Carnival. In the winter, many make tracks for the weekend retreat of Campos do Jordao in the mountains three hours away from the city. Useful telephone numbers: City code is 011. UK consulate: 287 7722.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (4): State looks to private sector stake in projects - Big changes in infrastructure planning may be needed 
text:  Attempts by the financially-troubled state of Sao Paulo to privatise or contract out public services have met with delays, legal constraints and opposition by the state government and its companies. But supporters of privatisation believe economic necessity will still force a radical change in infrastructure planning. They regard the state as ripe for development by private companies, sometimes in partnership with the public sector, and predict billions of dollars of private investment in projects over the coming decade. The belief stems from Sao Paulo's attraction as the wealthiest and most industrialised Brazilian state and the fact that the squeeze on public finances makes building new motorways, power plants and other infrastructure projects increasingly difficult for the state, which has a total debt of around Dollars 31bn and a budget deficit this year of 25 per cent. 'We are seeing a shift in the balance between public and private sector, with private companies being given more space,' says Mr Carlos Roberto Silvestrin, executive director of the Tiete-Parana Development Agency (ADTP) and a former commercial manager at Cesp, the state-controlled power generation company. The ADTP represents around 100 private and public sector companies interested in projects in the Tiete-Parana region. This includes six Brazilian states plus Paraguay and Bolivia, although projects are concentrated in the key market of Sao Paulo. The ADTP envisages development projects totalling Dollars 20bn by the end of the century, particularly in energy but also in motorways, railways and public sanitation. Much of the development is linked to plans for a gas pipeline between Bolivia and Sao Paulo. The pipeline plan foresees delivery of an initial 8m cubic metres of natural gas a day by 1997 to the Brazilian market, particularly Sao Paulo. But financing and final feasibility studies have still not been defined, although both sides hope to reach agreement by the middle of next year. Another important project is the opening to navigation of the Tiete and Parana rivers. Cesp, which draws hydro-electric power from both rivers, says it will complete the construction of locks along the waterway by the end of the year, making it navigable from the heart of Sao Paulo to the border with Paraguay and up to the Brazilian state of Goias. The ADTP believes the waterway will become a catalyst for development of light industry and will be helped by the Mercosul common market that starts on January 1. Private sector involvement will be especially important in energy projects, since Sao Paulo may encounter an 'energy deficit' by the end of the decade. Cesp estimates that it will need to increase its installed capacity, now about 10,000MW, by about 600MW a year to the end of the decade to cope with demand. 'It will be impossible for the public sector to pay for this expansion and the only alternative is to attract private investment,' says Mr Antonio Jose Zagatto, Cesp's planning and development manager. Although state-owned companies such as Cesp and the sanitation company Sabesp are involved in the ADTP venture, the state government's record in linking infrastructure projects to private investment has so far been disappointing, according to Mr Venilton Tadini, executive director of the Paulista Development Company. This was created in 1992 by Sao Paulo businessmen, with the support of the state government, to produce viability studies for public sector concessions. At the same time the state government passed a law allowing such concessions. 'We have worked on reports including prison privatisation and highway concessions but often very little has happened once we have sent them to the state,' says Mr Tadini, who blames opposition to privatisation among state officials and politicians. Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury, the state governor who leaves office at the end of the year, also blames internal opposition as well as the lack of a federal law on concessions. The only important result of Sao Paulo's 1992 law has been the beginning of tender processes for the concession of three stretches of motorway. Under these, private companies will be offered toll revenues for 20 or 25 years in return for maintaining the roads and building new stretches. As well as resistance to change among old guard officials, other factors that have so far restricted private involvement in infrastructure projects include Brazil's economic instability and high inflation, which last year hit 2,500 per cent, and the lack of a federal framework in areas such as private energy production. A federal government decree authorising independent power production (IPP) has been expected for months but so far not been issued. This measure is likely to allow private companies to build and operate power plants, selling the electricity to state-controlled distributors and, in special cases, directly to customers. Mr Joao Magalhaes president of the Brazilian subsidiary of US engineering company Bechtel, has been working on plans for an electricity station in Paulinia, Sao Paulo, for eight months, but says that uncertainties still include the lack of legislation and potential project finance problems. Brazil's lack of experience in non-recourse project finance, also known as 'stand alone' schemes, under which those undertaking to build a plant are not held liable by banks for delays or cost overruns, could prevent private and foreign companies taking on IPP schemes, says Mr Magalhaes. Under non-recourse financing, which was used for US independent power plants, banks make sure projects are watertight before giving loans. In Brazil projects often run into problems because loans are made for badly planned projects since the banks know they can recover their money from the building consortium whatever happens to the development of the project, he says. But in spite of the uncertainties Mr Magalhaes is convinced that sooner or later Sao Paulo will have to embrace private infrastructure projects such as IPP: 'The market is there, the big question is when it will all start happening. I just hope they don't wait until there's an energy crisis before taking action.' Mr Silvestrin, while accepting that progress in developing projects could have been quicker, argues a big change is occurring in Sao Paulo and Brazil as a whole. The country's current economic stabilisation plan and the probable election as president of Mr Cardoso, as well as the increasing interest being shown by private and foreign companies projects, are all evidence of this, he says. 'We have even signed a memorandum of understanding between the ADTP and Mr Ron Brown, the US secretary of commerce, which shows the interest in Sao Paulo's potential,' he says.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (2): A shift in the centre of gravity - The economy 
text:  Sao Paulo state remains the capitalist heart of Brazil. But its centre of gravity is gradually shifting from a traditional industrial base towards a diverse service economy responding to companies and consumers in what is easily the country's biggest market. The state's 32m people, about a fifth of Brazil's population, produce 37 per cent of national wealth and a third of the country's exports. Its industrial dominance was built on the state's coffee boom of the last century, which spurred a large influx of mainly European immigrants. Agricultural wealth combined with a growing and dynamic population fuelled industrialisation. This accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s with the arrival of multinational car, chemical and manufacturing companies, attracted by government attempts to spur Brazil's industrial growth. But today, like a heavyweight boxer who has spent too much time in the ring, Sao Paulo's industrial punch is gradually losing its power. Between 1980 and 1991 its economy averaged an annual growth rate of just 0.6 per cent compared to 1.4 per cent for Brazil as a whole, according to Seade, the state's research centre. Sao Paulo's share of national wealth in GDP terms fell from 41 to 37 per cent during the period. The state finance ministry puts Sao Paulo's gross domestic product at Dollars 215bn last year. But Brazil's economic statistics are often unreliable, and output was probably lower. The growth slowdown has been caused because other parts of Brazil, particularly Minas Gerais and Parana in the south-east, are catching up with Sao Paulo and attracting new industrial companies with cheap land, tax incentives and weaker unions. Many Paulistas, as the state's inhabitants are known, welcome the move from the often polluting industrial companies to a more services-based economy. Services increased their share of state domestic product from 50 to 58 per cent between 1980 and 1991 while industry fell from 47 to 38 per cent, according to Seade. Agriculture has also lost importance. From a dominant position in the 1940s, it now accounts for 3-4 per cent of domestic product, though the figure is higher if related industries such as food processing are included. Unemployment has increased from an average annual rate of 8 per cent during 1985-1989 to 12-15 per cent since 1990, according to non-government statistics which include underemployment. The official estimate of unemployment at 5.9 per cent in June is widely agreed to be too low. Job cuts are largely due to a general restructuring in Brazilian industry following the opening of the economy to international competition at the beginning of the decade. For example, the jewel in Sao Paulo's economic crown is the car industry, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of industrial production. Last year Sao Paulo produced more than two-thirds of Brazil's 1.4m vehicles but with fewer workers than in 1990 when around 900,000 vehicles were made. Meanwhile, General Motors' Brazilian subsidiary is expected to build a new plant for 100,000 vehicles a year outside the state, possibly in neighbouring Minas Gerais. The company decided not to expand its plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, because of poor labour relations, though some industry observers believe the financial incentives offered outside Sao Paulo were perhaps more important. Mr Carlos Azzoni, an economist at the University of Sao Paulo and a former planning official in the state government, says: 'Part of the problem has been that the state government has not been as aggressive as others in trying to attract companies.' However, the state government has been preoccupied with financial problems, which have made it difficult to find money to improve the state's infrastructure, traditionally one of Sao Paulo's biggest attractions for companies. Partnerships with the private sector are on the agenda but have so far made limited progress. Some large projects, such as an extension to the city's underground rail network and a clean-up of the river Tiete, are receiving support from multinational agencies. Mr Azzoni argues that improved transport and communications infrastructure in other states has allowed companies to move production out of Sao Paulo, but still retain access to its consumer market. '(Companies) will continue to keep their head offices in Sao Paulo but open new plants where it's cheaper,' he says. The move from industry to services has led to Sao Paulo evolving towards a 'qualitative not a quantitative importance,' says Mr Azzoni. Nowhere in Brazil is there such a concentration of universities, research centres and high tech companies. About 80 per cent of Brazil's scientific and technological research is carried out in Sao Paulo, according to Mr Pedro Paulo Branco, director of Seade. The success of Brazil's current stabilisation plan would give a big boost to Sao Paulo, according to Mr Branco, who says that because of its diverse economy, good infrastructure and well-trained workforce it can recover far more quickly than the national economy. Others believe stabilisation will provide only a short-term industrial turnaround and that Brazil's economic centre of gravity is inevitably dispersing to other regions. Similar doubts exist over the importance of the Mercosul free trade area for the state. Some believe Mercosul will mainly benefit states to the south of Sao Paulo, while others point to the development of a powerful economic axis linking South America's two biggest consumer markets: Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires. Whatever happens, Sao Paulo will still remain in the middle of a hugely important consumer market and industrial region, including Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais to its north and developed states like Parana and Rio Grande do Sul to its south.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (1): The priority now must be to spread wealth - Angus Foster considers the challenges and opportunities facing Brazil's economic heartland 
text:  It is sometimes tempting to imagine, sitting amid the opulence and consumerism of central Sao Paulo, that Brazil is a developed country. The city's rich are among Latin America's wealthiest and dine nightly at expensive European-style restaurants. Sao Paulo's companies make satellites, fighter aircraft and family saloon cars and are run by overseas-educated managers. In the city's commercial areas, portable telephones and computers are commonplace. So it may at times be hard to understand, amid the poverty and hardship of the city's many shanty towns, how such vicious contrasts in wealth and opportunity can exist so close to each other. In the shanty towns, some families go weeks without meat, spend half their monthly wages on transport to and from work, and have to save up to telephone relatives in other states. But these contrasts, the result of rapid urbanisation and one of the world's worst income disparities, are so common in Brazil that it is easy to become immune to their implications. For Sao Paulo, which has spent the last 50 years establishing itself as the country's economic and commercial centre, the urgent priority is to spread the wealth it is generating to a greater number of people. Sao Paulo state is about the size of the UK. It is home to 31m people, of which roughly half live in and around Sao Paulo city. The state accounts for just under 40 per cent of Brazil's output, suggesting Sao Paulo's economy is slightly larger than Turkey's but slightly smaller than Belgium's. Its companies are among the most dynamic in Latin America and nearly half Brazil's biggest 50 private companies have their head offices in the state. Its financial system has developed rapidly into the most important in South America. Sao Paulo is home to four of Brazil's five biggest private banks, and its stock exchange accounts for more than 90 per cent of trading in Brazilian shares. Together, Sao Paulo companies exported more than Dollars 13bn of goods and services in 1992, more than Argentina. Despite these impressive numbers, Sao Paulo has had a tough few years as Brazil's overall economic crisis mounted. Deep recession from 1990 to 1992 squeezed domestic sales. Falling import tariffs opened some sectors of the economy to foreign competition. Industry laid off more than 500,000 people during the period as companies tried to improve productivity and adjust to an economy slowly opening to the outside world. The improvement in the economy last year - Brazil saw real growth of 5 per cent - was significantly due to the car industry, one of Sao Paulo's most important. Helped by tax cuts and pent-up demand, the car industry reported its best year since the 1970s and production increased 30 per cent to 1.39m units. Industry also gained from an improvement in retail sales, and evidence that companies were starting to invest in expanding capacity. Both trends have accelerated this year following the launch in July of Brazil's new currency, the Real. This has led to a sharp drop in inflation from about 50 per cent a month to less than 5 per cent. If Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister who has the support of most businessmen, wins next month's presidential elections as expected, there is likely to be a further sharp increase in business confidence. His main opponent, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is opposed by business groups because of his union links and radical plans in areas like land reform. Whoever wins the election, the Real is the first rather than the final step in a programme to modernise Brazil's economy. The country's creaking tax and social security systems also need thorough reform. With the federal government facing a mounting budget deficit from next year, and claiming it cannot cut spending further, economic forecasting for even the short term is difficult. For Sao Paulo's state government, the situation is equally troubled. While net debt has risen to Dollars 31bn, of which part was inherited from the previous regime, the state's main source of income, state value added tax, has fallen from Dollars 11bn in 1989 to Dollars 9bn because of economic recession and companies moving to other states. These financial problems have seriously undermined the capability of the present government, under Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho. They are also likely to hamper his successor, who is due to take office in January following elections next month. The winner is expected to be Mr Mario Covas, a former senator for Sao Paulo and a close ally of Mr Cardoso. Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Sao Paulo Federation of Industries, says Mr Covas will 'suffer a lot. He will have to spend the first one and a half years recovering the government's finances. That's his priority,' he adds. But plenty of other priorities will land on Mr Covas's desk. Mr Vincent Paulo da Silva, president of the CUT union congress, says: 'State governments only act in the case of emergencies or for electoral reasons. What we need, instead, is a government which does much more in terms of building infrastructure and providing education.' Mr Pedro Jacobi, who studies urban problems at the private Cedec institute in Sao Paulo, says his research shows that people's biggest concerns are air quality, violence and the lack of health centres. 'What is worrying is that nearly 70 per cent of people said they expected the state to solve these problems, even though we are being told the state must shrink and is without the money,' he says. Given the speed of Sao Paulo city's growth as industrialisation gathers pace, taking the urban population from 1.3m in 1940 to 9.5m today, some of its achievements are impressive. Illiteracy, which in the 1950s extended to half the state's population, has fallen sharply to under 10 per cent of persons aged 10 or more. Sao Paulo is also one of only a few states in Brazil to have enough school places for all its children, although there are complaints about the quality and wages of its teachers. But the challenges now are in areas more associated with developed economies as well. Sao Paulo needs to create secure and well-paid jobs rather than continue to rely on an expanding informal economy. Environmental concerns are only starting to be addressed. Meanwhile, about 1m people still live in shanty towns, usually without adequate sewerage, and watch as the gap between rich and poor continues to widen. The poorest 50 per cent of Brazilians saw their share of national income fall from 15 to 12 per cent over last decade. They now earn less than the country's richest 1 per cent. 'What you see clearly is a level of social disintegration. It's a result of the lack of jobs, the effects of drugs in the slums and the extent of the social problems, and these have been increasing rapidly,' says Mr Jacobi.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts rise sharply on news of higher base rates 
text:  The surprise move by the UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke to raise UK base rates for the first time in almost five years prompted a rise of almost one point at the long end of the UK gilt market yesterday. The market had been falling on news of a higher than expected rise in August factory gate prices but changed tack following the news of the half-point rise in the base rate to 5 3/4 per cent. The change in sentiment caused gilts to outperform other European government bond markets. 'The gilt market loved it, especially given the firm comments on tax,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg. 'There had been some uncertainty about policy here and the market finds this very reassuring. I would be surprised if the market didn't move ahead in the next few days.' Mr John Shepperd at Yamaichi said: 'If we continue to get tight monetary and tight fiscal policy, this will leave the gilt market very well placed to outperform other European bond markets.' He added, however, that there was still the possibility of a further interest rate rise at the time of the November budget. Mr Michael Saunders at Salomon Brothers said the UK economy was likely to continue to accelerate, despite the rate rise, and forecast that the chancellor would increase rates by another 50 basis points within the next few months. 'This has strengthened his position in the markets,' he said. The yield spread between gilts and bunds narrowed from around 145 basis points on Friday to about 135 basis points yesterday. On Liffe, the December long gilt future rose to 100 1/32 in late trading, up  27/32 points on the day. The timing of the rise in UK base rates caused some nervousness in continental European bond markets because it came so hard on the heels of Friday's publication of US wholesale prices. The sharp increase in the August data had revived fears that the Federal Reserve would have to raise rates again soon to curb inflation. Most analysts said the UK move was another strong signal that no further interest rate cuts in Europe were likely. 'The UK rate rise confirms that the interest rate cycle has turned in Europe,' said Mr Andrew Bevan, international bond economist at Goldman Sachs. Immediately after the UK rate rise, the market started speculating that Denmark would be the next country to tighten, which prompted the Danish central bank to make an official denial that it was considering such a move. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, still believed that Germany would cut rates by a half-point before the end of the year. 'There is no reason for the Bundesbank to raise rates until the end of next year,' he said. He added that there was no history of the Bundesbank using rate rises as pre-emptive strikes against inflation. The Bundesbank is due to hold its regular meeting on Thursday but is not expected to announce interest rate changes. It is also likely to stick with a fixed-rate repo. 'The Bundesbank wants to give a clear indication that things are on hold,' said Mr Bevan. On Liffe, the December bund future rose 0.25 points to 88.96 in moderate trading. US Treasury bond prices dipped yesterday as traders braced themselves for today's reading on consumer price inflation. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/32 at 97 1/2 , with the yield rising to 7.708 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  1/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.334 per cent. In the early hours of trading an uneasy calm prevailed as dealers squared up their positions before the release of the August consumer price index this morning. Despite a generally negative tone, prices on the long end of the yield curve started out a little firmer, in a corrective move that followed Friday's huge sell-off. However, the session was dominated by fears of inflation, which surfaced last Friday on news of a 0.6 per cent jump in August producer prices, compared with expectations of a 0.4 per cent rise, and bonds across the board soon succumbed to the pessimism. The market was concerned that the CPI would replicate the inflationary trend in producer prices. Before the release of the PPI, a 0.4 per cent gain in August consumer prices was forecast. Analysts said it is likely that the intermediate and long-dated segments of the maturity range will tumble again if the figure exceeds that level, though a weaker than expected result could bring temporary relief. Any improvement might prove short-lived, however. The market is facing a barrage of economic reports later in the week, including data on retail sales figures, industrial production and capacity utilisation. Most observers still believe the Federal Reserve will delay its next move to tighter credit conditions until November, despite the bad news on inflation, but there are signs that confidence in that scenario is eroding. This week's data should either confirm the consensus view or undermine it.

The exchange will also give priority to regional stockbrokers who want to take an equity interest in local firms, or who want to set up in Singapore as an international member of the exchange, Mr Hu said at the Asian Securities Analysts Council annual conference. Mr Hu told the conference the Singapore government wanted the SES to develop as a centre for regional securities trading, and these measures would increase liquidity as well as improve the exchange's competitiveness. 'The SES will allow foreign brokers, who are not members of the exchange, but which are licensed by the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), to become subscribers to the trading terminals provided by the SES to deal in stocks quoted in foreign currencies,' Mr Hu said. Foreign brokerages will no longer have to put such transactions through an SES member broker.

text:  The World Bank has delayed its much-anticipated Dollars 1.5bn global offering until next week due to current market volatility and holidays in Japan and the US, joint lead manager UBS said yesterday. Syndicate managers were expecting the Bank to tap the five to 10-year area of the dollar sector this week. 'They are looking at the long end of the market and with current market volatility this is an awkward time to do it,' said one syndicate manager. Strong US producer price figures released on Friday have increased bond market nervousness about US consumer price data due today, UBS said. 'With less data next week, we will get the focus of the market,' said one UBS official. Elsewhere in the eurobond market, activity remained subdued, with investors nervous following the rise in UK base rates and ahead of the key US CPI data today. The Dollars 500m offering by Metropolis of Tokyo of 10-year eurobonds suffered from weakness in the dollar sector, syndicate managers said. 'Markets are nervous and investors are holding back their purchases,' said one syndicate manager. 'As a result, the offering has suffered a bit.' The bonds, priced to yield 32 basis points over US government bonds, were targeted mainly at Japanese institutional investors, lead manager IBJ said. Syndicate managers described the pricing as tight; the spread widened to 35 basis points after the bonds had broken syndicate. 'The spread should have been wider but most of the paper will clear at the 34-35 level,' said one manager. Market sources said the proceeds from the offering were swapped back into yen. France Telecom launched its first eurobond outside the French and Swiss franc sectors with a L150bn issue of three-year bonds. Lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation reported strong demand from retail investors in the Swiss and Benelux areas and some French institutional interest. 'The lira market is currently very retail-driven and offers tremendous arbitrage,' said one manager. Dresdner Bank launched a FFr2bn offering of four-year bonds, priced to yield 18 basis points over French government bonds.

text:  Lufthansa, the German national airline, yesterday set a subscription price of DM160 each for its 7.64m new ordinary shares, in line with market expectations. Lufthansa's shares closed at DM200 yesterday, up DM3 from Friday. The airline will raise around DM1.2bn by offering shareholders one new share for every four held. The new shares will be provided with full dividend rights for the 1994 business year. Last month Lufthansa said it expected to make an operating profit this year and confirmed earlier suggestions that it would resume dividend payments for the first time since 1989. The German government will not be participating in the rights issue, thereby reducing its stake in Lufthansa from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent. The 3.9m shares which the government will not be taking up will be sold to investors at home and abroad, excluding the US, via a syndicate of international banks led by Dresdner Bank. If demand is sufficiently buoyant, the government also intends to sell 2.1m existing shares which would further reduce its stake to around 36 per cent. The price of these shares will be set on September 29. They are expected to be priced at a small discount to the prevailing market price. The subscription period for the new shares will run from September 20 to October 4. As a result of the rights issue, the airline's ordinary share capital will increase by a nominal DM382m to DM1.9bn. At the annual meeting in July, Lufthansa's shareholders authorised the executive board to increase the company's capital by a nominal DM515m. 'With the consent of the supervisory board, the executive board has now made partial use of this authorisation,' Lufthansa said. Another rights issue is expected to take place next year.

headline:  FT  13 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Europe faces Ecu225m bank charge - The cost may be only one of many disruptions caused by a move to monetary union 
text:  The possibility that a move to European monetary union (Emu) could cost large European banks up to Ecu225m (Dollars 278m) each is the most daunting conclusion of research carried out by the Ecu Banking Association. But the cost is only one of many disruptions faced by banks moving to Emu. As the study points out, the effect on banks of moving to monetary union is comparable to large scale deregulation. It will involve massive technical changes, elimination of some markets and the growth of others, and large changes to banks' funding methods and strategy for European operations. Furthermore, banks in the core group of European countries that move to monetary union by the turn of the century may be in a better position than those outside. Exclusion from Emu could raise funding costs, lower credit ratings and form a large hurdle to operating efficiency. Given this large list of obstacles, it appears surprising at first that bankers involved in the study group should have emphasised their enthusiasm for the idea yesterday. But the report concludes that banks could gain comparative advantage by embracing the idea quickly and comprehensively. A move to monetary union could challenge traditional methods of banking in Europe in a number of ways: Foreign exchange trading among different European countries will disappear, wiping out an important source of income not only from cash markets but also sales of financial derivatives to hedge currency risks. In their place will be put a larger market for exchange of Ecu with dollars and yen. Correspondent banking - in which banks have partners in other countries to perform payment transactions in local currency - will be replaced by bilateral or multilateral payment arrangements in Ecu. This could affect traditional profits from fees, and 'float' income on cash sums. Local money markets, bond markets and credit markets, which are supported by local payment and settlement services will be replaced by an Emu-sized market, bound by one currency. This will change the scale at which many banks operate, forcing them to re-define operations. Retail banks will have to re-state historical data on customer accounts in Ecu after monetary union, as well as altering technology and producing new transfer forms and cheque books. They will also have to make big changes to comply with alterations in clearing systems. The transition costs will be higher if governments avoid a 'big bang' approach in which currencies within monetary union disappear - perhaps over a weekend. If they choose to allow a 'dual currency' system with local currencies running alongside the Ecu for a time, costs would be higher. Bankers yesterday pointed out that costs of transition could vary considerably depending on the legislative approach. For example, if European legislation allows all outstanding loans to be re-stated in Ecu rather than being individually re-negotiated, it avoids large one-off costs. Yet the banks within monetary union will at least be able to comfort themselves that most costs are transitional, and that they may be able to exert a competitive advantage on outsiders after union. The most worrying fate faces banks whose currency is excluded from the union. A study of the impact on banks in countries outside Emu, prepared by Mr Jaun Moro of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, argues that such banks will suffer competitive disadvantage in lacking a stable Ecu funding base. This will compress their margins if they lend at similar spreads to Emu-based banks. Mr Moro argued that banks from non-integrated countries risk being downgraded by credit rating agencies because they are exposed to 'second tier currencies'. They will also have to use 'massive amounts of hard currency' as an alternative to their domestic currency, so raising their costs. This could have considerable implications for large banks in countries such as the UK, Ireland and Denmark which could be left behind in the initial move to monetary union. UK banks with large cross-border businesses, such as NatWest and Barclays, could be severely affected. Mr Olivier Mas, chairman of the association, emphasised that banks are likely to be impelled to start thinking of the Ecu area as their domestic market. This is likely to lead to a re-consideration of cross-border partnerships, particularly on payment systems. As Mr Mas said, London is the leading centre for Ecu clearing in Europe despite the UK government's attitude to monetary union. Yet UK banks could face difficulties in maintaining their grip on Ecu clearing and financial markets if they were operating sterling as a dual currency. This could lead to Emu changing the balance of power among banks that want to be forces in Europe. Those from non-Emu countries would have to fight harder against those which would gain funding advantages, and the backing of the hardest currency.

text:  A consortium led by Hellmann &amp; Friedman Capital Partners, a US investment banking firm, is to buy the cinema interests of the privately-owned Hoyts entertainments company, which has theatres in Australia, New Zealand and the US. No purchase price for the Australian group, owned by the Melbourne-based Fink family, has been revealed, although a spokesman for the US firm suggested it might be as high as ADollars 500m (USDollars 372m). The sale supersedes plans to float the Hoyts business on the stock market. These were announced in June, when Hoyts indicated that it was hoping to raise about ADollars 400m. At the time, Mr David Clarke, the company's chairman, suggested that the group might consider expansion into south-east Asia, particularly China. South America, and the Mexican market in particular, could also offer new opportunities, he added. In a statement yesterday, Hellmann &amp; Friedman indicated that it supported this assessment: 'A well-capitalised Hoyts has exciting expansion opportunities in its existing markets as well as in Asia and Latin America,' it said. Hoyts claims to be the 10th largest US cinema operator, with 79 cinemas  - mainly on the east coast - and 519 screens. In Australia, it is the third largest operator, taking about a quarter of the country's box-office receipts. The Fink family has owned Hoyts since 1985, and had planned to retain a small interest. At the time of the flotation announcement, Hoyts' pre-tax earnings were forecast at some ADollars 63m in the 1994 financial year.

The company said that no restructuring charges are planned. GM Hughes, which announced in March that it was preparing to combine its electronics and defence operations in a newly-formed Hughes Aerospace and Electronics subsidiary, said the cuts were essential in the face of declining defence spending. 'Today, the Department of Defense and our foreign customers are even more cost-driven and Hughes must change to meet those new priorities,' said Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of GM Hughes Electronics. The aerospace and defence, missile systems and systems sectors of Hughes Aircraft, which currently has 51,000 employees, will be combined with the Delco Systems operations of the Delco Electronics unit of GM Hughes. Last year these businesses together accounted for nearly Dollars 7bn of GMHE's Dollars 13.5bn revenues. The new company will have its headquarters in Washington, DC. The plan calls for about 3m sq ft of office and manufacturing space to be vacated in the next 18 months, with Hughes phasing out its 286-acre complex in Fullerton and offering the property for sale. Operations will transfer to other facilities and the systems sector activities in Fullerton will be consolidated in local leased facilities. 'We intend to make this new company a growth company through prudent acquisitions, intelligent investment in new product development and changes in our cost structure and approach to business,' Mr Michael Smith, who has been named chairman of Hughes Aerospace and Electronics, said.

In a statement to the stock exchange yesterday, Coles said it had received almost 12,000 proxies, covering more than one-fifth of its shares. It said these were overwhelmingly in favour of the deal. Coles, which is due to release its profit figures today, added that 'the company's chairman and chief executive officer have recently visited many of the major institutional shareholders . . . and the response to the proposed transaction . . . has been consistently and overwhelmingly supportive and affirmative'. The deal comprises a direct buy-back and cancellation of just under half the Kmart stake, and the possible purchase of a Kmart subsidiary which holds the remaining 11.45 per cent, with the method of disposal for these shares yet to be decided. A meeting to approve the deal has been called for September 19. However, Coles' task of persuading shareholders to back the deal has not been made easier by its falling share price, which closed down another 12 cents at ADollars 3.98 yesterday, compared with the ADollars 4.55 at which the Kmart interests would be bought in. Conversely, the fact that directors and associates own or control around 28 per cent of the equity could be to Coles' advantage.

text:  Telstra, the state-owned Australian telecommunications group which is known as Telecom in its own country, made a profit of ADollars 1.7bn (USDollars 1.3bn) in the year to end-June, a sharp increase on the ADollars 904.8m of the previous 12 months, and a record for any Australian corporation. Revenues were 5.6 per cent higher at ADollars 13.4bn. Part of the improvement was due to a reduction in abnormal items - down to ADollars 277.4m from almost ADollars 500m, and a fall in interest charges to ADollars 748m from ADollars 921m a year ago. However, Telstra also said that earnings before interest and tax had increased by 13.2 per cent, in spite of increasing competition as the Australian telecommunications market is opened up and Telstra's monopoly dismantled. The return on equity, before abnormals, was 18.3 per cent, 'in line with other successful world telecommunications companies'. In spite of the figures, Mr Frank Blount, Telstra's American chief executive, made clear that he expected competition to intensify and indicated that the group - much criticised in the past for its poor service levels - had further to go in reaching the highest international standards. 'We are not there yet, and we cannot afford to relax for a moment,' he said. He declined to be drawn on the debate about the possible privatisation of Telstra. 'It's a matter for the shareholder,' he said, noting that the federal government has said that such a move 'is not on the agenda in the term of this government'. However, Mr Blount said he welcomed last week's final break-up of the 'PMT' consortium - the alliance of Telecom, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Kerry Packer  -which was formed to pursue pay-TV opportunities in Australia. This freed Telstra to pursue other alliances, he indicated. 'We're talking to other programming and content people and services providers. We have discussions going with at two or three parties in Australia and some that are not in Australia,' he said.

There was a small operating profit before abnormals and tax of ADollars 4.29m, down from ADollars 15.1m previously. Dominion was loss-making in the second half, which the company said was due to 'insufficient operating margins' at the Cosmo Howley and Bannockburn gold mines, and high amortisation charges here, reflecting short mine lives. The bottom-line loss for the year also reflects a ADollars 56.9m abnormal charge, which includes a ADollars 29.3m write-down of gold operations and a ADollars 17.8m write-off of capitalisation exploration expenditure. GIO Australia, which was privatised by the New South Wales government and is one of Australia's largest general insurers, reported after-tax profits of ADollars 126.1m for the year to end-June, up by 22.3 per cent, writes Nikki Tait. The result, however, was aided by a reduced tax charge, and operating profit before tax rose more modestly from ADollars 157.1m to ADollars 163.2m.

text:  Sparks are certain to fly at a shareholders' meeting, scheduled for today, of McCain Foods, at which members of New Brunswick's feuding McCain family are due to take important decisions on the future of the multinational frozen foods maker. Family members are expected to vote on a proposal to oust Mr Wallace McCain as joint chief executive, leaving his older brother Harrison as sole chief executive pending the appointment of an outsider to head the company. The two brothers would continue as non-executive chairman and deputy chairman. Wallace has strongly resisted the move. He has proposed that the McCain family should instead spin off part of the company to the public, and that he and Harrison should step down at the same time. Wallace yesterday asked a New Brunswick court to endorse his strategy. The outcome of the shareholders' meeting depends on these court proceedings. Although McCain is a private company, members of the family have increasingly vented their anger through public court documents, press releases and leaked letters. Wallace alleged in an affidavit submitted to yesterday's court hearing that none of the second-generation family members who comprise the board of McCain Foods holding company has 'the character, ability, business experience, judgment or acumen to direct and manage (its) affairs.' He alleged that McCain's extensive UK and European activities, which are under Harrison's control, are performing poorly, compared to the North American and Australasian operations, which are under his own control. According to the affidavit, the European businesses suffered a loss in July 'for the first time in many years'. One leaked document has revealed that McCain posted profits of CDollars 84.3m (USDollars 61.6m) last year on worldwide sales of CDollars 2.7bn. But Mr Harrison McCain said in a memo to employees last week that 'all the shareholders, except Wallace's family, think that Wallace and I . . . should make way for a new, independent CEO who will run the company professionally.' Wallace, Harrison and their respective families each own one third of McCain Foods, with the remaining third split between the children of their two deceased brothers. One issue that has arisen in the search for an outside chief executive is whether the newcomer will be willing to keep McCain's head office in the picturesque hamlet of Florenceville, New Brunswick, where Harrison and Wallace McCain built their first potato processing plant in 1956. Harrison McCain stressed the importance of finding the best candidates, 'not just the ones who agree with restrictions imposed on them beforehand'. He indicated that his opposition to taking the company public was partly based on a fear that control might eventually pass to faraway institutional shareholders with little interest in maintaining links with Florenceville.

Banco Comercial Portugues, whose hostile bid for Portugal's second largest bank has been vetoed by the government, is the most prominent loser. But little glory has attached to the other main forces in the struggle. BCP, which has earned a reputation for almost flawless management since it was founded in 1985, will suffer for its political misjudgement. The government has sullied its pro-market credentials.

Portugal's capital markets will not benefit from the badly-needed boost expected from BCP's Es132bn (Dollars 838m) offer for 40 per cent of BPA. In addition, traders fear the international image of the Lisbon market may have been damaged by the six-week process that culminated with a government decision to block the bid. BPA shareholders have been the first to suffer. Shares fell to Es2,260 at the close yesterday, the first day of trading since they were suspended by the CMVM on August 10. After BCP announced its offer of Es3,000 a share on July 26, the shares had climbed 31.8 per cent to Es2,650 before they were suspended out of concern that a disorderly market could develop. BCP shares also closed at Es2,260 yesterday, down 1.74 points from Friday. Lisbon dealers said the CMVM's long suspension of BPA shares had prevented small shareholders from taking advantage of their first opportunity for making gains since the bank began to be privatised in 1990. They fear the bid has shown Portugal's capital markets to be burdened with an overly bureaucratic regulatory framework that could deter foreign investors. BCP was putting on a brave face yesterday. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, chairman, said the bank's determination to expand remained unaltered. But it is not clear where he will look next. The government decision has left BCP, Portugal's fifth largest bank, still straining at the leash. Unable to build a market share consonant with its strong capital accumulation through organic growth alone, it has been trying to expand by acquisition. But the finance ministry has so far blocked its every move. In January, the government rejected BCP's bid for Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor, the sixth-ranked bank, as too low. A second attempt to privatise BPSM will be made later this year. But Mr Jardim Goncalves said yesterday BCP was no longer interested. BCP control of BPA would have increased its market share from 9.5 per cent to 24 per cent in a single blow. BCP will now have to resign itself to more gradual expansion, either by redirecting its sights on smaller takeover targets or by starting a new banking operation, its eighth, from scratch. The expansion envisaged by BCP is of the kind often promoted by the centre-right government of prime minister Anbal Cavaco Silva, who regularly expresses support for the building of strong Portuguese companies able to compete at a European level. The government's decision that a BCP takeover of BPA could destabilise the financial system has drawn strong criticism from a majority of Lisbon analysts and opposition parties. They say the veto is an unwelcome interference in the free operation of the market and a brake on the capacity of Portuguese banks to gain critical mass. The government's other main argument is that BCP's planned acquisition would have perturbed the privatisation strategy mapped out for BPA. The state still owns 24.5 per cent. BPA's core shareholders, a group of 13 Portuguese companies that owns 28.7 per cent, say the government has made an unwritten commitment to keep them in control after the final stage of privatisation, for which no date has been set. Praise may be due to the government for keeping faith with the core shareholders and sticking to a pledge to disperse BPA's capital widely among small investors. But BCP's bid has indicated the uncertainties to which the protracted privatisation of BPA and other banks has exposed Portugal's financial system. Rival bids from BCP and BPA's main shareholders for the remaining state holding would also have almost certainly increased the value of the stake. BPA's management has the most reasons to toast the government decision. It has survived - but far from unscathed. BCP's offer has shown the management team of Mr Joao Oliveira, chairman, to have been slow in implementing a strategic restructuring of the bank. BCP supporters claim the core shareholders tolerated relatively passive management in return for favourable treatment. Whether or not this is true, the core shareholders will now press hard for more aggressive management. They are expected to nominate eight non-executive board members at an extraordinary meeting on October 6, when the board will be expanded from seven to 15 members. The core shareholders are not currently represented.

text:  United Healthcare, one of the largest managed healthcare companies in the US, announced a Dollars 520m cash deal yesterday, the latest in a series of acquisitions aimed at expanding into new markets across the country. United has agreed to buy GenCare Health Systems, which operates in St Louis, Missouri, with revenues last year of Dollars 197m. The purchase is being made with part of the Dollars 2.3bn United received from the sale of its pharmacy benefit management company, Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, to SmithKline Beecham earlier this year. The company made clear at the time that it planned to use the money to continue buying regional healthcare companies. At the end of June, United had Dollars 2.6bn of cash and securities, giving it the resources to accelerate its acquisition programme. Earlier this year it made two all-stock acquisitions, worth around Dollars 900m at yesterday's market price. GenCare operates managed healthcare programmes in St Louis, including health maintenance organisations, with 194,000 members; preferred provider organisations, with 98,000 members; a workers' compensation plan covering 41,000 people; and a dental programme with 31,400. The consolidation of the managed care industry is rapidly throwing up a small number of big companies with the power to negotiate lower prices from hospital groups, drugs companies and other healthcare providers. GenCare's shares closed up Dollars 6 1/2 at Dollars 46, while United Healthcare's shares slipped by Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 53.

text:  Kimberly-Clark, the US paper group best known for its branded tissue products, plans to dispose of its pulp and newsprint businesses. Analysts said the potential sale or spin-off of the commodity operations could raise as much as Dollars 700m. The company is evaluating the options for divesting a pulp mill in Terrace Bay, Ontario, and its pulp and newsprint mill in Coosa Pines, Alabama. It said it was considering both a sale and an initial public stock offering. Kimberly-Clark's pulp and paper operations supply the company with its raw paper materials. They have been sluggish performers during a prolonged recession in pulp and paper prices, but the pulp and newsprint markets have seen a sharp price rebound. The sale of the Coosa and Terrace Bay operations would enable Kimberly-Clark to focus on global expansion of its consumer products businesses. It is a strong competitor to Procter &amp; Gamble for branded personal paper products in the US, but has a smaller overseas presence. Last year the company formed new subsidiaries or joint ventures to manufacture and market consumer products in Argentina, Venezuela, China, Indonesia, India and the Middle East.

text:  Prince Al-Waleed, the Saudi financier who earlier this year rode to the rescue of the ailing Euro Disney leisure group in its emergency financial restructuring, has emerged with a 9.65 per cent stake in the company. The prince is expected to augment this holding, which is owned by United Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB), one of his main investment vehicles, by triggering agreements to buy additional Euro Disney shares from Walt Disney, its US parent, and Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the state-controlled French financial institution. Prince Al-Waleed, a member of the Saudi royal family and one of the Middle East's most aggressive investors, stunned the stock market in early June by unveiling plans to acquire up to 24.63 per cent of Euro Disney. He undertook to buy any shares left on the market after the FFr6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) rights issue which was a vital component of the restructuring. Ironically, the prince's arrival boosted investor confidence and the rights issue was more heavily subscribed than many observers had expected. As a result, Prince Al-Waleed is likely to raise his stake through his agreements to buy additional shares from Walt Disney and the Caisse. He can acquire up to 5.22 per cent of Euro Disney from the Caisse at the rights issue price of FFr10.00 per share, and is also able to buy more shares from Walt Disney, to take the USCB stake up to its 24.63 per cent ceiling. Euro Disney is struggling to improve its performance, and there has been speculation that attendance levels at the EuroDisneyland theme park have been poor in the current financial year.

text:  The Castle Energy group of companies has completed the first of two steps in its settlement with Germany's troubled Metallgesellschaft group in a complex series of contracts between them, Reuter reports from Radnor, Pennsylvania. The US group said Metallgesellschaft had transferred 3.6m of its Castle Energy shares to Castle Energy, leaving it with about 1m shares (of about 7.6m shares issued and outstanding). In payment for the shares, Castle Energy has transferred to Metallgesellschaft certain participations it holds in debt to Metallgesellschaft. In the second step, Metallgesellschaft will cancel some Castle Energy debt obligations and assume some of its third party debt, together totalling about Dollars 375m. Metallgesellschaft will also transfer its remaining 1m Castle Energy shares, a Dollars 5.5m debenture convertible into 500,000 shares, and Castle Energy warrants that it holds. Castle Energy will retain its natural gas business, free of any interests of Metallgesellschaft. Finally, Metallgesellschaft will issue to Castle Energy a Dollars l0m interest-bearing note payable in three years. Castle Energy will also cancel Metallgesellschaft obligations under agreements effective from February 1995. Metallgesellschaft will continue to provide working capital to Castle Energy for the operation of its two oil refineries until March 31 1995. The first step of the restructuring was consented to by Metallgesellschaft's banks. The second step remains subject to the banks' approval, as well as certain other conditions, the company said.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Waging war over bread and baked beans: Neil Buckley on superstores' change of direction in their battle against the discounters 
text:  Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J Sainsbury, broke something of a taboo in the food retailing industry on Tuesday by admitting that big food retailers in the 1980s had allowed the prices of basic commodities to 'drift upwards'. Superstore chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, owned by Argyll, have always strenuously denied accusations that they 'overcharged' customers, allowing them to make 'excessive' profits in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The accusations resulted largely from the fact that the retailers' operating profit margins at up to 8 per cent were three or four times those of continental European food retailers. But superstores did not achieve such margins by putting a few pence on a packet of sugar or a carton of milk. They achieved them partly by expanding their ranges to include a far bigger proportion of high-margin goods such as own-label products, fresh, chilled, and ready-prepared foods - the creme frache, guavas and microwaveable lasagne that have transformed the nation's eating habits. At the same time retailers reduced costs by exploiting the economies of scale of larger stores, centralising their distribution through large regional warehouses and investing in check-out scanning and powerful computer systems. However, as Mr Sainsbury told the annual convention of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, the industry body funded by retailers and manufacturers, allowing basic food prices to creep up opened a gap in the market for cut-price discounters such as Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto, which have expanded in the UK since 1990. His comments help explain the so-called 'price war' in the grocery market in the past year. While there have been promotions on other products, superstores have focused on cutting prices on basic goods in an effort to squeeze out the discounters. That such a war has been waging in certain product areas is beyond doubt. Cans of baked beans are selling for 4p in discount chains in some regions, and loaves of white bread for 9p. The competition has taken its toll - Shoprite, the discount chain operating mainly in Scotland, has issued two profit warnings and expects only to break even at operating profit level this year. While skirmishing on basic food prices goes on superstore groups are continuing to emphasise their 'added-value', ranging from choice and quality to big car parks and baby-changing facilities. Moreover, by continually adding higher-margin products and services, superstore groups are effectively limiting the damage done to overall gross profit margins by price competition on basics. Tesco last month said its gross margin in the latest half-year had recovered to 0.1 percentage points below a year earlier, compared with 0.7 points in the previous half-year - thanks partly to its introduction of clothing and leisure goods into stores. That ability to protect margins enabled Mr Sainsbury, with Mr David Reid, finance director of Tesco, and Mr Colin Smith, chief executive of Argyll, to tell the IGD convention that in spite of the short-term pressures on grocery retailers, the long-term outlook was bright for the big groups. All admitted that new superstore sites were dwindling and it was becoming more difficult to get planning consent for out-of-town stores following publication of new government guidelines last year. But they suggested superstores were moving from their 'expansion' stage to 'maturity'. The way forward, Mr Smith suggested, was to keep on improving product ranges, cutting costs and raising the performance of existing stores - emulating the example of Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer. M&amp;S has increased profits in recent years with limited physical expansion in the UK. Moreover, with planning restrictions closing in, the fact that big grocers invested heavily in prime sites in the past decade left them in a dominant position in the market. Mr Reid said: 'I have no doubt that in 10 years' time we will be able to look back and see that superstores proved to be excellent long-term investments in a continually changing market.' But the big groups are finding new routes for expansion. Mr Sainsbury suggested they had been too eager to leave the high streets, where there was still business to be done, and where the retailers' new-found skills and efficiency enabled them to earn acceptable returns. Both Sainsbury and Tesco have opened revamped town-centre formats, called Central and Metro respectively. Mr Smith of Argyll also spoke of the need to 're-energise city centre stores and services'. Having conquered the edge-of-town areas, the big food retailing groups may start to reconquer the high streets.

text:  Mr Alan Quinn, a senior member of the Transport and General Workers union executive from Merseyside, has resigned on grounds of ill health as an internal inquiry starts into alleged fraud in the area's divisional office. No charges of wrong-doing are to be made by the executive against Mr Quinn. A TGWU spokesman confirmed last night that Mr Quinn, 40, had stepped down after more than 10 years as the Merseyside executive member. Mr Quinn said he was 'very sad' that he had felt it necessary to leave the executive, but added he had done so on doctor's orders. Mr Quinn was regarded as a highly influential figure on the left-dominated executive, playing an important role in determining union strategy. His position in the union was believed to have become increasingly untenable, however, after it was alleged that he had received Pounds 15,181 in expenses from the TGWU for his executive work last year. The money was to cover loss of earnings, mainly for attendance at meetings in London. The union's rules entitle an executive member to claim only Pounds 32 a day for loss of earnings. Mr Quinn's expenses were far higher than those of any other person on the executive and more than an official could have received if he had spent every day of the year on union business. Mr Quinn said yesterday that the figure for his expenses claim was 'inaccurate and not true'. He added that the TGWU's financial officer had accepted this. The election for his successor on Merseyside will take place soon.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Companies to sponsor 'vocational A-levels' 
text:  About 120,000 students in schools and further education colleges will be able to take corporately sponsored vocational qualifications from January. Fifteen companies, including American Express, United Biscuits, McDonald's, and J. Sainsbury, are offering sponsorship for General National Vocational Qualifications, the government announced yesterday. The qualifications are intended as a vocational alternative to A-levels to be taken by 18-year-olds. A pilot scheme introducing GNVQs was completed earlier this year. The companies' contributions range from providing projects and work experience to job offers if students reach the right standard. Prizes and travel bursaries are also on offer for students with the best results. About 250,000 students are enrolled for the qualifications, and up to half of these should be eligible to benefit from the sponsorships in some form - although most will not qualify for direct financial aid. For example, students taking a GNVQ in leisure and tourism will be allowed to take up the American Express sponsorship, which offers work experience with local businesses. Laing, the construction company, is offering similar support for the construction and built environment GNVQ, with guarantees of work and project experience for all students taking the course across the UK. Announcing the scheme, Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, said the government wanted a quarter of 16-year-olds to be enrolling for the qualifications by autumn 1996. He said GNVQs could not succeed 'without the active support, encouragement and involvement of employers'. Mr Mike Heron, chairman of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, said the scheme would ensure that the qualifications would be relevant to business needs. The government believes its 'vocational A-levels' will be recognised as a passport to employment since in theory they provide a middle path between academic A-levels and narrower, more trade-related National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), which are designed to be taken in the workplace. Thus they should be good both for university entrance and for moving straight into employment. However, academics such as Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Manchester have questioned whether it is possible for one qualification to achieve both aims. Also, a report by government inspectors of schools and further education colleges earlier this week suggested that students were still being steered towards A-levels by careers counsellors, even if they had little chance of passing them. Other companies involved include Girobank, Hilton National, the NHS Training Directorate, Peugeot and the Post Office.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Row over milk study grows 
text:  The gathering controversy over licensing in Europe of a milk-boosting hormone for cows takes a new turn today with three UK scientists accusing the manufacturer of seeking to suppress research pointing to adverse effects on the health of cows. Writing in the weekly scientific journal Nature, the scientists say that Monsanto, the US biotechnology company, provided them with results of trials on the incidence of mastitis in cows treated with the hormone, but refused to let them publish their analyses of the data. European Union agriculture ministers are due to decide at the end of the year whether to lift a ban on the use of bovine somatotrophin (BST). The hormone, an artificially produced version of one that occurs naturally in cows, increases milk output by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. It went on sale in the US in February, but has met opposition from consumer and animal welfare groups in Europe and from the European Commission, which says that milk is already in surplus. The scientists say they pooled the results of eight trials by Monsanto. They found that BST treatment produced an average 19 per cent increase in the somatic cell count - associated with an increased risk of mastitis - which was highly unlikely to be due to chance. Their request for publication in a veterinary journal was refused by Monsanto's office in Brussels in 1991 and 1992 on the basis that the raw material, and any subsequent analysis of it, was confidential, the authors say. 'Our paper simply seeks to make public results that Monsanto appears to be making little effort to publicise and that we believe are of importance to the debate over the licensing of BST,' they say. The scientists say specialists on intellectual property rights have told them they are entitled to publish their analyses provided acknowledgement of the sources is made, which they are happy to do. Mr Tom McDermott, director of biotechnology communications at Monsanto, said: 'The assertion (by the authors) that they were somehow entitled to publish their analyses of other scientists' work, without approval or acknowledgement, is indefensible.'

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Vickers confirms workforce cut 
text:  Tank builder Vickers is to cut 235 jobs at its twin plants in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne and 65 jobs are to go from Newcastle-based International Research and Development, part of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, it was confirmed yesterday. The Vickers Defence Systems redundancies, for which the company is seeking volunteers, affect managerial, supervisory and support staff. The plants' 513 manufacturing workers are not affected. The cuts are being made in spite of Vickers' success in winning a Pounds 1.1bn order in July from the government for 259 Challenger 2 tanks. Defence systems chief executive Mr John Crowther said the present order book secured the business for five years but the company had to restructure to respond effectively to 'future market opportunities'. The redundancies are to be split equally between the Leeds and Newcastle plants. The company said both would retain the capability to manufacture complete tanks. A spokesman said the company, which currently employs 1,640 people, was reducing the levels of management. The loss of the 65 white-collar IRD jobs, confirmed by Rolls-Royce yesterday, is a further blow for Tyneside, which has been hit by a wave of redundancies this year. IRD carries out research and development in materials testing, ceramics and other fields. It currently employs 156 people. The job cuts, affecting scientists, engineers and technicians, are the result of a fundamental review of IRD following a serious fire at its premises in March. Until now, half of IRD's work has been for Rolls-Royce companies and half for outside clients, including Nuclear Electric, the Ministry of Defence and National Power. The company is to be relocated to the nearby Parsons Power Generation Systems site in Newcastle. Mr David Clelland, Labour MP for Tyne Bridge, whose constituency includes Vickers' Newcastle plant, described the tank maker's job losses as very disappointing, especially in view of the workforce's 'tremendous fight' for the Challenger 2 contract.

text:  Mr Tim Renton, Baroness Thatcher's last chief whip, and Sir Wyn Roberts, former Welsh Office minister, are to retire from parliament at the next general election. Mr Renton, 62, has been Conservative MP for Sussex Mid for 22 years. He said yesterday that it was time for the constituency to be represented by a younger person. A strong pro-European, Mr Renton said that he would spend the remainder of his time in the Commons fighting to ensure 'that the clear water between us and the Labour party is not muddied by stupid calls for Britain to leave the European Union'. Sir Wyn Roberts, Tory MP for Conwy since 1970, told his constituency association in a letter last night that in June he would celebrate 25 years as the constituency's representative. 'I shall then be within a month of my 65th birthday.' Mr Renton has a majority of 20,528 and Mr Roberts of 995.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / CBI warns employers to cut unit labour costs 
text:  Employers must rein back unit labour costs if the UK is to compete effectively with Germany and the US on global markets, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said that the UK's rivals were 'now moving ahead again' in achieving better unit labour costs. He pointed out that UK unit labour costs had fallen 1 per cent in the 12 months to the summer of this year, while Germany's had declined by 3 per cent and those of the US by 2 per cent. 'We are not out of the woods yet,' he added, in spite of low inflation and rising profits and investment levels. Output was only back to 1989 levels and the UK's investment rate was well behind those of most other countries, 'as is our productivity', Mr Davies said. The CBI's increasing concern about unit labour costs has been reinforced by the findings of its latest pay and performance review carried out for the CBI by Ernst &amp; Young, the consultants. This says there has been an 'upward creep in pay settlements' as total earnings have overtaken productivity since the middle of last year. This has contributed to 'higher levels of earnings increases' in the UK compared with the country's main competitors. The report adds that UK labour productivity is still low - 40 per cent below that of the US and between 10 per cent and 16 per cent less than in Germany and Japan. Mr Michael Kaltz, partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'The pressures now facing employers are enormous.' The report warns British employees 'are increasingly conscious that the pendulum is beginning to swing in their direction' with the economic recovery while their take-home pay is being squeezed by tax increases. The survey urges employers to keep down their non-wage labour costs as well as the level of pay deals.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / City hopes exceeded by rise in retail sales 
text:  Retail sales rose faster than City expectations last month, but official figures released yesterday indicated that shops were having to cut prices to attract customers. Sales volumes rose an estimated, seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between July and August, outpacing City forecasts of 0.3 per cent. The Central Statistical Office said volumes were also 3.7 per cent higher than the same month last year. The volume of sales was biggest in food, clothing and household goods, where price competition is most fierce. Cold weather and competitive pricing boosted sales of autumn fashion ranges, giving the clothing sector its best month for this financial year. Competitive pricing strategies appeared to affect the seasonally adjusted values of retail sales, which rose at almost the same rate as volumes, by 3.9 per cent from the same month last year. On the basis of three-month figures, which are considered a better guide to trends, the growth in sales by food retailers far exceeded those in any other sector and the retail sector as a whole. In the three months to September the seasonally adjusted volume of sales by food retailers increased 1.7 per cent from the previous three months, while sales volumes of mixed businesses such as department stores and mail-order houses were 1.0 per cent higher and those of specialist non-food retailers only 0.1 per cent higher. Non-seasonally adjusted values for food retailers were also significantly higher than any other sector. In July to September the value of sales by food retailers was 6.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The value of sales by mixed businesses were 3.9 per cent higher and specialist non-food retailers saw their values rise 2.4 per cent. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that retailers were achieving volume increases by aggressive discounting. 'Retail sales growth is being bought at the expense of profitability,' he said. Recent figures have been giving contradictory evidence about consumer demand. The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey, published on Tuesday, showed the fastest rate of growth since December 1993. The CSO's estimate for August sales initially showed a 0.3 per cent fall, However, although that was revised upwards to a 0.1 per cent decline yesterday. Quarterly figures, which smooth out volatility in month-on-month data, show that the volume of sales in July to September was 0.9 per cent higher than in the previous three months and 3.6 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The Treasury welcomed the data as a signal of a continuing steady upward trend in retail sales. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director at the British Retail Consortium, said the figures gave retailers reason to 'look forward with cautious optimism to growth through the Christmas trading period'. But Mr David Hillier, UK economist at NatWest Markets, said: 'Some people are going to get hung up on the increase in volumes being higher than expected.' He said that since both quarterly and annual growth had been hovering around the same levels since the end of 1993, 'growth appears to have reached a plateau'. And while the overall figures appeared to indicate a recovery in retail sales after a fall in August, analysts pointed out that consumer spending was not increasing so dramatically.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Political Notebook: The case for an imaginative Budget 
text:  If Mr Kenneth Clarke is to be believed we are in for a dull Budget. No net reduction in the tax burden, no onslaught against the welfare state, no radical reshaping of the tax and benefits system. The stable state economics now in fashion at 11 Downing Street do not make for political excitement. Of course it will not be quite as bad as that. Mr Clarke will not be able to resist the odd theatrical flourish. Keen as he is to don the mantle of fiscal rectitude the chancellor is an accomplished politician. The Tory back benches must be given something to cheer. The commentators must be offered one of those intricate Treasury wheezes which will allow them to pronounce on the day that he has produced a 'clever package'. No tax cuts overall does not preclude substantial amounts of cash being shuffled around. Mr Clarke must ensure also that the future holds more promise than the present, that virtue will have its reward in a pre-election tax bribe. Abstract concepts like permanently low inflation and steady growth do not win elections. Economic security is important. But the voters want to feel good as well as secure. That means rising disposable incomes. The outlook for the public sector borrowing requirement is more promising than the chancellor admits. It may still be about Pounds 30bn this year and is likely to remain above Pounds 20bn in 1995-96. But beyond that ministers expect a much sharper fall towards balance. Just in time for a spring 1997 election. Public spending will play a critical role. Pre-election tax cuts will depend on firm spending restraint in the two next years. The reins, of course, will be relaxed in the immediate approach to the election. They always are. But that makes it more, not less important, to hold the line now. By all accounts the meetings of EDX, the cabinet committee charged with delivering the spending totals, have been unspectacular affairs. There have been some amusing moments. One came when Mr Michael Portillo explained with a perfectly straight face that he had not been 'serious' when he demanded as chief secretary to the Treasury a 60 per cent cut in a large chunk of the employment budget. There has been pain for other spending ministers. The road-building budget has been a particular target. Other departments with big capital spending allocations, health among them, have been told the private finance initiative provides scope for a smaller contribution from the taxpayer. In parallel the Treasury is adopting its familiar and irrational 'equality of misery' approach, which says that every department must deliver savings whatever the respective size of, or demands on, services. Notwithstanding the draconian cuts in its own manpower, the Treasury's fundamental spending reviews have stalled in the mud of consolidationism. The defence budget is off-limits and Mr John Major has decreed that the government must stick to its pledge to increase real spending on health. The social security budget should deliver big savings as a result of lower inflation and falling unemployment. There will be a squeeze also on housing benefit and, perhaps, on income support for mortgage interest payments. But Mr Jonathan Aitken, the new chief secretary, has discovered that further significant structural changes will have to await a fifth Tory election victory. It is scarcely surprising that he is talking already about introducing technical changes in the way the spending round is conducted. The net result of all this should be cuts in spending targets broadly in line with the better inflation and growth outlook. Such 'automatic' savings should add up to more than Pounds 3bn next year. But the most interesting aspect of the Budget may be the least obviously spectacular - the extent to which Mr Clarke improves incentives at the bottom end of the income scale. Finding routes back into employment for the nation's underclass is not the stuff of tabloid headlines. It is one of the more serious economic and political issues of the 1990s. Next Monday the Labour party will provide some of its answers with the publication of the report by its Social Justice Commission. It will suggest a range of measures - costly at first but self-financing in the longer term  -to break the dependency culture caused by the interaction of the benefits, national insurance and benefits structure. Mr Portillo will counter with details of the tougher test for unemployment benefit which will be applied under the government's new Jobseeker's allowance. But crackdowns on 'scroungers' are not enough. Mr Clarke must show in the Budget a deeper understanding of the poverty and benefit traps which keep the poor dependent on the state, and demonstrate that he is prepared to spend money in the short-term to cure a long-term problem. Fiscal orthodoxy and imagination do not have to be mutually exclusive.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Industry reports buoyant orders 
text:  Manufacturing companies are enjoying buoyant domestic orders and are planning to invest more in plant and equipment, according to the latest survey from the British Chambers of Commerce. The proportion of companies working at full capacity has jumped sharply and is not far short of the pre-recession levels reached in 1989. The survey deducts the proportion of those reporting a decrease in a factor, from those reporting an increase, to derive a per cent balance. In the third quarter a balance of 35 per cent of manufacturing companies reported an increase in home deliveries, up from 29 per cent in the previous quarter. There was also a rise in the balance of those reporting higher home orders. On the export side there was a small fall in the balance of those reporting higher deliveries, but a slight rise in those reporting higher orders. Among service companies there was a slight fall in the balance of those reporting higher home deliveries, but there were small rises in both home and export orders. The survey shows signs that the economy might be gathering speed and encountering capacity constraints. In the manufacturing sector the balance of those reporting that they are working at full capacity has risen from 29 per cent to 37 per cent, while in the service sector it has risen from 22 per cent to 29 per cent. There was a slight rise in the balance of manufacturing companies reporting recruitment difficulties, and the balance remains at its highest level since 1990. However, companies can increase capacity by investing in new plant and equipment and the balance of manufacturing companies which are planning to do so has risen from 22 per cent to 26 per cent. The home counties north is experiencing the fastest sales growth of all the UK regions, while Scotland is witnessing the slowest. The Chambers of Commerce survey is compiled from data from 7,665 companies, employing 1.14m people, and was carried out between September 2 and September 23.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / CBI warns employers to cut labour costs 
text:  Employers must rein back unit labour costs if the UK is to compete effectively with Germany and the US on global markets, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said that the UK's rivals were 'now moving ahead again' in achieving better unit labour costs. He pointed out that UK unit labour costs had fallen 1 per cent in the past 12 months to the summer of this year, while Germany's had declined by 3 per cent and those of the US by 2 per cent. 'We are not out of the woods yet,' he added, in spite of low inflation and rising profits and investment levels. Output was only back to 1989 levels and the UK's investment rate was well behind those of most other countries, 'as is our productivity', Mr Davies said. The CBI's increasing concern over unit labour costs has been reinforced by the findings of its latest pay and performance review carried out for the CBI by Ernst &amp; Young, the consultants. This says there has been an 'upward creep in pay settlements' as total earnings have overtaken productivity since the middle of last year. This has contributed to 'higher levels of earnings increases' in the UK compared with the country's main competitors. The report adds that UK labour productivity is still low - 40 per cent below that of the US and between 10 per cent and 16 per cent less than in Germany and Japan. Mr Michael Kaltz, partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'The pressures now facing employers are enormous.' The report warns British employees 'are increasingly conscious that the pendulum is beginning to swing in their direction' with the economic recovery while their take-home pay is being squeezed by tax increases. It adds: 'Current and planned legislation has both reduced the levels of take-home pay for employees and increased the burden on the employer. As the upturn strengthens possible skill shortages and greater mobility could revive employees' negotiating power.' The survey urges employers to keep down their non-wage labour costs as well as the level of pay deals. It suggests that companies should look more closely at the provision of cars to their employees to see whether they meet a market need. The survey believes that while a temptation exists to make concessions on more holiday time and shorter working hours, these might be regretted when skill shortages emerge. The survey recommends that companies examine boardroom pay levels to ensure that directors' remuneration is linked to performance improvement. It favours more variable pay schemes with bonuses unconsolidated into basic rates.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Food sales show no sign of slowing: Clothing sector reports cold weather boost for autumn fashion ranges 
text:  Cold weather and competitive pricing helped boost sales of new autumn fashion ranges, giving the clothing sector its best month for the financial year, while food sales continued to show no signs of slowing down, the British Retail Consortium said yesterday. The good news arrived as the Central Statistical Office reported that retail sales volumes grew by an estimated, seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between August and September and 3.7 per cent in the previous 12 months. According to the BRC women's clothing and footwear were star performers as overall volume sales by clothing and footwear retailers increased 1.2 per cent between August and September. On the basis of three-month figures, which are considered a better guide to trends, the growth in sales by food retailers, where competition is fierce, far exceeded those in any other sector and the retail sector as a whole. In the three months to September the seasonally adjusted volume of sales by food retailers increased 1.7 per cent from the previous three months, while sales volumes of mixed businesses such as department stores and mail-order houses were 1.0 per cent higher and those of specialist non-food retailers were only 0.1 per cent higher. Non-seasonally adjusted values for food retailers were also significantly higher than any other sector. In July to September the value of sales by food retailers was 6.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year. The value of sales by mixed businesses were 3.9 per cent higher and specialist non-food retailers saw their values rise 2.4 per cent. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the official figures were perhaps misrepresenting total activity in the food market because the CSO surveys all large retailers while it only obtains figures from a sample of small businesses. He said: 'I think they are fully capturing the gains made by big retailers, but I do not think they are capturing the loss of market share by small food retailers.' Household goods stores also saw a boost in sales volumes as a result of aggressive pricing, rising 0.9 per cent in September compared with August. According to the BRC, however, the depressed housing market took its toll on furniture and carpets retailers. The dull housing market subdued sales by DIY retailers. While the overall figures appeared to indicate a recovery in retail sales after a fall in August, many analysts pointed out that consumer spending was not increasing so dramatically. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at broker Salomon Brothers, said: 'If volumes are growing steadily, normally you would say that consumer spending is relatively buoyant, but it is hard to read it that way because the values are slowing.'

text:  Lloyd's of London is prepared to make a fresh attempt at forging an out-of-court deal between loss-making Names and the professional agencies they are suing, Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of the insurance market, indicated yesterday. If there is a 'strong mood and some optimism' that a deal is possible, he and Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, 'will do everything that we can to see that that settlement is reached,' Mr Middleton said. His comments, at a conference organised by accountancy and banking company Smith &amp; Williamson, followed the opening this week of the latest court battle mounted by Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market. The Feltrim Names Association is claiming Pounds 525m in damages for losses incurred in the late 1980s as a result of 'spiral' insurance by which underwriters agreed to cover others for excessive losses from catastrophes. Earlier this year Names rejected a Lloyd's settlement offer worth Pounds 900m. Subsequently the Gooda Walker action group won damages it says are worth Pounds 504m. Mr Middleton believed the Gooda Walker case had not acted as the catalyst for an out-of-court settlement for other legal actions largely because the level of damages had yet to be agreed. A final level might not be set for some weeks. But he said that 'in a couple of weeks' he and Mr Rowland would assess the strength of support for a deal among Names' groups and the errors-and-omissions insurers who provided Lloyd's managing and members' agencies with cover against negligence awards. The insurers feel that the action groups might have to accept that they will never recoup a large part of their losses - because the errors-and-omissions cover is not sufficient and much of it is underwritten by other Names. Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton, who are keen to mark a break from Lloyd's past losses, are reluctant to make an enhanced central contribution to any offer. But there is optimism among Lloyd's authorities that it might be possible to strike a deal before the end of next year. Lloyd's hopes to have established Newco by then - a company set up to take on the liabilities outstanding from policies written in 1985 and before. That might clarify the position of many Names involved in litigation.

text:  Senior Tory councillors and officials of Westminster City Council discussed the 'economic justification for gerrymandering', according to handwritten notes by its housing director, the public inquiry into the council's housing policies was told yesterday. The allegations were made during the first day of public hearings held by Mr John Magill, the council's district auditor. The hearings follow his provisional findings announced in January that six councillors and four council officials should be surcharged Pounds 21.25m for their part in alleged 'gerrymandering' of council house sales. A group of Labour councillors and local residents who objected to the policy claim that council homes in eight marginal wards were sold off to bolster the Conservative vote in the 1990 local elections. Mr Andrew Arden QC, representing the objectors, told the hearing that Mr Graham England, the housing director, took notes of a working lunch on June 30 1986 which was attended by four leading councillors, including Dame Shirley Porter, the then leader. He said Mr England's notes of the discussion included references to 'economic justification for gerrymandering on housing', 'who is a Tory voter', and 'but will company lets vote Tory?' Mr Arden said: 'This is an extraordinary, bizarre and frankly improper conversation to be recorded by a director of housing.' Mr England is one of the 10 individuals provisionally recommended for the surcharge. Mr Arden also quoted from a series of interviews with councillors and officials which had been carried out by Mr Magill during his four-year investigation. He said that these interviews showed that the council was being run as a 'triumvirate' by Dame Shirley, Mr Barry Legg, her chief whip at the time and now Conservative MP for Milton Keynes SW, and Mr David Weeks, her then deputy. He quoted an interview with Mr Anthony Prendergast, a long-serving Conservative councillor, who said that after the 1986 local elections the council was being run by a 'cabal' which told the backbenchers what to do. Mr Arden said the interviews showed that the result of the May 1986 election, in which the Conservatives' majority was reduced to four, had given them a 'great shock'. He also focused on a set of notes made by Mr England on June 24 that year, this time of a special meeting of chief council officials which was addressed by Dame Shirley, Mr Legg, and Mr Weeks. Mr England recorded that one of the objectives of the Tory majority group was 'social engineering including housing'. Mr Arden said the respondents would 'no doubt' argue about this term in the coming weeks of the hearings, but he said their arguments would not be well-founded. He said a council should serve those who already lived there, not 'select the electorate they wish to serve'. He added that a council should not 'bribe people into an area by selling them discounted housing or push people out either'. Dame Shirley, who contests the charges, appeared at the hearings but did not speak. Before entering she told journalists: 'This is not justice.' She said the shouts of protesters outside the hearings showed that she had been 'judged guilty before this inquiry'. Once inside the hearings, held in the council's chamber on London's Marylebone Road, she laughed when Mr Magill said: 'I have reached no decision adverse to any individual.' The hearings continue today and are expected to last for about six weeks.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Abbey chief urges flexible savings policies 
text:  The savings policies and loans offered by high street banks and building societies must become more flexible in order to reflect social changes, Lord Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National, said yesterday. Highlighting the extent to which recent profit improvements had been the result of lower provisions for bad debts rather than sharply higher earnings, he suggested that future growth could be more difficult to find in traditional markets and products. He said the shrinking of the younger age groups and the rise in the number of older people would mean a drop in first-time buyers entering the housing market, with a growth in demand for savings. This could mean 'a new challenge to keep both sides of the balance sheet matched and growing'. Job insecurity and a greater emphasis on the need for women to be financially independent - arising partly from a higher level of divorce - were features which financial services organisations would have to take into account. Against this background, he said that lenders should design mortgages which gave borrowers more flexible commitments - including the repayment terms - and should develop more accessible savings products which reflected consumers' reluctance to undertake regular repayments. This could mean mortgages where customers could vary repayments for part of the loan within certain limits, or could choose a loan with an interest rate changeable within certain limits. It could also lead to changes in the endowment policies linked to mortgages which might take more account of the prospect that they might not be maintained for the full-term. Other changes he identified were that people would regard their homes more as a source of capital, and that they would become more aware of the benefits of hedging their risks. Delivering the Gilbart lecture, Lord Tugendhat also restated his view that mutual financial organisations - such as building societies - lacked sufficient accountability to their members. Abbey National, one of the biggest mortgage lenders, was a building society until it converted to plc status.

The northern region Trades Union Congress executive agreed at its monthly meeting that the TUC, on behalf of all member unions, should approach Samsung. Union leaders in the region hope that the company, which expects to employ 3,000 people at its Wynyard complex, will agree to the recognition of a single union, in the way Nissan did when it selected Sunderland as its European car plant site a decade ago. The collective approach is intended to avoid a union free-for-all. The unions said they had worked closely with the team of agencies which helped win the Samsung project. The progressive local approach to labour relations had, they said, been a contributory factor in Samsung's decision. Initial indications from Samsung are not encouraging for the unions. There is no union at the company's television plant in Billingham, Cleveland. Mr Walter Measor, general affairs director of Samsung Electronics Manufacturing UK, said: 'We don't believe a union is necessary.'

text:  Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was sentenced to 11 years and three months imprisonment in the US yesterday for his role in the multi-billion dollar fraud at the collapsed bank. He was also ordered to pay Dollars 255.4m (Pounds 161.6m) restitution. The sentence, which was handed down at a federal court in Washington, was the maximum permitted under a plea agreement worked out between Mr Naqvi's lawyers and the US Department of Justice. It makes Mr Naqvi the most senior BCCI officer yet jailed over the fraud. However, the sentence will be reduced by the three years and one month Mr Naqvi has already spent in detention in Abu Dhabi and the US. The Justice Department said it would apply for a further reduction if Mr Naqvi assists with its investigations into BCCI over the next year. Mr Naqvi pleaded guilty in July to three criminal charges of fraud and conspiracy at BCCI, which was closed by international regulators three years ago. He admitted he engaged with other BCCI executives in a racketeering conspiracy secretly to control several US banks. Mr Naqvi will face additional charges in New York tomorrow when he is due to be arraigned before a state court there. Prosecutors acting for Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, are pushing for a further, higher sentence. The move is seen in part as an attempt to force him to help with their own inquiries into the BCCI affair. Mr Joseph diGenova, Naqvi's lawyer, said his client has already given considerable help to a number of investigators since being being sent to the US by Abu Dhabi five months ago. These include the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Internal Revenue Service and the Immigration and Naturalisation Service, he said. Mr Naqvi has also been interviewed before two federal Grand Juries in the past three weeks, in Atlanta and Washington. One investigator who has followed the BCCI case from its inception said that these Grand Juries were weighing whether to indict junior BCCI employees, implying that the Justice Department has halted investigations into whether outsiders, including prominent figures in the US, may have aided in the BCCI fraud. However, Mr diGenova said Mr Naqvi was helping with inquiries into several people outside the bank, including some who resided in the US. Jim Kelly adds: BCCI creditors have agreed to accept Dollars 1.8bn in compensation from Abu Dhabi, a creditors' spokesman said in London yesterday. Mr Tony Scott of the British-based BCCI Depositors Protection Association (DPA) said creditor committees in Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands and Britain, where the collapsed bank was registered, had now accepted the offer.

text:  The US Justice Department confirmed yesterday it had launched an investigation into allegations dealers on the Nasdaq stock market illegally fixed their prices to profit at the expense of investors. The investigation follows the publication earlier this year of two academic studies which claimed to have found evidence Nasdaq dealers had secretly agreed to keep spreads - the difference between the price at which they buy and sell shares for investors - unnecessarily wide in order to maximise their profits. Ater the studies the spreads on leading stocks were halved. Nasdaq is the second largest stock market in the US after the New York Stock Exchange, listing the shares of such well known companies as Apple Computer and Microsoft, and under its system investors buy and sell stocks at prices quoted to them by dealers. The wider the spread between the buy and the sell price, the more money the dealers make on each trade. Since the studies were published earlier this year, more than a dozen class-action lawsuits have been filed alleging that Nasdaq dealers - among them some of Wall Street's biggest names - violated US anti-trust laws by alleged price-fixing practices. Yesterday's announcement is the first sign that the government is looking into the matter. The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs Nasdaq, said yesterday that it had not been contacted by the Justice Department, and said that it was 'standard procedure' for the department to follow up on class-action lawsuits, which NASD described as 'baseless'.

text:  The US trade deficit for goods and services narrowed 13 per cent to Dollars 9.7bn in August from Dollars 11.2bn in July, but the merchandise trade deficit was the second largest since July 1987 at Dollars 14.3bn, though down 10 per cent from Dollars 15.9bn in July. US exports of aircraft and capital goods helped boost foreign sales of goods and services for the month to a record Dollars 59.8bn, up from Dollars 56.3bn in July. Imports rose too, but more slowly, from Dollars 67.5bn to almost Dollars 69.6bn. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said substantial jumps in exports of aircraft, motor vehicles and parts were 'rebounds from unusually low levels in July related to planned shut-downs in some aircraft and auto plants.' He said the growth trend in exports 'reflects both the underlying competitiveness of the US export sector and accelerating recoveries in some of our major trading partners. In particular, our goods trade deficit with Western Europe declined by Dollars 748m in August.' For the first eight months of 1994, the trade deficit rose by 51 per cent over the same period a year ago - from Dollars 47.76bn to Dollars 72bn. Any significant improvement will require a narrowing of the bilateral deficit with Japan. Instead, the gap has continued to rise, hitting Dollars 41.9bn during the first eight months of the year, compared with Dollars 37bn during the same period of last year. US officials have been warning Japan for months the deficits are 'politically unacceptable.' Any slowdown in the US economy next year could produce calls for import curbs on Japan from the new Congress. Mr Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist with Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank, attributed the rise to record volumes of imports and 'only a limited acceleration' of US exports to Japan. 'Earlier predictions of a decline were incorrect because they did not factor in that the US cannot produce many of the products it buys from Japan and that Japanese companies are not raising dollar prices in proportion to the strong yen,' he said. Deficits were also recorded with China (Dollars 3.2bn) and western Europe (Dollars 1.6bn). Merrill Lynch economists yesterday predicted improvement, saying: 'Europe and Japan are coming out of their slumps and should grow faster than the US next year for the first time since 1990. That should lead to rising US net exports and a shrinking US current account deficit.'

text:  Mr Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister, has given notice hefty public spending cuts will be the prime tool to reach the Liberal government's deficit-reduction targets. He told the House of Commons late on Tuesday he was determined to cut the federal budget deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by the fiscal year ending March 31 1997, from 5.4 per cent this year. 'It is a target we will meet, come hell or high water,' Mr Martin said. The target implies a reduction in the budget deficit from a projected CDollars 39.7bn (Pounds 18.7bn) in the current fiscal year to about CDollars 25bn in 1997. Mr Martin estimated the government needs about Dollars 3.1bn in spending cuts or tax increases next year and another CDollars 6.3bn in 1996/97. He plans specific proposals in his next budget, due in February. The budget is seen as a critical test for investor confidence in Canada. Together with Italy and Sweden, Canada has the heaviest debt burden among industrial countries. Interest payments are projected to reach CDollars 47.3bn this year, over a quarter of total federal spending. Financial markets are likely to focus on Ottawa's willingness to take the axe to federal social programmes, which consume about one-quarter of this year's CDollars 166bn budget, and on transfers to the provinces for health, welfare and education, totalling CDollars 27bn. The government published a discussion paper on sweeping social-security reform this month. It contained few specific proposals, but it has run into strong criticism and Mr Martin's cabinet colleagues may be less enthusiastic about painful and unpopular cuts.

text:  If Haiti's newly reinstated President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is going to stay in office, the politics of his survival will have to be played out largely in the country's devastated rural areas. Seventy-five per cent of Haiti's population live in the countryside, where successive governments have used their control of land tenure, especially in the rice-producing Artibonite valley where nearly all the country's irrigated land is located, to enrich their supporters. President Aristide is expected to nurture his constituency there too, but his still sketchy agricultural policy and the skewed rural economic patterns caused by military rule and the international economic embargo will make it difficult. The military government, which held power for the past three years, virtually abandoned the valley, preferring to make money from controlling both legal and contraband rice imports. Before the military, Francois 'Papa Doc' and later his son Jean Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier siphoned off the spoils of the valley into their paramilitary force, the Tontons Macoutes and set off a migration of peasants into the shantytowns of the capital, Port-au-Prince. There they formed the backbone of the popular organisations that spearheaded Baby Doc's downfall in 1986. Although Baby Doc had initiated a World Bank-designed economic reform package in 1982, import permits were still needed for rice and other grains and were difficult to obtain. However, the government that replaced him, led by General Henry Namphy, under pressure to be recognised by the US and maintain the flow of foreign lending, opened the country to rice imports, setting off a guerrilla rice war of roadblocks and shootouts. By the time of Father Aristide's election in 1990 rice imports from the US were worth Dollars 39m (Pounds 24.6m) annually and satisfied a quarter of domestic demand. The peasant groups involved in this rice war were the main supporters of the lavalas (flash flood) movement that swept Fr Aristide to power. According to some of his rural supporters, President Aristide lacked a coherent agricultural policy and therefore the country remained open to rice imports, hurting lavalas's ability to transform itself into a workable governing coalition. 'The Artibonite is where you make or break a government in Haiti,' says Mr Anil Juste, an agronomist and historian of the valley. 'If you can control the production and distribution of rice you can control the country.' But President Aristide will find controlling the valley an awesome task. Land disputes are ongoing and violent, as no one knows who has the right to farm what plots and there is no working system of land titles. The government owns most of the land but has in the past rent it for nominal sums to powerful allies who in turn rented tracts to local peasant sharecroppers. Some plots changed hands as many as three times a year and planting an area did not guarantee the right to harvest it. 'The first thing people will do when the embargo is lifted and the price of cement falls is build walls around land they control but do not necessarily own.' says an agricultural official. 'Aristide may try to help the peasants through credits and such but land reform is out of the question. How do you know what land to give away if you don't know what land you have?' Annual rice production has fallen from 125m tonnes during Fr Aristide's year in office to less than 80m tonnes since the embargo was imposed. The emergency food aid that flooded the cities during the embargo have meant that much of the rice produced in the valley had no market, according to officials at the World Food Programme. In an effort to jump-start production, the Inter-American Development Bank has earmarked more than Dollars 17m for rehabilitation of the irrigation system in the Artibonite, while the World Bank has a long-term project to map the area to settle land disputes. In return, international lending agencies are expecting that President Aristide, as he has publicly pledged to do, will keep the country open to food and other imports. Tariffs on legally imported rice will be cut in half 'for a transitory period' until being eliminated altogether, according to the Aristide economic plan approved by lending agencies. There is a consensus among agricultural economists that even as Haiti increases its rice production it will need to maintain rice imports to feed its population. 'There is a vacuum of agricultural policy that will be filled quickly by the World Bank and the IADB,' says Mr Juste. He says the productive programmes of the multilateral institutions can help construct democracy in Haiti only if they put a premium on helping small producers while breaking the grip of landholders who have become accustomed to making money off rents and political power rather than from producing food.

headline:  FT  20 OCT 94 / Hamas raises terror campaign to new pitch in Israel: The attacks have now come to dominate the political agenda of both Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin 
text:  The devastating bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv yesterday marks the increasing confidence and power of Hamas, the militant Islamic group, which has pledged to destroy the peace process, the state of Israel, and usher in an Islamic republic based on Koranic law. An anonymous caller told Israel radio that the bombing had been carried out in the name of some 400 Hamas activists expelled by Israel for several months to a no-man's land in Lebanon in December 1992. He said he wanted to thank the government for deporting the Hamas members where they had received training in sabotage and explosives. 'We know how to carry out attacks and we will carry out other attacks,' he said. The threat is very real. In the past fortnight, Hamas has struck a new level of terror into the heart of Israeli society; spraying a busy Jerusalem shopping promenade with bullets and killing two people; kidnapping and killing a 19-year-old Israeli soldier; and carrying out yesterday's attack in the commercial centre of Tel Aviv. Its increasingly successful military campaign against Israeli civilians and soldiers has come to dominate the political agenda of both Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister. The attacks have shown that Hamas has the political initiative and can influence the pace of the peace process. Furthermore it has now laid down an open challenge to Mr Arafat for the leadership of the Palestinian people and defied him to take repressive measures at the risk of civil war. Experts on the extremist movement, which has a growing support base of between 20-40 per cent of Gaza's 850,000 residents, say Hamas does not want Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin to suspend the peace process. Rather their strategy is to cripple it, thereby ensuring that Mr Arafat fails to deliver on his promises to his people of new jobs, alleviation of poverty and a gradual assumption of legitimate Palestinian rights. These include the return of Israeli-occupied land, the right of return of up to 4m Palestinian refugees and the establishment of an independent state, with Arab East Jerusalem as its capital. Each time Hamas carries out an attack Israel seals off the Gaza Strip, preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from travelling to their jobs inside Israel. Last week Israel briefly suspended peace talks following the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier. Such moves play into the hands of Hamas by showing Palestinians how weak Mr Arafat is, and how dependent on Israeli goodwill. Israeli demands for Mr Arafat to smash the military wing of Hamas are also easily exploited by the Islamic group as Mr Arafat doing Israel's dirty work for them. Last week's mass arrests of Hamas activists in Gaza by Mr Arafat's security forces were met with demonstrations and riots, accompanied by threats of civil war. Hamas's military wing warned Mr Arafat that if he continued arresting its supporters it would reply 'by setting the Gaza Strip ablaze'. Hamas continues to benefit from the very limited gains Palestinians have reaped from the peace process and the poor performance so far of the ineffectual Palestinian authority. Like other militant Islamic groups, Hamas thrives on despondency, poverty and the failure of secular Arab governments to restore pride and economic wellbeing to their peoples. Many Palestinians feel Mr Arafat gave up the Palestinian struggle in return for a virtual bantustan in a part of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Months after the PLO was supposed to have taken over the West Bank and held elections, Mr Arafat's peace negotiators remain locked in negotiations with Israel in Cairo. Furthermore, after three months in power, Mr Arafat has yet to put together a credible government capable of tackling the massive task of rehabilitating the derelict Gaza Strip and combating an unemployment rate of 40-50 per cent. Part of his failures are self-imposed - a result of centralisation of power and an aversion to transparent government. International donors, choking on their own bureaucracy, are also to blame for the slow drip of promised emergency funds. As Mr Arafat struggles to deliver real economic and political change, Hamas continues to provide better services through its social welfare network of schools, clinics and kindergartens. Hamas also offers a strong moral message and a religious certainty in a period of upheaval and instability. In a recent interview, Mr Mahmoud Zohar, a leading Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said his organisation welcomed the return of Mr Arafat to Gaza because his obvious failures would expose the moral, economic and political bankruptcy of secular Arab government and encourage Palestinians to turn to the Islamic solution. 'Arafat's return hastens the coming of the Islamic state,' he said. But it is not just Mr Arafat's failings that contribute to the flow of recruits to Hamas. Hatred and suspicion of Israel remain deeply rooted in the hearts of many Palestinians. Even amongst PLO supporters, Hamas is viewed as a 'liberation organisation', fighting a legitimate battle against continued Israeli occupation of their land and denial of their rights. Mr Arafat will now come under renewed pressure from Israel to deal a decisive blow to Hamas. For Israel, peace means increased security. During last week's kidnap crisis Mr Rabin said: 'Arafat must choose between making peace with Israel or making peace with Hamas'. It is an acute dilemma for Mr Arafat, while still trying to find his feet as leader of a people in a nascent state. If Mr Arafat does not move against Hamas he risks allowing Israel to continue dragging its feet in talks and so ensuring the vacuum which Hamas so readily exploits.

'I am confident appropriate adjustments will be made in monetary policy that will deliver a 2-3 per cent underlying rate of inflation,' he told a federal parliamentary committee. Mr Fraser also said the government could do better to reduce its forecast budget deficit for 1994-95. The budget has estimated a deficit of ADollars 11.7bn (Pounds 5.8bn) for the year, representing 2.5 per cent of GDP. He warned a better performance on the fiscal side did not reduce the need to tighten monetary policy when necessary. A strong jobs growth reported last week had intensified pressures on the government to raise interest rates. More than 75,000 new jobs were created in September, reflecting an acceleration in economic activity.

text:  NTT, the Japanese tele-communications group, said yesterday it was willing to connect its domestic lines with other carriers, opening Japan's market to fresh competition. However, NTT's president, Mr Masashi Kojima, told a news conference negotiations with new carriers on cost-sharing and other issues were still needed before the lines were connected. The NTT president made his announcement a day after one of the new carriers, Japan Telecom, a competitor in the long-distance market, requested government intervention to resolve a two-year-old dispute over opening up the network NTT dom-inates for high-speed data services. Mr Kojima said he hoped the issue could be settled within about 10 days, without involving the minister of posts and telecommunications. He told journalists: 'NTT has said to all operators that its basic stance is that it is willing to connect its lines to every operator if there are such requests.' Japan's main newspapers had devoted many column inches to the dispute yesterday, with analysts saying that the dispute stemmed from NTT's monopoly of the domestic telephone network and that the lack of progress added weight to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' argument for breaking up NTT. 'It's useless to prolong such troubles any more,' Mr Kojima said, referring to the row with Japan Telecom. 'We hope we can settle the issue soon, possibly within 10 days, without troubling the minister of posts and telecommunications.' Mr Kojima said NTT and Japan Telecom could not agree on line connections during two years of negotiations because NTT hoped to establish broad rules on line connections, including cost-sharing, before dealing with specific demands. 'This is because we expect various demands (on line connections) from various operators, like cable television and virtual private network (VPN) operators,' Mr Kojima said. 'But we would eventually connect with them, as the world's trend is for hooking up lines with various operators. Networking companies won't survive if they move against this direction.' Since October 1992, three long-distance carriers - Japan Telecom, DDI Corp and Teleway Japan - have been trying to persuade NTT to connect their lines with NTT's local leased circuits for corporate use. The operators want to use the circuits for a new and cheaper digital data transmission service called 'frame relay services'. NTT currently monopolises the domestic telephone network, although it has the three companies competing with it in the domestic long-distance market. The status of NTT, which is majority-owned by the Finance Ministry, will be reviewed in the year starting April 1995, when a five-year law governing NTT's status is to expire. In the past 10 years, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has made two attempts to break up NTT but failed due to opposition from political circles.

text:  China is for the moment slowing the pace of economic reform while it seeks to bring inflation under control and head off possible social unrest, Chinese officials told a meeting of the World Economic Forum yesterday. Senior Chinese officials, including Mr Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, indicated that a need for stability was preoccupying the leadership, which he said had made the anti-inflation fight its most important priority for the rest of the year. A World Economic Forum official said after the two-day session organised by the Swiss-based consultative group and attended by government and business leaders that his impression was that the Chinese had entered a 'period of pause. For the moment, what concerns them is taming inflation. They feel they need a period of slower growth rather than starting a new phase of reform.' China's State Statistical Bureau announced on Tuesday that the cost of living nationwide was 27.4 per cent higher in September than the same month last year. Economic growth for the past two years has averaged over 13 per cent. Growth of 11-12 per cent is forecast this year. Beijing introduced price controls last month on staple foodstuffs in an effort to break the inflationary cycle. Food prices have risen sharply in the past year. The World Economic Forum official noted that reformist impulses in Beijing had been subdued in comparison with last year, when Chinese officials were discussing ambitious plans for reform of the banking system and state enterprises. 'Now,' the official said, 'there is a mood of consolidation and caution.' Officials had deflected questions about plans to force state enterprises into bankruptcy under a pilot programme announced earlier this year and meant to target some 100 faltering enterprises in 18 cities. The authorities have been reluctant to bankrupt enterprises because of fears of social unrest among laid-off employees. Government economists estimate that of the 11,000 large and medium state enterprises, about one-third are in the red. Another one-third barely break even. The State Statistical Bureau says that in the first nine months of this year, some 44.5 per cent of state enterprises have made losses. State-owned enterprises have been hard hit in an austerity programme begun last year and aimed at calming the economy. Many enterprises are starved of working capital and some have problems paying employees.

text:  The monetary authorities in the Philippines are moving to tighten liquidity in the financial system to keep inflation within targets prescribed by the International Monetary Fund. The move follows the visit of Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, during which an excess of nearly 8 per cent in the money supply target was discovered. Under the IMF-supervised economic programme approved on June 24, reserve money (currency in circulation, plus deposits and reserves kept by banks with the central bank) was targeted at 148.7bn pesos (Pounds 3.7bn) for September, in line with an inflation rate target of 8.5 per cent by end-1994. A review conducted late in September found that reserve money had reached some 106.5bn pesos, nearly 8 per cent over target. Inflation, which had risen to 9.9 per cent in August, slipped to 8.6 per cent in September. Mr Roberto de Ocampo, finance secretary, pledged to Mr Camdessus to bring down the liquidity level, but did not cite any specific reason for the surge. Analysts said the increase was being traced to the spate of initial public offerings on the local stock market and the refusal of some banks to roll over placements in Treasury bills on expectations of a new rise in interest rates. Mr Camdessus, at the end of his visit on Tuesday, told officials the economy had been performing well, with a first-half growth rate of 5.1 per cent, but 'continued vigilance' was needed against a resurgence of inflation. An IMF team, originally due in Manila in late November, is now being asked to delay its review to December. The authorities appear confident of meeting the end-October reserve money ceiling of 162bn pesos under the IMF programme without fuelling any big increases in rates.

Among the dead, 16 belonged to rival factions of the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement), an ethnic party of Urdu-speaking immigrants from India, which split in a power struggle more than two years ago. The other 13 victims included three policemen. The larger faction of the MQM has been involved in a bitter power struggle with members of a breakaway group which formed a separate party last year. Members of the two factions have been targeting each other in sniper attacks and ambushes, in an effort to establish their authority in the city. While the larger faction of the MQM still appears to have the support of a large number of people, it is not clear if either of the two sides is gaining ground decisively. Efforts by the Pakistani government to negotiate an end to the violence have so far produced no results. But the killings have once again sparked fears among the city's businessmen, worried that security fears will deter investors away from Karachi. Senior officials say privately that at least part of the violence has resulted from the involvement of unemployed, educated youth. The city has Pakistan's fastest growing population living in slums.

text:  When the World Cup football semi-final was taken off Vietnam's state-run television channel in July and replaced with a eulogy to the dead North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, it was a clear sign that Vietnam's communist old guard was beginning to stir. Hardline politburo member Nguyen Duc Binh apparently ordered the change from his hospital bed while reformist prime minister Vo Van Kiet was on a trip to Ho Chi Minh City in the south. While the change of programme irritated Vietnam's football lovers, more fundamental tensions between reformers and conservatives are expected to emerge over the next 10 days as Vietnam's National Assembly convenes a landmark session in the capital, Hanoi, starting today. Inflation, a swelling budget deficit and a review of the last four years of virtually unimpeded foreign investment are expected to top the agenda. Hanoi-based diplomats say the session could also yield a handful of ministerial reshuffles reflecting the fact that officials are starting to be made accountable for economic mismanagement as Vietnam undergoes adjustment of its once centrally planned economy along market lines. They say a prime candidate for demotion is finance minister Ho The, widely blamed for failing to check a swelling budget deficit and making promises of central government funding to provinces that were never fulfilled. 'He's ripe for sacking,' said one veteran economist and government adviser. 'He's made some very contradictory decisions.' Vietnam reacted nimbly to the sudden disappearance of aid in 1989 from its main benefactor, the former Soviet Union, achieving remarkable success in slashing annual inflation from four-digit figures to a respectable 9.9 per cent. The country's staple exports of crude oil, rice, coffee and rubber have helped maintain a much-needed flow of foreign exchange. Incomes, particularly in the cities, are rising fast. Foreign investment has poured in, reaching a total contracted amount of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn) last month. But this year there was an alarming rise in imports in the first six months, resulting in a trade deficit of Dollars 200m. Other disappointing economic statistics have soured the optimism of the past two years, fuelling conservative calls for a re-assessment of doi moi, the term used to refer to the economic reforms officially sanctioned in 1986. Diplomats say the news has worried government planners and fractured the previous fragile consensus among policy-makers that the pace of reform should quicken. Other signs of hardening attitudes include the banning last week of a collection of short stories on the grounds that a prize-winning story was infringing 'the policy and religious faith and national solidarity of the party and the government'. What worries the conservatives - understood to include Communist party secretary Do Muoi - is the potentially damaging social consequences of some market reforms and the possible erosion of the party's position. 'They're saying (reform is) the worst of all worlds,' said one economist. 'It's seen as representing the devaluation of 'socialist orientation', uncontrolled foreign investment and too much domestic business.' Diplomats and local economists say that the future direction of reform could hinge on the tenor of Mr Kiet's opening speech to the national assembly. 'It's probably the most difficult speech he'll have to make,' said the economist. Mr Kiet is understood to be keen to push through the rubber stamp assembly higher growth, increased reform of the banking system, further restructuring of lumbering state-owned enterprises and increased mobilisation of the private sector. The mood at the session is likely to be sombre. A press release issued last week by the standing committee of the assembly rapidly dispensed with the glowing rhetoric of previous years. Deputy prime minister Phan Van Khai, an avowed reformist, was reported in the local press as having warned the standing committee of the national assembly last week at a preparatory meeting of 'very heavy duties in the rest of the year'. Foreign investors say a sign that some sort of re-assessment was imminent has been uncertainty in the last four months over whether any more foreign banks would be licensed to operate branches in Vietnam. 'No one is sure about the pace of progress,' said one investor, who requested anonymity. Vietnam has allowed branch licences to nine banks. US banks Citibank and Bank of America are believed to be on top of a waiting list of about 20 hoping for branch status.

This decision represents a victory for exporters who complained the agreement had led to excessive charges for shipping container cargoes and a defeat for the 15 large shipping lines which set up the agreement in 1992. The ruling is however only the first stage in resolving this dispute because the shipowners established a modified arrangement, known as the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (TACA) in July. Earlier this month they made a further concession by offering to remove capacity constraints from the TACA. A decision on the TACA is expected within the next few weeks. The British Shippers' Council, representing exporters, said the commission's ruling established an important principle which would have implications for similar conference agreements covering trade with the Far East and Africa. If the TACA is also rejected there could be a return to lower transatlantic shipping rates and a resumption of the losses which plagued this route in the late 1980s. Members of the TAA include P&amp;O, Maersk, Nedlloyd, AP Moeller and Hapag-Lloyd.

text:  Pakistan could become the first major Asian textile producer to agree to open its markets to foreign exports of textiles and clothing, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said yesterday. Praising a tentative agreement reached between the US and Pakistan, Mr Kantor said the 'landmark agreement. . . represents the first time in at least two decades that US textiles and clothing will be permitted in Pakistan'. In response to exporters' demands the US has been pushing for market openings in India, China and other Asian nations more accustomed to seeking markets in the US than opening their own. Mr J. Henry Walker III, of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, said yesterday's new trade figures, showing record volumes of textile and clothing imports, demonstrated the need for market openings in India and China. The tentative pact calls for Pakistan to remove all bans on the import of fibres, yarns, fabrics, home furnishings and clothing by July 1 1995. Tariffs would be lowered over a 10-year period to levels no higher than 10 per cent for many key US yarns, 20 per cent for many fabrics and carpets, 30 per cent for home furnishings and 35 per cent for clothing. Pakistan has also agreed to eliminate prohibitions and duties on the export of raw cotton, which the US textile industry says has resulted in artificially low cotton prices in Pakistan. This gives cotton spinners and weavers 'an unfair competitive advantage'.

text:  Chrysler, the US motor manufacturer, is planning a Dollars 100m joint venture in Vietnam to build minivans and possibly four-wheel drive vehicles. The venture would be the first by a US carmaker since the lifting of the US economic embargo on Vietnam earlier this year. The negotiations come as other international vehicle makers are considering projects in the country, in spite of difficulties in finding local partners with experience in the industry. Mr Robert Eaton, the Chrysler chairman, arrived in Hanoi on Tuesday to meet Mr Vo Van Kiet, prime minister, and the transport and heavy industry ministers to discuss the project. The company's interest in Vietnam follows an early entry into the China market, where production of the Beijing Jeep began in September 1985. In May, Mitsubishi Motors became the first Japanese carmaker to enter a joint venture in Vietnam, quickly followed in June by Renault, the French state-owned group, which signed a letter of intent to begin car assembly in the country. BMW, the German carmaker, has a contract to assemble cars in Vietnam and Mercedes-Benz hopes to do the same. Vietnam is eager to avoid domination of its motor industry by one country and has yet to decide how it will divide up shares of the motor assembly and manufacturing industry. In Chrysler's case, industry sources suggest that the joint venture partner is most likely to be a division of the heavy industry ministry rather than a Vietnamese motor manufacturer. Until two months ago, Chrysler was pursuing negotiations with Mekong Corporation, a three-way venture between Japan, Korea and Vietnam, to build a four-wheel-drive vehicle. However, the deal apparently fell through when the Korean partner made clear it was unwilling to relinquish sufficient equity control to Chrysler. Since then, the US company has been hunting for other partners, determined to set up some sort of facility in Vietnam. It was reported yesterday that the company had already decided on a site for the venture. If Chrysler wanted to sell domestically it would have to find a way round recent foreign currency regulations stipulating that revenue from any product sold in Vietnam must be in dong, the local currency, which is not freely convertible. As an emerging market, Vietnam is viewed with great interest by several leading vehicle makers. Less than 5 per cent of the country's 72m people drive cars.

text:  Asian governments at the World Infrastructure Forum in Jakarta yesterday called on private investors to take a leading role in financing ambitious plans for development of their transport and telecommunications sectors. Indian officials said that by 1997 their country wants to achieve its target of allocating telephones on demand, a programme requiring investment of more than Dollars 8bn. 'This is beyond the capacity of the government funding and generation of resources,' he said. 'Private investment and associations of the private sector would be needed in a big way to bridge the resource gap.' The officials said that for the telecommunications sector to play its assigned role in the country's development, it needs to increase its telephone connections to 60m from the present 8m 'as rapidly as possible'. That will require an estimated investment of Dollars 60bn. While basic telephone services are still lacking, Indian officials said they are also inviting private investment to set up value-added services. A tender is being prepared to invite technical and financial help in setting up cellular mobile phone services outside the main cities of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras. Indonesia said it needs Dollars 12.5bn over the next five years to develop transport infrastructure, including roads, railways, inland waterways, sea port facilities and airport facilities. Indonesia also announced plans to invest more than Dollars 1bn by the year 2005 on water projects in Jakarta. Of this, Dollars 200m would be spent on distribution improvements alone. 'Under these circumstances, efforts should be made to encourage and stimulate private sector participation,' an Indonesian official said. Some 44 per cent of the requirement for Indonesian transport infrastructure development is expected to come from the private sector. The remainder is expected to come from state-owned companies, the government and foreign loans. The Indian government yesterday announced it is tendering for nine projects amounting to 167km of a high-speed tram system in the Delhi area. It is also offering projects on a build-operate-transfer basis for five bypasses, with an estimated cost of Dollars 70m, eight bridges which will cost about Dollars 147m and nine express-ways costing an approximate Dollars 3.5bn. The Philippines listed 175 potential projects worth over Dollars 14bn which are likely to be tendered on a build-operate-transfer basis for highways, transportation, power generation, water systems, tourism, industrial estates and waste management. The Asian Development Bank estimates that Asia needs about Dollars 3,000bn in infrastructure investment between now and 2010 if each country is to achieve its projected economic growth target.

text:  Behind the pomp of Queen Elizabeth's visit to Russia, British and Russian businessmen have been getting on with the 'development of capitalism,' the title of a seminar held on the royal yacht Britannia. Some 50 Russian businessmen and bankers have been invited on board the yacht, moored on the Neva River, just out of sight of the Russian cruiser Aurora where the first shots of the Bolshevik revolution were fired. British Invisibles, an umbrella body promoting invisible trade, had been quick to exploit the publicity surrounding the Queen's visit to stage a sales pitch for the virtues of British banking, legal, accounting, and management consulting services. It was their eigth such foreign event this year and the third occasion on which they had utilised the royal yacht. A string of British advisers represented included Kleinwort Benson, Robert Fleming, Clifford Chance, Freshfields, Smith New Court, Ernst and Young, and Coopers and Lybrand. With Dollars 500m of foreign portfolio investment pouring into Russia every month, the British delegation said equity could provide a cheap and effective means of raising funds to finance the growth of Russian companies. However, they cautioned that substantial preliminary work including accounting and legal studies would be required first. A discussion on financing the growth of a hypothetical Russian company sparked lively debate and highlighted the differences in business cultures. It also emerged that some of the Russian guests had their own sales pitches to make. Mr Cyril Smirnov, president of Astro Bank, a large local commercial bank, suggested that the Russian banking system could provide sufficient funding and that companies did not need the assistance of outsiders. A university lecturer said Russian managers needed re-education and training before they would be up to the task. Many of the Russian guests blanched when the subject of prospective fees was raised. A margin of 5 to 7 per cent to raise Dollars 10m of fresh capital clearly seemed excessive to some - no matter how much it would help fuel future growth. An interpretation of both business cultures was put forward by Mr Igor Kostikov, the managing director of a local stockbroking firm. 'Russian managers are reluctant to accept the loss of control that goes with raising equity capital. But they also worry about taking on the liabilities of corporate debt. They feel that it is enough to survive at the moment and do not yet see the need to grow,' he said. Sir Brian Pearse, chairman of British Invisibles, expressed cautious optimism. 'We do not think that there can be any quick fix for Russia but we are saying very clearly that we will be here for the long term.'

text:  Thailand has put instant coffee on a list of products subject to price control, prompting veiled suggestions from Nestle, the Swiss foods multinational, that foreign investors would take offence at the move. Nestle - whose Thai subsidiary Quality Coffee Products has more than 80 per cent of the local instant coffee market - angered the government by raising prices 10 per cent in July and by refusing commerce ministry demands to reverse the price increase. The dispute came to a head this week when the cabinet authorised the ministry to put instant coffee on the list of controlled consumer products. Instant coffee had been removed from the list two years ago along with 100 other products as part of an economic liberalisation drive. 'This restrictive measure applied to a non-essential product may prove prejudicial to Thailand,' said Mr Andreas Schlaepfer, managing director of the Thai Nestle group, 'particularly since this case has attracted the attention of foreign investors in the region.' He said the 10 per cent rise, the first in three years, was to offset higher operating costs and was unrelated to rising world coffee prices. 'It's not a monopolistic situation at all,' he said. 'There are two other factories here, with large installed capacity and the right technology.' Businessmen in Bangkok believe Nestle has fallen foul of the Thai government's attempts to control inflation, which reached 5.3 per cent in September.

text:  China is heading for 11.5 per cent economic growth this year, compared with a government target of 9 per cent, according to a leading Chinese research institution, which warns the authorities they have yet to get a grip on inflation. In another sign of official concern at the overheating of the economy, the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has introduced a moratorium on investment funds, which it fears are contributing to speculation and draining savings needed to finance government bond issues. China's Academy of Social Sciences believes the booming economy, which grew 13 per cent last year, will begin to slow, but it says the government has been too optimistic in its forecasts for a slowdown. Economists at the academy, regarded as the leading Chinese 'think-tank' on the economy, expressed concern about the continuing surge in inflation. Cost-of-living increases in urban centres are more than 25 per cent up on the same period last year. The Chinese government is engaged in the delicate task of reining in its runaway economy, while avoiding the kind of abrupt dislocation that contributed to the social unrest of the late 1980s. The authorities have been seeking to puncture a boom in capital spending which has been one of the chief causes of inflation. Growth in fixed-asset investment is forecast to slow this year to 12 per cent compared with last year's 50 per cent surge. The credit squeeze appears to be taking its toll on the state sector, according to figures released by the State Statistical Bureau, which showed that output by state firms, half of them in the red, grew by just 2.2 per cent in the first quarter. That compared with output growth of 32.1 per cent for collectives, including township enterprises, and 79.1 per cent for other sectors such as joint ventures. Meanwhile, the People's Bank declared the moratorium on new domestic investment funds in a further attempt to reinforce central controls over an unruly financial sector and channel domestic savings towards the purchase of government bonds. China's official Business Weekly reported that about 50 funds had been established with about Yn4.5bn (Pounds 354m) under their control. Only four had been approved by the central bank. China is relying on the sale of some Yn115bn of treasury bonds to fund its 1994 domestic deficit which is expected to reach Yn67bn. It also faces heavy debt service obligations on borrowings for infrastructure. The freeze on investment funds will not affect foreign-related investment vehicles.

text:  Sweden takes a leaf out of the UK's book this week with its first auction of index-linked government bonds. It is tempting to conclude that the fashion is spreading, although previous attempts by Canada and Australia to get index-linked markets going have not met with conspicuous success. Sweden has spent some time preparing its issue, but the suspicion remains that the timing is determined by a combination of the high cost of fixed-rate borrowing and a heavy funding requirement. The budget deficit is more than 11 per cent of GDP; after last year's heavy recourse to overseas markets, the authorities are now focusing more on domestic investors. Since Swedish inflation is below 2 per cent and the yield on 10-year bonds is more than 8 per cent, the government may consider index-linked borrowing is attractive. The issue is in some ways a statement of defiance. It can be seen as a signal that the markets are wrong to mistrust the authorities' determination to keep inflation down. The chances are that the SKr20bn of 20-year paper on offer will find a home among domestic buyers, including institutions seeking to match their longer-term liabilities. Lack of liquidity may deter international buyers, even though there is a theoretical trading appeal. Since the Swedish paper will carry no coupon, its value will be particularly geared to changes in real interest rates. And since real yields in Sweden have risen strongly in the recent bond market shake-out, the chances are that they will soon be coming down.

Perversely, however, the withdrawal of the world's biggest futures exchange may yet turn out to be Globex's salvation. The unhappy relationship between the system's partners has dogged its development. Reuters will at least be relieved that that uncertainty has been resolved. There is only likely to be a small loss of terminals as a result of CBoT's move. Despite its size, CBoT accounted for just 5 per cent of Globex's transactions. But CBoT's withdrawal may ease the fears of other exchanges concerning Globex's governance. Now that a new agreement is being drawn up, other exchanges, such as Liffe and the DTB, may be tempted to sign up to the system - especially if it is able to offer a bund contract. That may be sufficient to give the network critical mass. The experience of Matif has already shown that Globex is a technical success. The big uncertainty is whether the concept of a round-the-clock, round-the-world futures trading market is a valid one. Even if it succeeds, Globex will take a long time to catch on. The financial impact on Reuters is only likely to prove marginal either way. Reuters has already written off its investment in developing the network. The healthy progress of Instinet and Dealing 2000/2 is likely to mask any further disappointment.

text:  The international offer of shares in Ashanti Goldfields, which closes today, should attract strong institutional support. True, the gold price has been in the doldrums after the excitement of last year. A rising tax charge may also take the shine off Ashanti's earnings growth for the next year or two. But Ashanti is a low-cost producer which boasts quality reserves and rising production. So long as investors are willing to take a relaxed view of political risk in Ghana, a share price towards the top of the indicated Dollars 17-Dollars 20 range looks likely. That outcome would be especially pleasing for Lonrho, which will own 43 per cent of the company after flotation. The interest among investors generated by the offer - and the additional transparency provided by its weighty prospectus - have helped Lonrho's shares outperform the market since the turn of the year. Assuming a share price for Ashanti of Dollars 20, Lonrho's holding would be worth around Pounds 450m - more than its total market capitalisation in the dark days of 1992. If investors now turn their attention to Western Platinum of South Africa, Lonrho's share price may have further to run. Like Ashanti, Lonrho's other large mining investment is a low-cost producer with the promise of rising production. As with gold, a rising metals price cannot be relied upon. Political risk will also be a worry until the turmoil surrounding the South African elections has passed. Then it will be up to Lonrho to prove that it can make its assets sweat more effectively than in the past.

text:  The not-so-new format for reporting company profits has now had a year to bed in. In general, the system is working well, but the abolition of extraordinary items has had the expected effect of making reported earnings more volatile. Investors still want to get a picture of underlying company performance. Most use the Institute of Investment Management Research standard as a guide. It excludes from earnings those capital items which have no impact on continuing operations, but includes costs which are related to mainstream businesses. The underlying earnings picture is still less easy to spot, and investors are looking for other ways to track company performance. In part, that is what the reforms were intended to achieve, since investors had come to rely too heavily on a single crude measure. Earnings are a proxy for distributable cash flow, and if the proxy is failing it makes sense to look at cash directly. More estimates of future cash flows are being produced, and there is a good deal of work going into discounted cash flow modelling. There is also some attention being paid to dividends, since although they do not provide much information about companies' growth prospects, they do hint at management's confidence about the future. Perhaps the most interesting line of attack, however, is in deconstructing analysts' models of company profits to assess where the risks of errors lie. Correctly identifying whether earnings are likely to be higher or lower than consensus forecasts is the kind of deeper analysis that should make institutions money.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Spicy recipe for the Big Apple: Martin Dickson assesses the impact of Mayor Giuliani on New York's long-running financial and social problems 
text:  It is mid-morning in Manhattan and a pudgy 13-year-old boy is playing video games in an amusement arcade just off Times Square, that crossroads of bright lights, sexual sleaze and tourist tat. A team from New York City's new anti-truancy police squad accosts the child, orders him into a van, and detains him for 90 minutes on suspicion of skipping school. A crackdown on classroom absenteeism may not be one of the weightiest reforms introduced to New York in the past three months by its mayor, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, yet it is symbolically significant: the city's first Republican mayor in 20 years is taking the unruly metropolis by its collar and trying to shake it into greater self-discipline, both fiscal and social. Mr Giuliani, who has just celebrated his first 100 days in office, has been a whirl of policy initiatives - in sharp contrast to the reactive style of his Democratic predecessor, Mr David Dinkins, New York's first black mayor, whom Mr Giuliani narrowly defeated in last November's election. The mayor's reform programme, designed to avert a looming budget crisis and reverse deterioration in the city's 'quality of life', has four main elements. The first is a crackdown on crime under a tough new police chief, Mr William Bratton. For example, police officers on the beat can now arrest drug dealers, rather than leaving this to special narcotics squads. The anti-truancy patrols are designed in part to pinpoint juvenile criminals, whose numbers are growing disturbingly. Second, the mayor wants to reform the school system, which suffers from declining standards, crumbling buildings and rising student violence. While vital, this is a complex task on which he has yet to formulate clear policies. His initial goal - to cut education bureaucracy so more money can flow to schools - is only a partial palliative. Third, he wants to create a more favourable business climate, and has made a modest first step by proposing small cuts in the corporate tax burden. Finally, he is trying to end that longest running of New York shows - the city's recurrent budget crisis - with a reform of its finances, privatisation of services and an efficiency drive. His immediate task is to bridge a potential Dollars 2.3bn budget gap in the year beginning July 1. His remedies include cutting the municipal workforce by 15,000 and wringing productivity concessions out of the unions; consolidating various government departments; and selling off at least four municipal hospitals, 85 petrol stations and a television and radio station. He is also trying to get New York state to assume a fairer proportion of Medicaid, which provides healthcare for the indigent and is one of the largest and fastest growing budget items. The business community sees the budget package as a good start, though some critics argue the mayor has been insufficiently radical, particularly in shielding from cuts the heavily staffed fire and police services, which backed him strongly in November's election. Mr Dean Mead, of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog agency, says the package 'holds promise. I don't see anything in it that is going to change dramatically the economic climate of the city, but it is the beginning of that process'. But along the way, the mayor has stirred up controversy. Many New Yorkers say he has yet to demonstrate the skills of diplomacy and political compromise needed to run the world's most polyglot city smoothly over the long haul. For Mr Giuliani, a 49-year-old former US attorney who made his name in the 1980s with the zealous prosecution of New York drug dealers, mafiosi and Wall Street insider traders, has brought to City Hall the bullying, irascible style of the courtroom interrogator, pouring personal scorn on politicians and civil servants who cross him. The strength of this approach was shown at the start of this month, when he pressurised the normally bellicose municipal unions into accepting voluntary redundancies. Its weakness was underlined a week ago, when his interference and insults prompted the highly respected head of the schools system briefly to resign. The new mayor is walking a fine line. As the first Republican mayor of Democratic-dominated New York since the aristocratic Mr John Lindsay in the 1960s, he has few political debts to pay, and therefore has the best chance in a generation of reforming the city's government. But he also needs to talk softly, if he is to win the co-operation of the Democrat-controlled city legislature and municipal agencies. The first real test of the administration's effectiveness will come this spring as Mr Giuliani tries to build a consensus in the legislature for his budget cuts. His predominantly white administration also needs to build bridges to the city's minority communities, particularly the black 25 per cent of the population which supported Mr Dinkins. 'I think he's off to a good start,' says Mr Felix Rohatyn, the veteran banker who helped save the city from a more serious financial crisis in the mid-1970s. 'But it's very important that as soon as possible he be seen as mayor of all the people of the city . . . There are still a lot of racial tensions in New York.' How Mr Giuliani manages this balancing act could have a profound impact on the future of New York, for he has come to office at a delicate point in the city's history: its mounting social and financial problems could mean a slow but inexorable economic decline, while solutions to them could prompt revival. New York is not alone in its problems. Many large cities face budget crises, high crime, an alienated black underclass and a flight of business and the middle class to the suburbs. Nor is it alone in electing a reformist, market-oriented mayor. Over the past year cities as varied as Los Angeles and Jersey City voted in Republicans in place of their traditional Democrats. However, New York does have unique features which set it apart from all other US cities, both exacerbating its problems and offering long-term strengths. On the positive side, the compact nature of Manhattan, its reliable subway system and its cultural attractions means that it has not suffered too badly from 'white flight' to the suburbs. At the other end of the income spectrum, New York retains its allure for new immigrants, who have revitalised some of the city's most decayed sections. 'New York's immigrant-driven culture has given it a ragged energy reminiscent of American cities at the turn of the century,' says Professor Peter Salins, editor of the right-of-centre City Journal. However, the city also has a larger than average quotient of those in need - be they newly landed immigrants, victims of Aids and crack cocaine, the indigent or the deranged. New Yorkers, moreover, have long expected their government to do more than other cities to solve their social problems. The city runs the largest subsidised housing programme in the US, as well as 15 municipal hospitals and an elaborate system of shelters for the homeless. Its bureaucracy is also unusually bloated, thanks to the strength of the municipal union movement and its close ties to the Democratic party machine. Over the past six years, employment by the municipality has risen by 15,000, while a prolonged recession - the result of the 1987 stock market crash and the 1990-91 national downturn - has cut the total number in work in the city by 345,000, or 9.5 per cent. All these factors mean that the city's spending is growing much more sharply than its revenues, which were seriously dented by the recession of 1989-93. Mr Giuliani will be helped by a recovery in the regional economy which began last year, though this looks like being painfully slow, and employment may not recover to pre-recession levels till around the turn of the century. Still, provided New York tackles its 'quality of life' problems, many observers think the city could grow healthily over the coming decades, drawing on what are still immense comparative advantages. It seems in no danger of losing its position as the world's pre-eminent financial hub. That said, it cannot rely on Wall Street for jobs growth. The securities industry has boomed over the past three years, but this has created relatively few new jobs in Manhattan, partly because information technology has increased productivity and partly because companies have moved much of their routine 'back office' paperwork to cheaper cities as far away as Florida. Yet New York remains the single greatest source of creative and intellectual capital in the US and is a leading centre for two of the sectors which seem likely to enjoy particularly strong growth over the next few decades: entertainment/information and international trade. Mr Mitchell Moss, head of the Urban Research Centre at New York University, says the city's competitive, cosmopolitan nature means that 'it is still a phenomenal magnet for the talented'. Mr Giuliani just has to keep it that way.

text:  It is a long time since a senior US official has advised Latin American governments to do what they can to strengthen trade unions. And it is a far cry from the Reagan and Bush years when that same official argues that markets alone, without governments, cannot bring prosperity. Yet this was the message of a powerful speech by Mr Lawrence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary, to the InterAmerican Development Bank last week. His words, if put into action, would have profound implications for Latin America and other developing regions. They also contain some risks. Regional development banks such as the IADB were, he said, 'as important to the new world order as the regional security organisations were to the old one', as the challenge of defeating communism had been replaced by that of sharing prosperity. The development banks certainly have much to recommend them in helping to address social problems that threaten regional prosperity. On its own, however, throwing money at social problems will not work. Nor is there any one blueprint for success in confronting them. And if it goes too far in emphasising government action on social issues, there is a danger that the US administration could help to reinforce rather than to remove obstacles to reform in Latin America. As Mr Summers himself implied, Latin American governments can now begin to address social challenges only because of their improved macroeconomic management and market-oriented reform programmes. The first priority for governments attempting to address unequal income distribution is to tackle inflation which daily widens the gap between rich and poor. As Brazil shows, governments cannot even think about social programmes while suffering four-digit annual inflation. The risk is that the emphasis on social issues will raise conflicts which play into the hands of those wishing to block further necessary reforms. Most Latin American countries already have strong labour laws (though they are unevenly applied) which inhibit competitiveness and benefit those with jobs at the expense of the unemployed. Public-sector trade unions continue to impede reform of bureaucracies, health and education systems. More ominously, the new American emphasis on social ideals has parallels with its stance on labour and environmental standards in trade negotiations. Developing countries may ask what lies behind these arguments. Is the US really worried about conditions of workers in Peru or is it looking to hobble competition from poorer countries? Some of these concerns can be alleviated by the multilateral approach described by Mr Summers. But Washington must take care not to impose its ideas on Latin America. Otherwise, its new drive for social justice in Latin America will be seen as a covert means of pursuing the perceived commercial interests of the US.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Leading Article: Beauty's riches 
text:  It is a truth universally acknowledged - and almost as widely resented - that beauty rarely goes unrewarded. But it has taken the ingenuity of academic economists to put a price on what the world's oldest profession always knew. In a paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research, Messrs Daniel Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle have found that plain people earn 5 to 10 per cent less than people of average looks, while average lookers earn 5 per cent less than those who are good looking. This seems hard on the ugly. Yet those who believe that market forces reflect people's marginal value to society will no doubt say: tough but just. The followers of Friedrich Hayek will, on the other hand, pay a backhanded compliment to the physiologically disadvantaged by declaring that there is no moral merit or demerit attaching to rewards in the labour market. Yet both these camps, which tend to belong on the intellectual right, should be on their guard for a leftish backlash. As long as nobody attempted to quantify the adverse impact of the haphazard distribution of natural endowments, it was possible for us to live with nature's decision to confer fantastic brainpower on Einstein, exceptional tonsils on Pavarotti and a super superstructure on Marilyn Monroe. But with researchers producing extensive physical and economic data from household surveys, we may shortly confront a powerful new interest group seeking redress for physiognomical shortcomings. Mainstream opinion will demand compensation through the tax and benefit system. The left will want subsidies for cosmetic surgery. A suitable euphemism for ugly - homely? - will be sought. There is, of course, a better way. Average-looking people cannot be expected to pay taxes for those of ill mien. A hypothecated tax should therefore be levied on the beautiful in favour of the ugly. The important thing is that beauty must not pay.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Leading Article: Disaster at Gorazde 
text:  Saturday was a black day in the history of both Nato and the United Nations  -the two institutions on which it had seemed possible to build some semblance of world order after the cold war. The debacle at Gorazde is a disaster for Bosnia - one more, after so many. It is a catastrophe for Unprofor, the UN protection force in the former Yugoslavia. Many reputations will be tarnished. Those special envoys who last week were uttering optimistic statements about ceasefires and compromise solutions are left looking irredeemably foolish. A sadder casualty - given the hopes that had been raised by his efforts until last week - is the reputation of Unprofor's commander in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose. For two months General Rose's energy and ingenuity, backed by an apparently firmer sense of purpose among his political masters, had made it seem as if Unprofor was actually capable of carrying out its mandate, and even as if that mandate was clear and coherent. But in truth the mandate remained contradictory. It was often asserted, not least by General Rose himself, that Unprofor was a neutral peacekeeping and humanitarian operation, authorised to use force only in its own defence. Given the size and nature of the units composing it, that was perhaps the only realistic way for its commanders to interpret their mandate. But that interpretation ignored many paragraphs in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, which authorised the use of force not only to ensure that humanitarian aid reached the people who needed it, but also to defend the so-called 'safe areas'. It also ignored the political context in which those resolutions were passed, which was one of worldwide outrage at the violent dismembering of a state. The world at large has not wavered in its judgment that the principal aggressors are the Bosnian Serbs, aided and abetted by Serbia. The Security Council has imposed very tough sanctions on Serbia, and the 'safe areas' it proclaimed were all places still held by the Bosnian government, but threatened by the Serb advance. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Serb forces regarded Unprofor with intense suspicion, especially whenever its commanders showed signs of taking their mandate seriously and being prepared to use force to carry it out. Perhaps if General Rose had been given the extra troops he asked for, he might have succeeded. As it was, the Serbs called his bluff, and he underestimated the gravity of their challenge until it was too late. Then Nato provided 'close air support' at his request, but this was not enough even to protect UN personnel, let alone to protect the 'safe area' of Gorazde and its population. Only a much more intensive air bombardment of Serb forces could have affected the military outcome, and for this there was no stomach either in national capitals or at Unprofor HQ. Logically there are now only two options left. One is for Unprofor to be called out and the Bosnians left to fight their own war, with weapons and perhaps also air cover from sympathetic outsiders. The other is for Unprofor to be massively reinforced and equipped to fight. Neither option is likely to be adopted. The Serbs are in a position to make Unprofor's withdrawal very difficult, and few western governments will be prepared to take responsibility for the likely immediate consequences for Bosnian civilians, who for better or worse have come to depend on the UN humanitarian relief effort. But governments will be even less willing to contemplate an all-out war with the Bosnian Serbs. The sad probability is that Unprofor will stay, becoming ever more constrained in its relief role and in effect serving to ratify the results of Serb aggression. The reality of the new world order is proving very different from the prospectus offered in 1990-91.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Contracting margins: The gloom among UK builders 
text:  Construction output in the UK is rising and companies are returning to profit after record losses. So why do British contractors sound so universally gloomy? Is it that, like the apocryphal farmer, they will never admit to better times, or is the structure of the industry unable to meet the challenges of recovery? Building material companies forecast a 2 per cent rise in construction this year, the first annual increase since 1990. A further rise of 2.5 per cent is predicted for 1995 and again for 1996. A survey by the Chartered Institute of Building claims that the industry hired twice as many permanent staff during the first few months of this year as at the start of 1993. Pay levels have started to rise in some companies as they seek to hold on to remaining staff to cope with the increased work. Montrose Technical Recruitment, one the largest UK construction recruitment consultants, says: 'Registered job vacancies with construction employers have risen by 44 per cent in the first quarter compared with the first three months of last year, while the number of people placed with construction companies is almost double that of the corresponding period last year.' Yet in recent weeks, as chief executives have announced profit figures for last year, their accompanying comments have been almost universally pessimistic. The reason is less the size of their UK order books than the low prices at which they are winning contracts. These leave little or no margin for profit. Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, blames low margins on contractors with high borrowings which need a regular flow of cash payments to meet interest charges; contractors have been bidding for contracts 'at the expense of profit'. He also criticises banks and institutional shareholders which, he says, support 'enfeebled contractors' and add to damaging over-capacity in the construction industry. His company, which announced a 57 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.3m, estimates that over-capacity in the industry is running at about 30 per cent. By contrast, building material companies have been much more successful in cutting capacity. Over-capacity has led to a fall in prices at which contractors win jobs, by 22 per cent since 1989; but list prices for building materials and labour have risen by 21 per cent according to EC Harris, the construction cost consultancy. Some of the difference between tender prices and costs will have been made up by claims for additional payments to meet 'unforeseen' design changes which traditionally arise after contracts have been signed. EC Harris also says there is evidence of a pick-up in construction tender prices of about 2.5 per cent since last summer. Even so, margins are likely to remain paper thin, with increases in the prices charged by building material producers and sub-contractors likely to offset any rise in tender prices. Even if tender prices were to rise sharply they might not affect published earnings figures for another two years or more because of the time lag before profits from projects are included in accounts, says Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation. Lead contractors are also being squeezed on another front. Part of their profit comes from advance payments from customers. These are held on account, earning interest, until they are passed on to sub-contractors. Falling interest rates reduce this income. As in many industries, sub-contractors complain about the length of time it takes for main contractors to make payments - another sign of cash problems. Laing's forthright comments about banks' support for weaker companies have angered some rivals. Concerns about over-capacity, however, are shared by senior executives in other companies. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, the international construction company which last year made pre-tax profits of just Pounds 21m on a turnover of Pounds 2.18bn, says the industry is in need of rationalisation. Some are better placed than others: housebuilders, for instance, which are leading the sector out of recession. Sales are rising and margins have begun to improve as prices increase and builders use up expensive land bought in the late 1980s. There is nevertheless concern that land prices, which have risen by up to 50 per cent in the south-east during the past 12 months, could slow the pace of future earnings recovery. Public spending cuts, particularly on roads, could also restrict growth in the industry. Given these concerns, there can be little surprise that building shares, which have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by more than a fifth in the past 12 months, have looked more vulnerable in recent weeks.

So it comes as less than a complete surprise that Maurice Doyle, the Irish central bank president who played a prime role in formulating exchange rate policy during the crisis, will not be running for a second term of office. Finance minister Bertie Ahern, now mulling over a shortlist of candidates to take on the job from the end of this month, had been especially careful to praise Doyle's 'great professionalism'. But last Friday, introducing a new five pound note, an impish Ahern rounded off his speech by thanking Doyle for his 'sterling service to the bank and to the nation'.

text:  Is France limbering up for candidacy as a semi-detached member of the European Union? One might be forgiven for thinking so after the French delegation's antics at last week's signing of the Gatt agreement, which made the normally bolshy Brits look like positively model European citizens. French industry minister Gerard Longuet's first task in Marrakesh was to break ranks with his fellow Europeans by presuming to speak for all 12 countries during private talks with Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's special trade representative. Next, he insisted that EU governments append their names separately, instead of signing and sealing the great document 'en bloc' as previously agreed. The final straw was when Longuet provoked an emergency EU council meeting, and promptly headed back to Paris. When he finally reappeared, 11 hungry ministers, who had spent an evening without sustenance, marched out en masse. Hence, by the weekend, the only delegate in Marrakesh with a good word for the French was Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's trade commiss-ioner. No doubt that is down to Brittan's good-humoured patience, and is quite unrelated to his bid for the Commission presidency, for which French support is crucial.

text:  All those Wall Street houses assiduously courting Jose Angel Gurria, Mexico's chief debt negotiator through the 1980s, will have to call it a day  -for now. The flamboyant former finance ministry official, who has graced many a headhunter's list since he wrapped up the debt negotiations in 1990, has signalled that his considerable ambitions are currently focused on the domestic political scene. Over the weekend, he bowed out as head of the state development bank and joined the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party as secretary for international affairs. Battling along after the assassination of its presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI faces a plummeting stock market and rising interest rates. So there's no doubt it needs an effective spokesman to calm foreign concerns about Mexico's future. Fluent in at least four languages, the invariably good-humoured Gurria has charmed scores of financiers over the years. But even he, with his remarkable ability to sell a story in the worst circumstances, may be hard pushed to promote the PRI effectively. If he succeeds, and the party wins the August election, the prize should be a top job in the next administration. If not, the sirens of Wall Street will surely beckon once again.

text:  Sir, Your editorial 'Paying for parties' (April 14) supports the recommendations in Labour's minority report on the funding of political parties that shareholders should be balloted on company donations. When your reporter pressed Sir Ivan Lawrence at the launch of both Conservative majority and Labour minority reports as to why this measure was not included in the majority report, he pooh-poohed the idea, suggesting it was not necessary and would be far too complicated for companies to administer. This is a poor excuse. Our minority report calls for exactly the same regulations which apply to political donations from trade unions to be applied to companies. In other words, that companies wishing to make political donations should establish a political fund approved by shareholders every 10 years, and that provision should be made for shareholders who do not wish to contribute to opt out. Unless such a recommendation was implemented in law the position is clearly not going to change. A recent survey by Pensions and Investment Research Consultants found boards defending their decisions not to consult shareholders by claiming donations are 'falling within the remit the management, not the shareholders' (Smith Kline Beecham) and 'a matter for the board' (Glaxo). Where shareholders are 'consulted' the methods are often not a model of democracy: Allied Lyons told the survey that the 'mood' of the annual meeting was in favour of a donation, 'judging from the applause which met the chairman's comments'. This is an issue around which democrats in all parties should unite. It is a pity that Conservative members of the home affairs select committee have shown so little regard for democracy and openness. Barbara Roche, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / The Bretton Woods twins at 50: America 
text:  The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have every reason to celebrate their 50th anniversary this July. Of course they have made some bad loans and shown insensitivity on some issues, such as poverty relief and the environment. But critics should remember that these institutions, on the whole, championed the right causes. They advocated free markets and conservative macroeconomics when such policies were reviled by the developing (and developed) world's intelligentsia. Yet at this moment of triumph the future of the Bretton Woods twins is murky. Over the next 50 years the power and prestige of these agencies - and many like them - is likely to decline. This should not be read as a criticism of their mostly able and dedicated staff. It will instead reflect profound changes in the economic landscape - changes that are already beginning to reduce the demand for their bureaucratic services. The fund and bank, admittedly, have adapted skilfully to changing circumstances. The fund no longer supervises a fixed exchange rate system (because that long ago vanished) nor is it concerned solely with short-term macro stabilisation. The bank has long ceased to be simply a supplier of project finance. Today, both institutions are engaged in 'policy-based' lending; both are trying to promote structural reforms; both are concerned with long-term development. This suggests a clearer division of labour and some rationalisation of functions is possible, as the independent Bretton Woods Commission is likely to recommend later this year. But a 50th anniversary year review of their operations ought to dig a little deeper. The fund and bank, I would argue, are engaged in three distinct activities: the provision of economic advice; the supply of development capital; and the certification of policies as sound or unsound. All three activities are separable, and all three can, in principle, be provided by the private sector. On advice, there is now broad agreement on the market-friendly policies likely to promote development. Private consultants are perfectly capable of devising economic reform strategies for developing and formerly communist countries. Meanwhile, the lifting of controls on capital flows and the growth of pension funds and other forms of institutional investment in rich countries has created a huge pool of mobile private capital. From a trickle in the early 1980s, total private flows to developing countries have become a torrent, worth about Dollars 110bn last year. They look durable because the bulk is long-term equity and bond finance. Foreign direct investment is now the single largest source of capital for developing countries, rather than official aid or loans, which have stagnated. Despite this revolution, agencies such as the fund and bank claim to have a critical role even in the middle-income countries that can so easily attract private capital. They say they are uniquely well placed to influence economic policies - and thus promote development - because they can make loans conditional on policy changes. By serving as scapegoats, they claim they can also provide political cover for unpopular but essential domestic reforms. There is something in this conditionality argument. The fund and bank can doubtless point to instances where reform would not have occurred but for their prodding. But as the fund's problems in Russia illustrate, the leverage of external agencies is pretty limited in the absence of a domestic consensus for reform. The long list of perpetual borrowers from the fund and bank illustrates the dark side of policy-based lending. Governments promise to make reforms in order to get loans, and then renege on their promises. After a cooling-off period, the process repeats itself. The fund and bank thus become unwitting obstacles to reform; their loans enable countries to pursue rotten policies for longer than would otherwise be the case. Trying to be kind, they create more, rather than less, misery. The private sector alternative seems far cleaner. If a country wants to implement market-oriented reforms, it can buy the necessary advice privately. Once it has proved its good faith, bankers and private investors will be clamouring at its doors. And it is not true, as some sceptics argue, that private investors are willing to risk their shirts only in relatively prosperous countries already under the tutelage of the bank and fund. The example of China, which attracted more than Dollars 20bn in private inflows last year, shows that countries with very low per capita incomes can attract private capital without an official badge certifying good behaviour. Yet the bank and fund are still needed. Even in a liberal global economic order, governments must co-ordinate policies, so as to avoid destabilising shifts in fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy. There will still be financial emergencies, such as the debt crisis of the early 1980s. It is in these spheres, rather than conditional lending, that the fund has most to offer. The bank, meanwhile, should accept that many of its historic tasks can now be performed by private bodies; a slimmed-down agency should focus its energies on the poorest regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where the outlook for private investment is bleakest. What the fund and bank can no longer deny is that the growing competence of the private sector in all aspects of development finance logically requires a tighter definition of their role. Public agencies, as they have long argued, exist to perform tasks that the private sector either cannot do at all, or cannot do well.

text:  Sir, Your leader 'Sizing up the watchdogs' (April 15) argues the case for moderation in changing regulatory regimes of the energy, water and telecommunications industries. For the most part, I would agree with you and with Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, that an evolutionary approach is preferable to some more extreme ideas now being suggested. I also agree that an all powerful regulatory giant, sitting astride the whole process, would be highly undesirable. If anything, we should be aiming to dilute the current concentration of power in regulatory hands rather than adding to it. In particular, it would be wrong to lump in telecommunications with the utilities. Telecommunications regulation is a transitional process, while competitors establish themselves in what is now a fully open market. We already have a decade of experience behind us. The utilities are relatively recent arrivals on the scene and their regulation can be expected to be a permanent feature, as there will always be a strong element of monopoly in their markets. Oftel provided the original experiment in UK regulation and there is an opportunity to use it again to blaze the trail for the next stage of regulatory evolution. There are a number of reasons why a judicious review of the Oftel framework would be timely. First, 10 years without any review is a long time. Second, it is becoming increasingly clear that separate regulation of telecommunications and broadcasting makes little sense when the two industries are evidently converging. Third, a framework designed essentially to cater for a duopoly in telecommunications sits uncomfortably in a market with a multiplicity of participants. A review of Oftel for these reasons would offer the government the opportunity, at the same time, to try out some of the more sensible proposals for reform that are now being advocated - such as more explicit regulatory objectives, greater transparency, less concentration of power in one individual, and possibly even a 'short cut' review procedure at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But, as Sir Bryan wisely counsels, such a review should reinforce and not undermine the current separation of powers between regulator and department of state.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / The alluring call of the Buddha: Religious loyalties exercise increasing influence in Japanese politics 
text:  Politics and religion have often been uncomfortably close in Japan. And the two estates are getting closer these days, to the alarm of many in a country whose postwar constitution imposes a broad but imprecise ban on religions exercising political authority. Japan's largest and richest religious organisation, the Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai, is a significant, yet poorly understood, behind-the-scenes force in the political upheavals likely to lead to the formation of a new Japanese government this week. Founded 64 years ago as a pacifist protest against state Shinto ritual, Soka Gakkai is now part of the political establishment as the power behind Komeito, the clean government party. Komeito's partnership with the conservative Japan Renewal Party dominates policy in the fragmented seven-party coalition. Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal Party, is a potential successor to former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa - though the outcome is unclear. Formally, Soka Gakkai and Komeito are separate organisations, but their links run deep: all but six of Komeito's 76 members of parliament belong to Soka Gakkai and use its 1,000 community centres to address the faithful during election campaigns. Komeito's opponents in the opposition Liberal Democratic party suspect that Mr Daisaku Ikeda, Soka Gakkai's 66-year-old leader and founder of Komeito 30 years ago, still runs his old party from behind the scenes. Mr Ikeda, author of more than 60 spiritual tomes, is portrayed by critics as a billionaire megalomaniac. He was forced to demerge Komeito and Soka Gakkai in 1970. Komeito was then the political department of Soka Gakkai and Mr Ikeda was alleged to run both as personal fiefs. But Soka Gakkai's wealth still makes it an attractive political friend. Political parties badly need new non-corporate backers because of a law curbing the size of political donations from any one source. Soka Gakkai's most avid suitor is the wily Mr Ichiro Ozawa, deputy head of the JRP. His opponents accuse him of using his alliance with Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito secretary-general - dubbed the 'Ichi-ichi line' in Japan's press - to dominate the coalition. Soka Gakkai's attractions are obvious. The sect and its affiliates own a daily newspaper with a circulation of 5.5m and a gravestone business, and it has established its own university. The newspaper, Seikyo Simbun, the sect's biggest cash source, reported a Y9.4bn (Pounds 62m) profit in 1991. The group is, however, shy about divulging its precise income. Soka Gakkai's influence also derives from its following among the spiritually inclined in Japan's armies of salarymen. Its membership - about 8m households in Japan and 1.3m abroad - makes it the most successful of the half-dozen new religions to have grown over the past few decades by offering a community and spiritual dimension to city dwellers who feel their lives lack depth. Mr Ikeda's officials are baffled at their movement's controversial public image. They insist its influence is benignly ethical and deny it finances any political party. Yet they accept its increased influence imposes new responsibilities: they have to offer a clearer vision for Japan than a bland diet of universal harmony. Here, the main influence is Mr Einosuke Akiya, Soka Gakkai's president and a close friend of Mr Ikeda. 'Religion is the underlying current in human life . . . so there is going to be some kind of involvement in politics, based on religious ideas,' he says. There is nothing new in this, he adds. Three years ago, Komeito helped the former LDP government win parliamentary agreement to send peacekeepers to help the United Nations in Cambodia. Mr Akiya wants Japan to play a greater role under a UN-based international system, on which he is deliberately vague. But he has clearer views on development aid. 'Japan must do more than merely provide international aid to satisfy its obligations to the world community,' he says. It must discuss aid projects with recipients, and send more aid workers into the field. The sect does not, however, plan to impose a parliamentary whip on Komeito members, he says. It does not have to. At least one Diet member has found offending Mr Ikeda left him no option but to resign. Komeito politicians see no constitutional problem in bringing Buddhism to politics - if the party and sect stay institutionally separate. 'Yes, Soka Gakkai supports us electorally, but Komeito handles its own political business,' says Mr Akihiro Ohta, Komeito's vice-secretary general. Dr Masami Kita, economics professor at Soka University, likens the relationship with Komeito to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland's support for the Labour Party in the 19th century. 'Soka Gakkai members are awakening to their political responsibilities and exercising their political rights,' he says. The benefits to Komeito of the relationship are clear. It regularly pulls in 7m votes at general elections and is rarely defeated in any seat on which it can afford to concentrate resources. Its election candidates address the faithful at the end of monthly Soka Gakkai worship sessions. Their speeches usually follow a simulcast talk over a central television screen in each of the sect's community centres by Mr Ikeda, offering moral guidance from the lives of a wide range of figures from Beethoven to Napoleon. Part of Soka Gakkai's appeal, say members, is to bring spiritual freedom to people who feel oppressed, as did its two founders, who were jailed as 'thought criminals' for challenging the monopoly of state Shinto of the 1930s. The movement expanded fast after the second world war, under Mr Ikeda's leadership. Another surge came in the 1960s from the first generations of salarymen, often sent to Tokyo to live in company dormitories away from their families. Soka Gakkai even went to the trouble of providing a laundry service for the faithful. But Soka Gakkai's membership has stagnated in recent years. New religious converts have flocked to younger fringe groups, such as the ultra-nationalist Institute for Research into Human Happiness, or to Agon-shu, which uses its own satellite television station to blast healing psychic power at the faithful. Even before the recent spiritual revival, the Japanese showed a unique capacity to follow several faiths at once, suggesting a dilettante approach to religion which could rebound on Soka Gakkai. At last count, the government's cultural affairs agency knew of 231,000 Japanese religious sects with 215m members - more than 1 1/2 times the nation's population of 124m. Soka Gakkai's inability to benefit more from this religious revival may result partly from the damage to its image when a safe belonging to a former director of its newspaper, containing Y175m, was found discarded on a Yokohama rubbish dump in 1989. The coalition government even felt it necessary three months ago to make a small increase in the low tax rate on religious groups' business profits, in response to public criticism of the tax privileges allowed to Soka Gakkai and other rich movements. The sect's image may equally have been harmed by its mass excommunication three years ago from the 700-year-old Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist sect on which its teachings are based. Mr Ikeda's followers had accused the Nichiren monks of 'playing golf and living madly spendthrift lives'. Mr Akiya is undismayed and likens the split to Christian protestants' breakaway from the Catholic church. 'We have been liberated,' he says. Despite its ambivalent public profile, Soka Gakkai will be part of Japanese public life for some time. It is so powerful that the wobbly coalitions likely to run Japan for the foreseeable future cannot afford to offend it.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Arts: The Boy Friend is back - Musical theatre 
text:  It survived Ken Russell, complete with fantasy sequences and orchestrations by Peter Maxwell Davies. Now at an age when demure discretion is expected, Sandy Wilson's ersatz 1920s frivolity taps, charlestons and high-kicks its enchanting way through a fortieth birthday season at the little theatre under the Charing Cross arches where it first saw the light of post-austerity day. Forty-first, to be precise, but who would be so ungallant as to point out that the first, short version of this flapper-age pastiche appeared in 1953, while the full-length edition for the West End dates from January 1954? In a time of sexual equality, boyfriends, like girlfriends, are presumably entitled to arithmetical discretion. In fact the new production by Maria Charles, the first Dulcie, has wrought a certain old D'Oyly Cartery on the piece, apparently recreating the original down to the last squeal and flounce. Not that there is much else you can do with the show, a perfect crystallisation of sweet, silly 1920s musicals perceived from a viewpoint part nostalgic, part amused, wholly affectionate. The songs ('I could be happy with you', 'A room in Bloomsbury', 'It's never too late to fall in love') could be taken for the authentic period product. Disley Jones's bright designs are framed by a rose-clustered trellis. The Villa Caprice Finishing School is rightly dominated by Judith Bruce's Madame Dubonnet, her fractured Anglo-Gallic diphthongs indicating kinship with Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau. She strikes the right blend of involvement and ironic detachment - for all its resilience, the piece needs a delicate stylistic balance. I remember a Bristol Old Vic production somewhat overwhelmed by Eleanor Bron's conviction that she was the funniest thing on stage. As the millionaire's lovelorn daughter Polly Browne, Gemma Page has the right whitish, genteel English light soprano, very authentic. Unlike Twiggy in the film, she refrains from tap-dancing, but Oliver Hickey as Tony (messenger-boy-cum-fugitive-from-the-peerage) dashingly makes up for it. Occasionally one guiltily yearns for Ken Russell's forbidden, and over-ripe, fruit: Jane Stoggles' jolly French maid is in the Hattie Jacques rather than the Barbara Windsor tradition. State education has left us with enunciation less Coward of Mayfair than Heath of Broadstairs ('If Mme Dubonnet feound eout I'd be asked to leave under a cleoud') but for the most part the shrill cut-glass accents pass for diamonds. Wilson's rhymes strike one yet again with their insouciant ingenuity, well up to Cole Porter standard ('I don't claim that I am psychic/But one look at you and I kick/Away every scruple/I learnt as a pupil/In school, my dear'). The band (piano, percussion, bass) is under the direction of Geoffrey Brawn, almost as much an institution as The Boy Friend itself. The Boy Friend, Players' Theatre, London.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Arts: A language for the Zulu Tolstoys - Novelist Justin Cartwright asks if art must be a political weapon in the new South Africa 
text:  Up on the slopes of Table Mountain, looking across the Cape Flats towards the distant purplish mountains, Cape Town University is blessed with a beautiful campus in a unique setting. The main buildings are built in local stone; a large figure of Cecil Rhodes gazes north from a comfortable sitting position. From the arts block, home to John Coetzee and Andre Brink, this view is marred on closer inspection by the sprawl of the townships and squatter camps which starts just at the point where the suburbs end and the wind-swept flatlands begin. It stretches as far as the eye can see along the once pristine sweep of False Bay. The university and the Cape Peninsula are now separated from the rest of the country by an isthmus of misery. It is not surprising with this reminder of the true state of the nation, this painful contrast between the serene university and the squalid townships, that teachers of the arts are suffering a crisis of identity. No academic I spoke to has come to terms with the role of culture in the new South Africa. With people dying in ever-increasing numbers and a grim realisation that the new South Africa may in some ways be worse than the old, the cultural debate has urgency but little cogency. One of South Africa's finest essayists, Stephen Watson, describes his feelings one day as he was preparing to lecture at the university: 'I was forced to realise with a feeling akin to vertigo . . . that I no longer knew what I was saying.' Watson found himself overwhelmed by the conflicting claims of university as ivory tower and as 'site of struggle'. In some degree every academic in the old, white, universities has suffered this confusion. The reasons, apart from the sheer scale of the deprivation, are not hard to understand. Saul Bellow famously asked: where is the Zulu Tolstoy? Here the questions are, if there is a Zulu Tolstoy, how is he going to come to our notice? In what language is he going to be published? What - white - academic is going to unearth him? And what Scandinavian country is going to subsidise his airfares to international seminars? A number of academics suggested to me that their work in township poetry, drama and workshops was their justification for continuing to teach English literature. Others have shied away from any notion of relevance. The relevance of JM Coetzee's bleak novels to the South African predicament could hardly be greater, yet his work is coded and freed of partisan content by being set in placeless and timeless shadowlands. Nadine Gordimer, by contrast, believes in direct participation in the cultural and political struggles, both as sponsor of the Congress of South African Writers and ANC member. Her writing, too, is clearly set in time and place. If she is sanguine about the prospect of the ANC becoming just another political party, others find it difficult to accept that they should now show allegiance to a party after years of fighting for principles. But while hundreds of people are dying each week, it is perhaps unsurprising that the coercive language of progressive thinking is flourishing. In some quarters the term 'cultural worker' is used without irony to describe anyone in the arts or teaching fields. That this demonstrates a fondness for the language of totalitarianism, seems not to worry the ideologues. There is, of course, resistance to the notion, expressed by the ANC's cultural department, that the refusal to take sides is itself a form of taking sides. As Watson says, no artist, indeed no man, is obliged to give up his freedom by speaking in the language of the day. This is quite a different issue from the poet Jeremy Cronin's plea in his poem To Learn How To Speak that South African writers must 'learn how to speak with the voices of the land'. The one is a legacy of seminars in Eastern Bloc countries, the other is an artistic desire to find a new South African voice. At the heart of the marriage between ANC and communists is a historical compromise which makes it difficult to know where the new government will stand on many issues. The Marxist element finds culture itself suspect. Something in its very nature is seen to be elitist. This leads to some dangerously nave conclusions. The Zulu Tolstoys should not be discriminated against just because they cannot write English. Some way must be found for liberating their writing from the hegemony of colonial language. (Colonialism is a protean term. It covers anything which smacks of Eurocentrism. One lecturer told me that if she wants to attract an audience for Jane Austen she includes the word in her description of the course: Jane Austen, colonial norms in pre-feminist society.) And because the townships were, as Watson says, the crucibles of resistance, it is logical to believe that the most responsive art will emerge there. There is little evidence that this is so. Indeed, with the exodus to the suburbs of the educated it is unlikely ever to come to pass. Thanks to the struggle and Bantu Education, no major black literary figures have emerged since the generations of Lewis Nkosi and Wally Serote. Real progress, Nadine Gordimer says, has been made in the theatre where black actors are highly influential. The Market Theatre of Johannesburg has earned a reputation worldwide for its invigorating and challenging productions. Albie Sachs, the lawyer and ANC activist who was maimed in a car bombing in Mozambique in 1988, caused a furore by suggesting in an ANC discussion paper that culture was not a weapon of the struggle. Perhaps in his travels he saw too much of socialist realism. The way he puts it is: 'We (the ANC) want to give leadership to the people, not exercise control over them.' The counter argument, sometimes explicit, often implicit, is that all hands are required at the pumps. One poet suggested to me that while artists have personal freedom, they must study the struggle and learn from it. She seemed not to have considered the possibility that there could be more than one outcome of the prescribed study. The protagonists are going to have something to get their teeth into the moment the issue of the theatrical and ballet companies and symphony orchestras is addressed by the new structures. ('Structures' is a word you cannot avoid in South Africa at the moment.) The bulk of government arts funding has gone into huge, ugly buildings housing these companies. Largely white audiences go to see largely white musicians and dancers performing the works of dead, white males. Sachs himself claims to have attended the Cape Town Symphony every Thursday religiously since his return in 1991 but he cannot see how the massive subsidies to foreign musicians can be maintained. A scramble for realignment is going on, with the old organisations trying desperately to prove their credentials. For example, the strangely embalmed Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal has instituted creative workshops and appointed a black director for the Windybrow Theatre. Township theatre groups have sprung up. Oral poets are being published. Northern Transvaal woodcarvers have many new admirers. Behind this nervous quadrille are worrying questions: Who is to be the arbiter of taste? Who is to decide what is subsidised and what is dependent upon the free market? Is it to be the ANC's cultural department, or is it to be an independent Arts Council? To some this is as important an issue as whether or not the new government will attempt to force the economy along statist lines. It is an issue, like so much else in South Africa, which will depend on which tendency of the ANC triumphs in the next five years.

text:  The first monarch to bear the name of Windsor, so shrewd about the burgerlich values to be projected via such mass media as the rapidly spreading wireless, was woefully deficient in warmth and communicativeness in his immediate circle. His posterity have unconsciously had their revenge on the patriarch by using the mass media to undermine the image of familial propriety. Snoo Wilson's new play at Theatre Clwyd, Mold, off to Glasgow in three weeks, reminds us of the scandal that rocked the dynasty over half a century ago. It also emphasises how lucky we were to be rid of Edward VIII. On a circular dais, like the face of giant sun-dial, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor pace out their gilded exile in wartime governorship of the Bahamas. Given Wilson's fizzingly imaginative way with history (he has a notable arabesque on Shakespeare and Elizabeth I to his credit), we expect an irreverent, perhaps surreal, bagatelle. In fact we get a duologue full of the sort of anecdote, reminiscence and explanation inevitable with historical subjects, smacking of research but only occasionally igniting theatrically. Wallis resents David's abdication. He adores her in a helpless, nice but dim sort of way. She is obsessed to the point of paranoia by other people's animosity, corroded by Britain's refusal to accord her royal status. David has entrusted a shady businessman with Nazi sympathies with Dollars 2m; and the first act ends with the murder of local millionaire, Sir Harry Oakes. There follows a hypothetical explanation of the Duke's historical blunder in summoning police help from Miami without informing American or British authorities. None of this is especially gripping since we know little of the other characters. The play has little point beyond reiterating that David was in sexual thrall to Wallis. Giles Havergal's direction can do little with such a static piece beyond sit the two characters down or stand them up, facing different directions. Maria Aitken elaborately opens and closes her legs and stylishly delivers the work's one flight of fancy, a dream combining images of sex and wealth. David Yelland, pudgily resembling the Duke, grovels at her feet with a slightly too plummy voice: royals then sounded less posh than BBC announcers. Theatre Clwyd, Mold Box office: 0352 755114

text:  George Eliot (1819-1880) confided to a friend in 1860: 'the Mill is not even on the Floss.' By the same token, at the Oxford Playhouse, the Shared Experience touring production of The Mill on the Floss is nowhere near Eliot. But it is no less enjoyable for that, and makes a laudable attempt at a difficult task. The play starts with Maggie Tulliver reading about witches and drowning. This sets the tone for Maggie's unconventional life and watery death. Then follows the familiar story of the fall of the house of Tulliver, the death of Maggie's father, her venal aunts and uncles, her love for the son of the man who ruined her family, and her passionate affair with her cousin's fiancee. And a river runs through it. Eliot works on the page and on film but not on stage because she needs a fixed point of view - one narrator or one camera. The theatre has too many possibilities. Shared Experience solved the technical problems better in their recent Anna Karenina and A Handful of Dust by giving the actors some of the narrative, allowing them to introduce each other. But here, the first half is a jumbled sequence of events which would be hard to follow without some Eliot pre-history. The second half works better because the characters are known. Eliot was more interested in abstracts than this production allows. She was a Victorian agony aunt, having her characters speak truths about their situation and ours: 'Being unhappy can become a bad habit.' Eliot's world is all duties, ties and promises, the invisible bonds that make a community. And that way of seeing life works better in print than on stage. However, the production brilliantly has three Maggies: rebellious child, pious young woman and passionate, sensitive adult making a prime time Freudian tripartite personality. She would be a cert for Oprah Winfrey: 'And what was the child in you telling you to do at that time?' Shirley Henderson (young Maggie) is a fine actor; she brings poise, passion and just enough idiosyncrasy to the part. Around her, Simeon Andrews as her father and Ian Puleston-Davies as the brother who grows into him are both solid; Helen Schlesinger as the adult Maggie is a riot of indecision. She gives the lie to anyone who thinks Eliot cannot be presented sexily. Elsewhere the acting is surer than the slippy regional accents, which will hamper the proposed European tour. The set is commendably succinct  - a stripped-out mill interior with ropes and grain sacks; and the costumes are a delight, especially when Maggie casts off the penitential blue serge and steps into a wicked black lace evening gown for a fateful charity ball. Nancy Meckler and Polly Teale direct Helen Edmundson's adaptation. They have taken on a difficult task, and have done better work with other adaptations. But that is George Eliot's fault.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / The Monday Interview: Henderson in from the cold - The man at the centre of Britain's arms-for-Iraq trial re-enters the business arena 
text:  Paul Henderson, the businessman at the heart of Britain's Iraqgate affair, was not easy to single out amid the clutter of the workaday exhibits at a UK machine tools fair in Birmingham last week. But his anonymity - sitting in the temporary stand numbered 3056 in the huge exhibition hall - belied how much he has learned about how to promote himself when he needs to. On the day John Major, the prime minister, visited the fair, Henderson - silver-haired and with the looks of an ageing television soap opera actor - chose to announce he was setting up a business partnership with John Butcher, the Tory MP and former junior minister for trade and industry. Henderson's resurrection from what had seemed business oblivion is not without its ironies. Butcher's assessment of his partner as a patriotic, unfairly maligned businessman conflicts directly with that of Lord Trefgarne, another former trade minister. It was Trefgarne who, in a public hearing on the arms-for-iraq inquiry held by Lord Justice Scott at the end of March, accused Henderson of lying. With his new venture - the takeover of welding company Production Systems International - Henderson hopes to return to the business mainstream he was suddenly ejected from when in February 1991 he was charged with breaking government export regulations. He was no stranger to publicity. In the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Henderson had already raised eyebrows as the managing director of Matrix Churchill, the Midlands-based machine tool company under Iraqi ownership. The case against him, which collapsed, was that Matrix Churchill broke export regulations by supplying Iraq with machine tools destined to help make arms. During the trial in November 1992 Henderson's defence lawyers revealed he had worked for British intelligence. The government is still counting the cost of the ill-fated legal action. Later this week Henderson's solicitor plans to present the arms-for-Iraq inquiry with further evidence that British officials were involved in approving the export to Iraq of dual-use machine tools capable of military applications. Since the trial found him not guilty, the 57-year-old businessman has been a thorn in the flesh of government and Whitehall. Much of the evidence heard at subsequent public hearings appears to have strengthened the public perception that the Matrix Churchill trial should never have taken place. 'I've met a wide spectrum of people since the Scott inquiry got under way, complete strangers who have come up to me and said how absolutely disgusted they are by what the government did,' says Henderson. Allies like his new business partner portray him as a patriot and unfairly maligned businessman. His detractors - and it is not surprising that there are many within Whitehall - see him as a publicity seeker. He has attended the Scott inquiry on and off as a member of the public, never always making himself available for comment on evidence relating to his case. Such exposure has put pressures on his family life but he says his availability to the media is part of a personal crusade to bring to light the injustice and double-dealing of a government system to which he had always felt loyal. He counts among his favourite family portraits that of his son David, a soldier of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards being presented to the Queen at a royal cocktail party. Certainly Henderson adopts a disarmingly straightforward manner when he describes the most controversial aspect of his working life: his recruitment by the British intelligence services. 'I agreed to work for the intelligence services for two reasons,' he says. 'The first was the glamour . . . the second was simply, if I could help my country why not? In all honesty, at that stage the glamour aspect was more attractive to me than the patriotism.' An MI6 officer code-named Balsom, who was Henderson's controller, has described him as an 'extremely brave man'. Balsom says: 'Few people I have met would take such risks and take them so much in their stride, with all the pressures on them.' Yet Henderson believes the intelligence services betrayed him as much as any other government department. He may once have got a kick out of leading a double life, but today he regrets his recruitment. 'When intelligence services get involved with businessmen, they must be prepared to account for their actions. What I have learnt out of all this is something I would have preferred not to have learnt: that the British government I believed in was duplicitous.' Yet there are very different accounts of Henderson's behaviour. In his evidence to Scott, Lord Trefgarne described a meeting he had with Henderson to establish exactly what Matrix Churchill was selling to the Iraqis: 'I don't think I could have done more than look him in the eye and ask him what the machine tools were for. He told me. I now believe he deceived me.' Those who have distanced themselves from Henderson in recent months include Mark Gutteridge, his former business partner. Gutteridge has not only severed business links, but has kept a personal distance from Henderson in recent months. Businessmen within the machine tool industry are angry about the negative publicity British exporters have received in the Matrix Churchill trial and the Scott inquiry. Henderson's business venture announced last week has been treated with scepticism. 'Henderson is a salesman, not a businessman,' commented one executive. Many will be watching closely to see whether he has the skills to build up the small welding group which only broke even last year.

text:  'There's never been a problem I don't like solving,' said Gerald Greenwald, chairman-designate of United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, last week. 'And I like working with human nuance.' It is just as well: for as boss of an airline that has been targeted for the world's biggest-ever employee buy-out, the 58-year-old former Chrysler vice-chairman could find himself facing problems and nuances a-plenty in his new role. Under a deal hammered out by United's management and labour unions - but yet to be approved by shareholders - the airline's employees have agreed to big pay cuts and other labour concessions in return for a controlling stake in the company. It is a bold endeavour, but nobody knows quite how worker control will pan out. Who, for example, is to say that employees will not cripple the company by voting themselves big pay rises once they have a foot in the boardroom door? Greenwald, the unions' nominee for the chairmanship, clearly relishes the challenge ahead. In a New York presentation aimed at selling the deal to United's shareholders, he spoke repeatedly in terms of making history with the buy-out. In one sense, history has already turned full circle. Four years ago Greenwald was heir apparent to Lee Iacocca as Chrysler's chairman when he abruptly left the car maker to head an earlier union buy-out plan at United. That buy-out collapsed, however, leaving Greenwald to join Dillon Read, a Wall Street investment bank, before going on to head the restructuring of Olympia &amp; York Developments, the failed Canadian property development group. Now established as a bit of a trouble-shooter, Greenwald is currently chairman of Tetra, a Czech Republic truck company, where he has been retained until February 1995 to turn the company around. But United is where he really belongs, he says, even though he has no previous airline experience. He must be spending many a quiet hour praying that United's shareholders agree.

The company, traditionally strong in inventing products but not always as successful at selling them, will appoint Cornelis Boonstra, former president and chief operating officer of Sara Lee, the US-based food and personal products group, to the head of its lighting operations in the summer. Boonstra, a 56-year-old Dutchman, will also join the management board and look after activities in the Asia-Pacific Region. Boonstra, whose abrupt departure from Sara Lee in January came as a complete surprise, is scheduled to replace Einar Kloster, who is stepping down from lighting in July to return to his native Norway. Significantly, however, Boonstra will be given a place on the board, expanding its membership to six directors. Kloster, a scion of Norway's Kloster shipping family who spent more than 30 years with Philips, never belonged to the management board, though he did sit on the wider group management committee. The appointment of Boonstra, whose 'heavy-weight' status as a top US corporate executive puts him in the running as a potential heir to Jan Timmer, Philips' president, is part of the group's search for marketing expertise. The move also extends the trend at Philips towards giving top jobs to outsiders with extensive international experience. Earlier, Pierre Everaert, a Belgian-born naturalised American, was coaxed away from the chairmanship of Ahold, the Dutch food retailer with several supermarket chains in the US. Philips also recently announced that Floris Maljers, chairman of the Dutch arm of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch soap-to-margarine manufacturer, will become chairman of the group's supervisory board, a position usually filled by retired Philips executives.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Management: Another string to their bow - Arts managers in search of business skills 
text:  One minute Felix Warnock was playing bassoon in the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. The next he was running it. As general manager he found himself drawing up business plans, budgets and new management structures. It was a far cry from baroque music. The arts is full of people like Warnock, who clamber into management by virtue of being good bassoonists, singers, actors. While lawyers and accountants also become senior managers on the basis of their skills as practitioners, they tend to be better prepared for their new responsibilities. Arts managers are expected to adapt to their new jobs without outside help. The business school route is closed to them. The cost of a one-week course, around Pounds 2,500, could make the difference for some arts companies between profit and loss. Business in the Arts is attempting to fill the gap with a scheme, sponsored by English Estates, for sending arts managers on management courses. So far nearly 50 managers have been put through the mill, and are now attempting to apply business school recipes to their dance groups, orchestras, theatres, galleries and museums. Budget reductions over the last decade have meant that arts organisations have needed all the management skills on offer. 'There has been a revolution in the last 10 years. No one in the arts is owed a living anymore,' says Barbara Woroncow, director of Yorkshire and Humberside Museums. 'We all need training. Most of us are handling public money. If people had better training they could make better use of the money.' One might have expected some mutual culture shock in plunging an arts manager into the sterile world of the business school. For a start they talk a different language: the average arts manager has never heard of total quality management, and has little idea of what a stakeholder is. Meanwhile, their counterparts in business have no conception of the realities of running a museum or opera company. 'For the first few days I was definitely regarded as an oddity,' says Warnock, who attended the Leadership in Management course at Sundridge Park, Kent. Ian Ritchie, general manager of Opera North, felt that colleagues on his course at Ashridge 'didn't see how somebody like me was actually running a serious business'. But by the end of the week, the similarities between arts companies and a regular business appeared more remarkable than the differences. On the Making Change Work programme, Ritchie and his course-mates agreed that the problems of managing change were similar whether they were selling reinsurance or putting on operas. On the leadership course it emerged that the difficulties of motivating people are the same whether they are musicians or bank clerks. 'The issues they raise are very similar,' says Susan Segal-Horn at the Cranfield School of Management. 'Arts companies need to be able to manage downsizing and outsourcing, to decide where to invest resources and, above all, manage short-term and long-term strategic change. These issues are bog standard. They are the same for Marks &amp; Spencer, for transportation companies, for everyone.' Many arts managers, though, believe their problems are especially tricky. Ritchie argues that Opera North is as complex as a multinational, although he employs only 160 people and has a turnover of just Pounds 9m. He says the financial constraints are especially onerous. 'People were amazed that my annual objective is to achieve breakeven. A swing of 1 per cent means missing the target by Pounds 80,000. Others said they did not have targets that tight.' As well as confirming how difficult their jobs were, the courses provided the arts managers with some concrete help. Woroncow claims to have returned from her strategic management course at Cranfield 'with a missionary zeal'. Her first action was to commission Leeds University Business School to do a customer relations survey of her 180 client museums. She then tore up the existing corporate plan, which she saw to be a muddle of aspirations, and replaced it with precise measurable targets. Next, she signed up for Investors in People. Finally, she took her staff through the exercises she had learnt. 'The course helped me to think in a structured way of the business environment. I had lots of information, but didn't have the tool kit to analyse where changes were coming from, and which were the most important in the short, medium and long term.' Warnock, who since the course has moved sideways to the new position of arts administrator, says his main lesson was the need to listen harder to the views of his colleagues. Ritchie is still hoping to find time to go through the wad of paper he accumulated on the course. Some of the arts managers felt they taught their business colleagues a thing or two. 'The others found my presence refreshing,' says Ritchie. 'I was talking about change in organic terms. One can be very theoretical about techniques of making things happen, but can lose sight of the structure as a fluid thing.' While all enjoyed their week's immersion, they are wary of any trend to elevate general skills of management above those of creativity. Warnock warns that 'management training can be destructive if it is too narrow. There are very few people at London Business School who understand how an orchestra really works. You need 60 people to play a Beethoven symphony. It would seem logical to pare it down, but you can't'

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: When it pays to check your policy 
text:  If you were dispatched on a business trip at an hour's notice, would your medical bills be covered if you had an accident? Even if you were given more notice, would you check the cover offered by company travel insurance? Managers of small companies and the self-employed need to be particularly careful that accidents or losses abroad do not leave them out of pocket. Insurers say a growing number of people are taking out annual travel insurance policies, which provide cover for any number of trips in a year and eliminate the need for last-minute arrangements. Columbus, the specialist travel insurer, says sales of annual policies rose 39 per cent over the past year. For anyone who travels regularly, an annual policy is often cheaper than buying insurance for each trip separately. Most annual policies cover business trips, but do check - a few, such as NatWest's and Abbey National's, exclude them. There is usually a limit for each trip of two or three months; a few cheaper policies impose an overall annual limit for time spent outside the UK - about 150 days. Premiums for a single person vary from about Pounds 75 to about Pounds 140. Most annual policies provide at least Pounds 1m cover each for medical expenses and personal liability. Differences on other details - such as cancellation and curtailment, legal expenses, compensation for delays, and lost or delayed baggage - can be marked. Cancellation cover ranges from Pounds 1,000 with Columbus's most basic policy to Pounds 12,500 with the American Express Premier policy. Some insurers offer a choice of cover. If you never go outside Europe, why pay extra to cover potential hospital bills in the US? And if your home contents policy covers personal belongings outside the home, why pay to cover luggage a second time? Bradford &amp; Bingley building society gives a 20 per cent discount to Pounds 79.60 to anybody whose luggage is already covered. Anyone planning to ski or go scuba diving should check the small print. Most annual policies include limited skiing cover (usually 17 days a year), but some exclude it. Most annual insurance can be extended to cover your spouse and/or children for less than the price of another individual policy.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                  ANNUAL TRAVEL INSURANCE POLICIES  -------------------------------------------------------------------                           Premium*    Trip         Other Insurer                   (pounds)    limit        options  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Accident &amp; General          130       90 days      F American Express             79.50    91 days      F, L, P Barclays                     97.50    90 days      F Bradford &amp; Bingley           99.50**  90 days      F, L BUPA                        130       91 days      F, L Club Direct                 139       90 days      B, F Columbus                     79       60 days      B, F Crispin Speers              140       60 days      B, E, F, P First Direct                 75       91 days      F Frizzell                    111.78     3 months    E, F, L Home &amp; Overseas             109       30 days      F Midland                      75       91 days      F N &amp; P                        75       90 days      F, L Thomas Cook                 125       60 days      F Wexas                        98.50   10 weeks      F  ------------------------------------------------------------------- *individual, comprehensive worldwide cover for holiday and business travel.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: Catching a common code - What the Delta-Virgin link-up means for passengers 
text:  Last week's tie-up between Delta of the US and the UK's Virgin Atlantic, the latest in a series of transatlantic deals, might lead some to conclude that a revolution in business travel is in the offing. It is not, say airline industry executives privately. The business of 'code sharing', the centrepiece of these deals, is largely to do with the financial health of the airlines and does little for passengers. It may even mean some people feeling misled about which airline they are flying. Code sharing allows airlines to book passengers on each others' flights. Code-sharing partnerships include British Airways and USAir, Dutch carrier KLM and US airline Northwest, and the triple alliance of Delta, Swissair and Singapore Airlines. One of the biggest yet, between United Airlines of the US and Germany's Lufthansa, is scheduled to start this year. In practice, code sharing means a passenger in Albuquerque, New Mexico, could ask the travel agent for a flight to London's Heathrow airport and be given a Delta ticket. That ticket will have a flight number beginning 'DL' and show that the flight goes via New York's JFK. The passenger might then fly Delta to New York and from there to London on Virgin. For the airlines, the advantage is clear. They can plug into each other's networks, claiming, for example, that they fly to destinations serviced by the partner's aircraft. They are able to advertise more destinations, and marketing is cheaper because costs can be shared within what is effectively a larger network. The risk for passengers is that they might book a flight with one airline and travel on another. 'It is something akin to false pretences if this is not made clear when the ticket is bought,' says an executive with an independent airline organisation. Virgin is at pains to say that its agreement with Delta is 'transparent' - that passengers will know exactly what is happening when they inquire about their flight. It points out that there are other aspects of the deal that benefit passengers more directly. Virgin will share Delta's JFK terminal so the connection is easier. Moreover, the airlines are linking frequent-flyer programmes, so mileage points can be earned on either. Similar co-operative arrangements are in place with the likes of Northwest and KLM, and BA and USAir. But it is possible to achieve them without code-sharing deals - as Virgin has done with British Midland and BA has with Cathay Pacific.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: Bucharest bustle - Virginia Marsh offers tips on visiting the city 
text:  Bucharest's most powerful landmark is the massive white marble, gold and concrete monstrosity that the late dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, named the Palace of the People. This weekend, this monument to megalomania takes on a new role. It will house the heads of state and other dignitaries attending the Crans Montana Economic Forum - the first big international conference in Romania since Ceausescu's overthrow in 1989. The city is undergoing rapid change. Cars imported from the west choke the main boulevards, which are lined with smart new cafes, showrooms filled with foreign goods, and dozens of small boutiques and food shops. Foreign and local companies vie for the billboard space along the road from the recently modernised airport. Every morning peasants fill the city's many open air markets with their wares: round smoked cheeses encased in wax, soft white goat's cheese, cured country hams, sour cream, fresh herbs and spices. However, Bucharest remains a frustrating place to visit. The following tips should help: At the airport, the traveller must stand in two queues, one to buy a visa (Dollars 35), the other to have the freshly stamped document examined by immigration. It is probably not worth getting a visa in advance: the best tactic is to fight your way off the aircraft in order to be first in the visa queue. Book your hotel room. Bucharest's few business hotels are often full. Demand has pushed up prices to international levels despite the generally lower standards. Most of the big hotels are within easy walking distance of the main commercial district. The InterContinental, in the central university square, remains first choice. The elegant but down-at-heel Hotel Continental is popular with frequent visitors, such as World Bank or IMF officials, while the Hotel Bucuresti is useful for those with political interests - out-of-town MPs fill one-third of its rooms. Ask your hotel to send a car to collect you from the airport, for Dollars 14 to Dollars 22. Taxi drivers usually try to charge a lot more for the 15km ride. Take cash, preferably dollars; credit cards and travellers' cheques are not widely accepted. Licensed exchange houses (Casa de Schimb) often offer better rates than hotels or banks, which are crowded and open only in the morning. Avoid changing money on the street: swindlers abound. Take the right clothes: Bucharest is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. Business dress is not formal: jacket and tie for men, dress or skirt for women. Avoid running out of your favourite shampoo or toothpaste. Basic items can be hard to find. Allow enough time between appointments: punctuality is not a Romanian strong point. Meetings tend to ramble on, especially if you are using a translator, although English and French are widely spoken. The telecommunications system is terrible, so do not count on making or receiving international and domestic calls easily. If possible, make international calls early in the morning or late at night, when the lines are less busy. The system is being modernised, but this means that telephone numbers change constantly. If you have problems reaching contacts, call international directory inquiries. At this time of year, Romanians start opening their roadside Terasa (terraces), where you can recover from a day of protracted negotiations over a beer or a glass of wine or Tuica, the fiery local plum brandy. La Premiera, behind the national theatre, is one of the best. Afterwards, it's worth wandering off the main boulevards into one of the old residential areas, where you can catch a glimpse of the richness of pre-communist Bucharest. Transylvanian turrets, dripping with Belle Epoque plaster work, and wrought iron and neo-Gothic villas stand alongside eastern-looking Orthodox churches and classic 1930s apartment blocks. This architecture provides the perfect antidote to Ceausescu's palace.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Management: Outsiders welcome - US companies are developing workforce diversity 
text:  In a lecture room in the Bank of Boston, an executive is pretending to declare his homosexuality. He is taunted, laughed at and ignored for half an hour by his co-workers. When this role-playing exercise is over, he talks about how it felt to be an outsider. The employees are taking part in a diversity training course, which aims to attune them better to the feelings of others. The bank's management hopes that when they return to the office, the trainees will show more willingness to work not only with homosexual colleagues, but with any co-workers who are different from them. Through diversity training and other programmes, US corporations are attempting to grapple with the opportunities and challenges of an employee base which is increasingly heterogeneous. Throughout the 1990s, minorities, white women and immigrants will account for 85 per cent of net employment growth in the US, according to the DCI Armory, a group of specialists in diversity. To prepare for the changes, some 60 per cent of leading businesses in the US are offering or planning diversity training courses, says Myron Block, a diversity consultant for consultancy Harbridge House. The US private sector first had to deal with a more diverse workforce in the 1970s, when the federal government enforced the hire of minorities. Corporate concerns are different now from 20 years ago, however. For many companies, compliance with the law remains the main priority, but an increasing number say greater diversity makes good business sense. 'Diversity is a competitive edge issue,' says Darlene Siedshlaw, executive director of diversity for the telecommunications group US West. 'There is no question that the marketplace is more diverse than it has ever been. It adds to our bottom line to have a diverse workforce to serve that marketplace.' If a marketing force is too homogenous, for instance, it risks commiting big errors when addressing diverse audiences. 'By having Hispanics on our staff, it helps us to realise things about their culture,' says Leslie Mays, director of diversity development for footwear manufacturer Reebok. 'For instance, we have discovered that Hispanics are usually very brand loyal. The brands they use when they're growing up are what they usually use later on. So we know that when marketing to that group, we should target a young audience.' Telecommunications group AT&amp;T points to language barriers it can encounter. 'We use Spanish speakers to sell our services to the Latino market, and Mandarin speakers to sell to the Chinese-American market,' says Joeann McPhearson, district staff manager of AT&amp;T. Diversity can be important for other reasons. With the rise in popularity of ethical investments, some investors screen companies before deciding where to buy shares. 'A diverse workforce attracts more shareholders,' says McPhearson. But if diverse groups often show more creativity - at least if the problems relate to their diversity - they can also be difficult to manage. Studies show, for example, that diverse groups can take longer to accomplish tasks. 'Diversity can create more interpersonal conflict and slow things down,' says Susan Jackson, associate professor of psychology at New York University. 'Companies need to learn how to minimise these conflicts to take better advantage of diversity.' Diversity training has become an important tool for corporations facing these challenges, but the nature of the courses varies greatly. Some rely on lectures to illustrate the history of black liberation, or the nature of sexual harrassment, for instance. Black actor Bill Cosby's video on bigotry in the workplace is popular. Other formats encourage employees to open up about their personal prejudices. 'People in our training courses analyse their heritage and the messages they got when they were growing up,' says Block. Open conversation may not always be a good idea. 'It opens a can of worms on the legal front,' says Jackson. 'If an executive admits to sexual harrassment during a training course, for example, can he be fired?' Many executives question the value of diversity training on its own, not least in its effects on other employees. 'Standalone diversity training is not enough to bring change to any corporation,' says Siedshlaw. 'It can even be harmful. In the 1980s, we felt a lot of backlash from white males who felt excluded from the diversity initiatives. Now, we have a programme on the difficulties of being a white male in today's society and it's a big success.' The most successful companies in dealing with diversity, researchers say, are those that make diversity part of their corporate culture. Increasing attention is paid to companies' diversity profiles. 'We review trends in our employment profiles every month to make sure we're not losing diversity,' says Mays. To ensure that the company maintains a diverse employee base, Reebok, along with a growing number of companies, makes diversity part of the criteria managers are judged by. 'We look at the diversity of the group they manage before they came in and after they have been there for a while. And we talk to them about how they helped position different people for career advancement.' With more companies seeking minorities and women, recruitment for these groups can often be fierce. 'We've had to change the way we recruit college graduates,' says Siedshlaw. 'If you just go to the placement office, you will limit yourself, because people of colour are less inclined to use the office. You need to go to campus organisations, the Society of American Indians, for instance. We've had excellent results with the new programme. Over the last two years, 50 per cent of new hires were people of colour.' AT&amp;T even adapted its redundancy programme and abandoned seniority as a criterion for lay-offs. 'If we had just fired the people who had been at the company the least time, we would have been left with a more homogenous workforce,' McPhearson explains. To make sure recruits want to stay once they are hired, many companies have encouraged constituency groups, to act as liaisons between employees and management. Digital Equipment, for example, has a number of these groups, including the African Heritage, Asian Leadership and Gay Plus.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Small shops lead slide in optimism 
text:  The latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry shows that most retail sectors reported an increase in sales volumes in March compared with the same month in 1993. However, as has been the case in every month since July, reported sales were lower than had been expected at the start of the month. The CBI figures deduct the proportion of those who report a decline in sales from those who report an increase. The balance of retailers reporting an increase in sales in March was 12 percentage points, ahead of the 10-point gap reported in February, but well below the balance of 25 who expected an increase at the start of the month. Expectations for April have fallen. The balance of those expecting an increase in sales is now 14, the lowest figure since February 1993. Large retailers are much more upbeat about sales than small shops. The individual retail sectors which reported the strongest increases in sales in the year to March were booksellers &amp; stationers and grocers; declines were reported by chemists, furniture &amp; carpet stores and by hardware, china and DIY outlets. Although retailers report relatively modest growth, wholesalers say that sales volumes increased strongly in March.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / BSkyB fails to take up home-shopping TV option 
text:  British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television consortium, has decided not to exercise its option to keep a 50 per cent stake in QVC, the home-shopping channel which is part of the Sky multi-channel subscription package. The surprising decision has been taken even though the channel appears to be doing well and is heading for revenues of at least Pounds 40m in its first year on air. The channel was set up as a joint venture between QVC, its highly successful parent in the US, and BSkyB, the satellite group in which Pearson - owner of the Financial Times - has a significant stake. To retain its 50 per cent stake, BSkyB was required to inject substantial amounts of further cash around now but has decided not to do so. As a result, the BSkyB stake in the home-shopping venture will fall to 20 per cent on August 1. One BSkyB executive suggested that the stake may have been of more value to QVC than to the satellite company because a lot of BSkyB's energies are now being directed to the planned launch next year of pay-per-view for films and sports events. The decision not to keep up its stake in QVC has been taken despite a growing stream of profits at BSkyB. Before interest charges the satellite company is now making operational profits of Pounds 3m a week. Even after interest payments profits are running at Pounds 1.5m a week from a base of 3.3m homes subscribing to at least one BSkyB service. QVC had good pre-Christmas results but its business 'fell off a cliff' during the first three weeks of January. After that, however, sales began to grow again and executives are now confident that they have a business which in the short term will start to compete with mail-order catalogues and eventually with conventional retail outlets. Much of QVC's coverage is demonstrating individual items which can be bought by credit card, with the emphasis on 'impulse' buys. Yesterday's themes ranged from gemstones to leisurewear and gardening products.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Unions split on minimum wage plan 
text:  A public argument broke out last night between senior trade union leaders about the future of Labour's commitment to a statutory minimum wage. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, speaking on the eve of the Scottish TUC, told his delegation that Labour should commit itself to support of a statutory minimum wage of not less than Pounds 4 an hour. He said this would mean the state would 'no longer need to subsidise, through the benefit system, the bad employer who pays poverty wages'. Mr Morris went much further yesterday in his demands on Labour to introduce more radical economic policies. He said that the party should commit itself to restoring the link between the level of old-age pensions and average earnings, which was broken in 1980. He also called for a 'firm commitment to universal benefits including child benefit,' as well as a 'massive programme of affordable child care facilities' and a 'stop to de-regulation and privatisation'. Mr Morris added that these demands could be paid for if Labour backed 'a fair and progressive' tax system. 'In simple terms, the rich must pay more,' he said. But Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering union, denounced Mr Morris's proposal to fix a precise figure on a national minimum wage as 'irresponsible'. He went on: 'It is legitimate to aspire to a national minimum wage. But it is irresponsible when not in government to dictate its level.' Labour leaders, including shadow employment secretary Mr John Prescott, are also keen not to see any such commitment. Mr Jordan also criticised Mr Morris's proposals as a 'supermarket shopping-basket list' which 'would provide unlimited ammunition for Tory party political broadcasts'. He added: 'After 15 years in opposition the Labour party needs our support, not our orders, in order to win.'

text:  About half the 500,000 members of the AEEU engineering union who pay subscriptions through their pay packets under the check-off system have agreed to carry on doing so, Mr Bill Jordan, union president, said yesterday, Robert Taylor writes. He said he was confident the union would not suffer a net loss of members as a result of new rules on check-off which require written authorisation for subscriptions to be deducted by employers at source. As much as 75 per cent of the AEEU's income comes via the check-off system, which covers 65 per cent of its membership. Mr Jordan said the government's clampdown on check-off had strengthened his union by galvanising the activists to recruit members. The union also achieved a profit of more than Pounds 1.5m in 1993 - thanks to a rise in subscriptions, a shake-up of its organisation and a slowdown in membership loss.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Funding cuts anger gas watchdog 
text:  The Gas Consumers' Council argued strongly yesterday for the retention of an independent voice for customers after recent calls for a wholesale shake-up of utility regulation. The council is critical of the government's decision to cut its funding, saying the need for a consumer's voice is at its greatest during the transition from a monopoly to a competitive market. In its annual report, published today, the council says that complaints it received about British Gas dropped last year by 19 per cent to 20,428, but protests about independent suppliers rose by 43 per cent to 745. Rivals to British Gas can supply only a very small number of domestic users. But when the rest of the market is opened up for competition in April 1996, they will be able to compete for most household business. The government's detailed proposals for liberalising the household gas market have so far been delayed by six weeks. This is causing concern among independent suppliers and consumer groups. Mr Ian Powe, director of the council, said: 'Anxiety is growing about the effect this will have on compressing the consultation period for everyone to have their say.' He added that consumers should have more than a month to make their views known on the new market. The council has backed Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, in her concern that consumers will pay higher gas prices for funding energy efficiency projects.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Rail boss who may bury the hatchet: Bob Horton says he is still a hard man. But, as he tells Charles Batchelor, he is not a Beeching 
text:  Observers may be wondering if Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, has gone native. His appointment to the state-owned company set up to manage British Rail's track, signalling and stations after privatisation was confirmation to many that privatisation meant dismemberment and decline. But Mr Horton, who left British Petroleum two years ago with the reputation of being 'Horton the Hatchet', enthuses: 'We have this absolutely priceless national asset which we have jolly well got to make good use of. What we are witnessing is not a little short of miraculous. An industry which is 150 years old is being made fit for the 21st century.' Mr Horton is in charge of only one part of a railway which will soon comprise 60 independent companies. But as the monopoly supplier of track and signalling, Railtrack has an important part to play. The approach adopted by Mr Horton and Mr John Edmonds, chief executive of Railtrack and a lifelong railwayman, will play an important part in determining rail's future. Mr Horton is adamant that he has not changed, but he does not see his role as that of Dr Beeching, who slashed rail services in the 1960s. Mr Horton said: 'It would be difficult to imagine why I would want to take on this job unless I was 'native' already. Twelve months ago people said I was mad, but I felt this was a job which really had to be done. But I made no secret about my management style, and there may be a few bruised feelings around the place.' He is keen to be tough on inefficiency and waste within the organisation so as to be kind to customers and the level of train services. 'In three years' time we will have a railway operating more reliably, more efficiently and providing more capacity.' One of the first tasks of Railtrack was to calculate the true cost of running a railway service. Under BR, the train operating companies had not been charged the full cost of replacing track and signalling. Railtrack's calculations led to a doubling of charges and to howls of protest from BR managers, many of whom hope to stage buy-outs over the next two to three years. Mr Horton said he was prepared to fine-tune his charges, but argued that the principle of identifying the true cost of all activities is a sound one. 'For the first time we have transparency rather than the fudge and cross-subsidy which used to take place.' Replacing BR's internal procedures with contracts negotiated between independent companies should also improve efficiency. He said BR's internal arrangements had the virtue of simplicity, but sometimes led to cosy relationships which were not necessarily the most efficient. 'It is mind-boggling that nearly Pounds 2bn of annual procurement could have existed without contractual relations being established.' The main attack on costs will be on the annual maintenance bill for the 10,000 miles of track, 90,000 bridges and 2,500 stations for which Railtrack is responsible. But Mr Horton believes Railtrack can also make savings by managing its own affairs better. It has recruited specialists from outside the industry to improve its record of project management. It has Pounds 500m to spend on 5,000 improvement schemes this year. But making an impact on a network which has suffered from decades of neglect will take time. A backlog of track maintenance means speed restrictions are common while many stations are in need of urgent repair. Mr Horton said that going live on April 1 meant Railtrack could start to address these problems instead of sitting through endless meetings with civil servants. 'But the problems ahead are at least as great as those we have overcome. It will be a long and stony road.'

The group's survey calculates the income needed to maintain the standard of living of eight families. It finds that the overall cost of goods and services rose 3.7 per cent in the year to February, but private housing costs fell 2 per cent thanks to lower mortgage rates and lower local taxes. The most expensive place is London, followed by Woking, Surrey; Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire; Slough, Berkshire; and Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. The cheapest place is Northern Ireland, followed by Thurso, Highland; and Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan. If housing is ignored, the most expensive places are Lerwick, Shetland; Chingford, Essex; Manchester; Ealing, west London; and Maidstone, Kent. The cheapest are Billingham, Cleveland; and Wolverhampton, West Midlands. The survey found that over the past five years, costs have risen in the north compared to the national average, while lower house prices have reduced the relative cost of living in the south.

headline:  FT  18 APR 94 / Raw material prices alarm manufacturers 
text:  Prices of raw materials have supplanted the level of interest rates as the main concern of west Midlands manufacturers, says the latest survey of corporate opinion and performance from the area's Chambers of Commerce. Isolated increases in metals prices have deepened concern about raw material prices in general. Manufacturers and stockholders have reported price rises for aluminium, stainless steel and steel made from scrap metal in a region where economic health is closely linked to the state of the engineering sector and where there has been traditional reliance on the vehicle and aerospace industries. The extent to which metal price rises, a source of sensitivity in the engineering industry, are influencing national statistics and acting as a guide to future inflation will be apparent today with the publication of the producer prices index. After a 30 per cent fall during the recession, prices for aluminium sheet, bar and plate started to rise at the end of January. Over the past 10 weeks the lead time for delivery from mills has increased from 2 1/2 months to six months, said Mr Clive Orford, deputy managing director of Apollo Metals, the Birmingham-based stockholder and processor. He warned that 'if manufacturers are looking for material cost cuts, they will be sorely disappointed'. Demand was rising and aluminium producers hoped for higher margins after years of depressed returns. Glynwed International, the diversified engineering group which is an extensive user of steel, said that stainless steel prices had risen because of the nickel surcharge imposed by producers. The level of this surcharge depends on the movement of London Metal Exchange nickel prices. There is also a scrap surcharge imposed on steel made in electric furnaces and frequently used in the engineering industry. But, stressed Mr Nick Boucher, Glynwed's group planning manager, 'there is no tightness in the market; there is plenty of metal around'. Pressure on steel prices remains downwards rather than upwards. British Steel prices remain below 1990 levels despite attempts to impose rises on the market. 'There are threats of price rises all the time, but I've not seem them,' said Mr Robert Woolley, managing director of Frederick Woolley, the Birmingham components manufacturer. Generally the European steel market is oversupplied and steelmakers face capacity cuts. But Mr Geoff Field, director of the National Association of Steel Stockholders, whose members handle more than 60 per cent of the steel bought by UK manufacturers, warned that there is a limit on how far steel consumers can push prices down. 'It's a good situation for manufacturers, but there is a limit under which the steel producers and stockholders cannot go,' Mr Field said. The preoccupation of Midlands manufacturers with material prices does not surprise Mr Woolley. He pointed out that materials account for between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of manufacturers' costs, and said: 'Get a saving there and you'll be moving in the right direction.' Mr Tony Bradley, the economist at the Chambers of Commerce, says diminishing concern with interest and inflation rates has allowed manufacturers' attention to switch to other cost pressures.

text:  Sir, David Gardner may be right in his assessment of Theodoros Pangalos and the Pasok government in Greece (The FT Interview, December 22). But when he crosses the border into Turkey, he makes assumptions which are either untrue or out of date. The latter is certainly the case where he talks of Turkey aspiring to membership of the European Union. Turkey is now ambivalent in its attitude to the Union, not only because of its growing role in central Asia but also because the EU is in many ways doing more for Turkey by way of apology for keeping Turkey out than it would if it allowed Turkey in. As for 'historic Greek-Turkish enmity', there is no such thing - in Turkey. Many a traveller has commented on the absence of any anti-Greek sentiment in Turkey, and contrasted it with the outpourings of anti-Turkish bile in Greece.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Tide of gloom starts to ebb: There is reason to believe that European economies are bouncing back 
text:  It is easy to be glum about Europe. Overall output in the continent's 19 advanced industrialised countries is thought to have fallen this year for the first time since 1975. Western Europe's jobless total is rising inexorably. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris forecasts that 22m, or 11.5 per cent, of the region's labour force will be out of work in 1995. Unemployment, now about 10.7 per cent, has more than doubled in the 18 years since the first serious recession of the postwar years. Business and consumer confidence is weak. For most, the long upsurge of prosperity of the 1980s is a distant memory. So is the age of political miracles that brought the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism just four years ago. With few exceptions, Europe's political leaders appear exhausted. Their governments are deeply unpopular and, saddled with rising budget deficits, incapable of pump-priming economic recovery. Yet 1993 may turn out to be the year in which Europe's fortunes turned. Although it will be remembered for recession, currency crises and lengthening dole queues, 1993 is ending more positively for the members of the European Union and their immediate neighbours. The economic fundamentals have improved. More important, the sense of drift has stopped. Businesses, governments and the European Commission have woken up to the remorseless increase in competition worldwide. Britain's two tough budgets this year, the 'Standort Deutschland' debate in Germany and the Bonn government's subsequent conversion to the doctrine of more work and less leisure, plus the Commission's white paper on Growth Competitiveness and Employment, are symptoms of a change of mood. More telling is what is happening in businesses in the UK and on the continent. Companies are becoming leaner and meaner. The spectre of competition from the newly industrialising countries of east Asia has made the US practice of 'downsizing', with heavy job losses, respectable in Europe. Trade unions are for the most part quiescent and in some cases willing to aid management rationalise operations. This month's boardroom clear-out at Metallgesellschaft, the German industrial conglomerate, after the discovery of large losses, was novel in its ruthlessness. Even the long-running and baffling business soap opera centring on allegations of theft and industrial espionage against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the Volkswagen group production director, began with a serious purpose when VW sought out the former General Motors director to push through a cost-cutting revolution within the group. Such trends are sure to intensify once this month's Uruguay Round accord to liberalise world trade comes into force. The agreement, even before ratification, could act as a spur to companies to invest and rationalise. Over time, the Gatt accord should promote growth, with Europe standing to gain more than most other regions of the world from freer trade. Computer simulations from the OECD suggest that the Uruguay Round will add at least Dollars 270bn in 1991 prices to world income in 2002. The European Union's share is estimated at Dollars 71bn, equivalent to 1.7 per cent of the region's gross domestic product, while that of the European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries is put at Dollars 38bn or 6 per cent of regional GDP. The real benefits should be greater. Such computer calculations take no account of the increased business confidence that should flow from freer trade or the fact that this month's accord has been felicitously timed after so many years of delay and frustration. Several European economies have performed unexpectedly well in recent months. Britain's recovery is firmly established. German gross domestic product grew in the third as well as the second quarter. France appears to have touched bottom. Trends in smaller economies such as Austria, Switzerland, Ireland and Denmark have been encouraging. The charts, showing relative unit labour costs in manufacturing, illustrate how several big European economies (Germany is an exception) are more competitive internationally than they were a year ago, while Japan has suffered a substantial set back. Short and long-term interest rates have fallen over the past year as the Bundesbank has cautiously eased its monetary policy. The German 'repo rate' is at 6 per cent compared with 9.75 per cent in September 1992, just before the first European monetary crisis, which resulted in the exit of sterling and the lira from the exchange rate mechanism. Since then, UK and Italian short-term rates have roughly halved. France's short-term borrowing costs have fallen close to German levels from about 14 per cent in the 1992 currency crisis and 9 per cent in late July this year before speculative flows forced the August decision to widen the system's fluctuation margins to 15 per cent. Inflation in Europe is low, with the OECD projecting a deceleration for its European members, excluding Turkey, to an average annual rate of 2.3 per cent by the end of 1995 from about 3.1 per cent at present. Oil prices have fallen in real terms to levels last seen before the first oil shock of 1973. Large gaps between potential and actual output in countries such as Italy, France and the UK suggest that home-made inflationary pressures will remain subdued. To be sure, there are risks. Given the political instability of the Middle East, only the brave would bank on oil prices remaining at their present low levels of less than Dollars 15 a barrel. In spite of the past year's falls in nominal interest rates, real rates are relatively high. Some of the optimism that propelled European equity markets to new peaks this month could evaporate if German inflation proves more stubborn than expected and the Bundesbank slows its cautious rate-cutting policy. In some countries, tighter fiscal policies to combat swollen budget deficits could weaken recovery. German GDP is widely expected to fall again in the first half of 1994 as benefit cuts, higher petrol taxes, a wage freeze for civil servants and increased pension contributions take DM60bn from consumers. In Britain, voters have reacted less positively than financial markets to Mr Kenneth Clarke's November Budget, which, with that of Mr Norman Lamont in March, will cost taxpayers a cumulative Pounds 15bn to Pounds 17bn in three years. The fiscal legacy of the recession years in most countries, heavy household debts in the UK and Scandinavia, the continuing need for businesses to restructure to stay competitive, and consequent high unemployment will make for a joyless recovery. There will not be much of a 'feel good' factor in Europe in the years ahead. Europe will seem to many of its citizens to be in recession long after growth has returned, posing a real threat to incumbent governments. Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden go to the polls next year and political upheavals cannot be ruled out. But looking beyond 1994, there is a good prospect of steady, if unspectacular, growth over a prolonged period with low inflation. Western Europe may even be moving into what future generations will call a 'golden age'. But it could take many years before it feels that way to its inhabitants.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Cold comfort park: Euro Disney is hoping for a happier new year 
text:  Most visitors to EuroDisneyland over the holiday period are there to see Mickey and Minnie Mouse capering around the gigantic Christmas tree. Not Alice Ross. Mrs Ross is a woman with a mission. She is an accountant from Delaware, in the US, and an investor in Walt Disney, the US entertainment group. Disney has seen its shares fall sharply this year, owing to the losses it has incurred on its 49 per cent stake in Euro Disney, the struggling leisure company that operates the EuroDisneyland theme park. Mrs Ross was spending two days at EuroDisneyland to see what the problem might be. 'My Disney stock has been sinking like a stone because of this place and, as I'm over in France, I thought: 'Why not rub a little salt in the wound?' ' she said. 'I'm looking into everything. Disney holds its annual shareholders' meeting in Delaware. I'm going to tell Mike Eisner (the Disney chairman) what I think.' A belligerent shareholder such as Mrs Ross is only one of the problems plaguing Mr Eisner and his colleagues. They will spend the festive season putting the finishing touches to the proposals they will present next month to Euro Disney's creditor banks. They hope to persuade the banks to save the company from collapse by agreeing to restructure its FFr20.3bn (Pounds 2.3bn) net debt. The US group has warned the banks that, unless the restructuring is completed by March 31, Euro Disney, which reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn for the year to September 30, will be forced to close. In the meantime, Euro Disney is hoping for a repetition of last Christmas, when EuroDisneyland was buoyed by a surge of visitors. More than 30,000 people visited the theme park on New Year's eve: well below the record of 90,000 in September last year, but much better than its low of 5,000 one icy day last January. A successful Christmas and new year would not only help to ease the strain on Euro Disney's cashflow, but would also act as a timely demonstration to the banks that it might be worth saving. EuroDisneyland's employees have done their best to deck it out in festive finery. Ivy bells dangle from the lamp posts. Mickey and Minnie Mouse skate across the Hotel New York ice rink. The strains of Christmas muzak are piped all over the park. Even the barber shop quartet in the Main Street shopping arcade has ditched its usual repertoire in favour of carols. At 5pm each day one child is chosen to light the 20-metre Christmas tree. The decorations alone had been enough to tempt Corinne Jillit, a public relations executive from Angouleme in western France, to bring her four-year-old son. 'The park looks so pretty at this time of year,' she said. 'We'd rather come in the winter, when we don't have to queue to get on the rides.' Werner Muller, an engineer from Hamburg visiting with his six-year-old twins, agreed. 'Friends who came here in August had to queue for two hours just to get on the rides,' he said. 'At this time of year the kids don't have to wait too long, just as well given the weather.' The cold was already proving too much for other visitors. 'It's freezing,' said Willi Ramstein, an Italian architect, who had come to the park during a business trip to Paris. 'The park's great, but the weather's terrible.' Jane Pritchard from south Wales said: 'You'd think they'd sell warm hats in this weather.' Her companion added: 'Never mind, we'll go to the Florida park next time.' 'It's sunny there.' The souvenir shops were packed with festive memorabilia - a Winnie the Pooh Christmas stocking for FFr125, a Mickey Mouse Santa hat for FFr30 and a Goofy bauble for FFr29 - but no woolly hats. As for Mrs Ross, her mission had only just started. But on her first impressions, she seemed to agree with the other shivering visitors. 'They should have built this place somewhere warmer.'

We do not think pickpocketing is such a problem in Tokyo. In EuroDisneyland, we were in a 90-minute queue for Pirates of the Caribbean and our mother thought she felt somebody touching her pockets. She turned round and the lady behind said: 'It's just me.' But mum was sure she was a pickpocket. The staff said that it just happens and that they were not going to do anything about it. In Tokyo, the staff smiled and gave us toys and sweets. The staff did not smile very much at EuroDisneyland. We think Tokyo Disneyland is cleaner.

text:  Jazz fans have reason to be nostalgic and partisan: there really have been golden eras when new and groundbreaking talent queued for a hearing. In the 1930s, swing was the thing; in the 1940s, bebop burst on to the scene; in the 1950s the cool school opened, and in the 1960s and 1970s, free music and then fusion marked the extremes of commerciality. If the 1980s are remembered as the time bebop boomed again, alongside acid dance, what will the 1990s come to represent? A consolidation of world beat in jazz, the post-modernisation of bebop in the new chamber jazz or the return to basic principles? Well, 1993 seemed to encapsulate the lot. From the sepia-tinged New Orleans beginnings to the synthesized way ahead, the history of jazz was personified last year in the swinging Lionel Hampton Orchestra, the retro-classical trumpet tones of Wynton Marsalis, the new world of improvisation in South African Bheki Mseleku and the young urban angst of New Yorker Steve Coleman. The annual migration to Europe of sax statesmen such as Sonny Rollins, Johnny Griffin and Jackie McLean kept the movement in context while the Five Blind Boys of Alabama, as well as Harry Connick Jr, reminded us that 'jazz' can still deliver more fundamental pleasure. Who will light the way in 1994? For this critic at least, a glow of pleasure lingers from saxophonist David Murray's summer visit. The tidal energy and burning ideas which powered the trio through his own neo-bop compositions surpassed almost anything else on offer and his return is eagerly awaited. Besides Murray, two other saxophonists who continue to illuminate new fields of improvisation are Joe Henderson and Norwegian Jan Garbarek. Though one blows warm and the other cold, they share the authority and inner peace which gives their different sounds an embracing sense of purpose. For sheer excitement and exoticism, pianists like Don Pullen and Randy Weston set the standard for 1994. Weston, the beatnik's role model, continues to fleck his rich weave of Afro-jazz with Middle Eastern colour, to intoxicating effect, as seen at the Royal Festival Hall. Even Ahmad Jamal, who once provided the airy framework for Miles Davis' early recordings, is finding a more dense style and the vaulted arches of the Union Chapel last spring teemed with the splintering chords and interlinking quotes borne by the surging Jamal pulse. In contrast to the channelled exuberance of contemporary piano-led groups, the Paul Motian school of jazz has cultivated a kind of speccy and earnest introspection. This has been most noticeable in guitar players, exemplified by John Scofield. Last year the young fogeys of jazz were gently teased by guitarist Bill Frisell's cranky dissection of American composers from Ives to Madonna at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Back at the Union Chapel, as part of the new expanded London Jazz Festival, the jazz intelligentsia were exercised by the intricate workings of master guitarist Jim Hall, one of the most original yet underrated jazz musicians around today. Thoughtful and reflective music like Henderson's and Hall's will characterise the 1990s - unless their minor scales are sidelined by the pianists.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Arts: Happily, some triumphs stick in the memory - Television in 1993 
text:  Given that 1993 was the year when ITV went down the drain, liked what it found, and stayed there; and when the BBC was preoccupied with administrative tribulations - the agonies arising from 'Producer Choice', anxiety over the government's attitude towards the licence fee, the position of the Director-General who was found to be neither on the BBC staff nor paying tax in quite the expected manner - it is astounding how many good programmes there were. Of course boo-boos, stumers and downright dogs appeared in the usual quantities. ITV piloted an Anglicised version of that inimitable American comedy The Golden Girls and, even though we told them that shifting the action to Sussex and trying to get people such as Wendy Craig to deliver New York wisecracks in Surbiton accents was a disaster, they persisted and made a series called Brighton Belles. Then, when it bombed, they had to pull it out of the schedules. BBC2 mounted a live 'animal watch' series called Nightshift in which the degree of wild eyed enthusiasm from the presenters was in inverse proportion to the amount of activity among the animals. When the pitch of the voices approached that of hysteria it meant the foxes and badgers had gone to sleep, and you could safely switch off before the scene cut to some murky garden where nothing was happening. There was approximately the same amount of interest in what Channel 4 decided would be the next big spectator sport after darts (whatever happened to televised darts?) and sumo wrestling (whatever . . . ). In the event, World Chess: Short v. Kasparov proved marginally less interesting than watching blancmange set. Happily, however, it is mainly the pleasures and triumphs which stick in the memory, and although recent programmes come most readily to mind  - in drama, for instance, To Play The King and The Buddha Of Suburbia from the BBC and Cracker from ITV - you find when you go back through the lists that there have been treasures throughout the year. Staying with drama, Channel 4's Lipstick On Your Collar was not Dennis Potter's best series, yet there were several set piece musical numbers including 'Unchained Melody' and 'Blue Suede Shoes' which I would happily watch over and over again. The performance of Honeysuckle Weeks as 12-year-old Kitty in BBC2's Goggle Eyes, adapted by Deborah Moggach from Anne Fine's book, should win an award from somebody: she made the emotions of a child whose mother finds herself a new man vivid and touchingly funny. In Lady Chatterley on BBC1 one of the Redgrave clan, Joely Richardson, set a trend in getting her kit off which was followed later in the year by cousin Jemma Redgrave in The Buddha Of Suburbia. However, it was not so much the female nudity in Lady Chatterley which caused the fuss. So many female viewers offered up hymns to Sean Bean's bottom, that they were rewarded in the autumn with a reprise when Bean stripped off again for A Woman's Guide To Adultery on ITV which wins the Dunkley Naff Drama Of The Year Award. In 1993 political correctness was more evident than ever on British television, so it was a good job it was women ogling a male posterior and not the other way about. Unfortunately Ken Russell never found quite the right approach or tone for putting Lady C on television, so apart from the usual British fuss over the human body it turned out to be a non-event. Once again there were very few original single television dramas, though late in the year BBC2 screened a 'Performance' series offering several impressive examples of theatre plays, including Fiona Shaw's Hedda Gabler. Among the few single dramas that did turn up, Roddy Doyle's adaptation of his own book, The Snapper, on BBC2 proved outstanding. Directed in Dublin by Stephen Frears it brought to the television depiction of Irish life a degree of humanity which is almost invariably missing from the Irish material we normally see on television. Honours for the best British serial drama of the year must be fought out between Granada's Cracker, with Robbie Coltrane playing the drinking, flirting, gambling police psychologist; and BBC1's Between The Lines, also a police series, which so obviously stood out even though it did not manage to sustain the pace, tension, and overall brilliance of the opening series. It did still manage to combine splendid exterior entertainment with interior political and social sinews in a manner that is not often achieved on television, and very rarely beyond a single series. The drama of the year, however, was not British but German. Having given us Heimat in 1986, a great pantechnicon of a series about several generations of life in rural Germany which you might have thought was a once in a lifetime effort, Edgar Reitz excelled himself this year with The Second Heimat: A New Generation. Presumably the longest finite drama series ever made for television - excluding soap operas, in other words - this extended to 13 two-hour episodes and told the story of modern Germany from the early 1960s. It was intelligent, consistently well acted, charming, provocative, informative, occasionally infuriating in its dedication to modern music, and, once you were properly involved, utterly engrossing. In north west London viewers sought out cassettes of missed episodes with the passion of philatelists completing sets of stamps. In another weak year for comedy the top series was, once again, Have I Got News For You on BBC2. Most memorable of all their episodes was that in which Roy Hattersley's place was taken by a tub of lard, a programme that proved, thanks largely though not wholly to Paul Merton, to be much funnier than the later programme when Hattersley finally turned up in person. At the year's end only two brand new comedy series seem worth recalling: Chef on BBC1 with Lenny Henry playing, and occasionally over playing, a prima donna cook; and Goodnight Sweetheart, also on BBC1, starring Nicholas Lyndhurst as a television repairman who finds a time warp in a London alleyway (it does not affect anyone else) and regularly travels back to a pub in the era of the London Blitz. Absolutely Fabulous would walk off with the laurels but for the fact that 1993 brought us only a repeat screening of last year's series. The second series will be with us in spring 1994, thank goodness. The failure of the new ITV companies to produce even a single nominee for 'Best Situation Comedy' was rightly emphasised by presenter Jonathan Ross in this month's British Comedy Awards. Once more the arts-and-culture series of the year was Without Walls on Channel 4 which has now succeeded in making all its competitors look old-fashioned if not downright tatty. From Rory Bremner on Dame Edna to a series on the effect of drugs upon the arts ('The Art Of Tripping'), from 'Diana Sex Goddess' to the sociology of the Rolls Royce, the series has led the way and set the pace. BBC1's Omnibus gave us a marvellously mischievous programme from Kriss Rusmanis on the truth about orchestral conductors; and the best single arts documentary of the year was Sheree Folkson's fascinatingly contrived investigation of Gericault's painting, 'The Raft Of The Medusa' in BBC2's series Every Picture Tells A Story. The documentary prize must go to Thatcher: The Downing Street Years, provided there is a separate wildlife category to allow an award for Attenborough's Life In The Freezer, a magnificent BBC1 series on Antarctica which, as Attenborough himself would be the first to concede, was made possible by a big team of astoundingly hardy and inventive film makers. The Thatcher programmes were unmissable not merely because the title role was played with such ferocious egotism, but because the series as a whole proved, perhaps for the first time, that as a tool of history television can be as useful as books. It may even be superior, once the history in question  -as in this instance - enters the period for which we possess a huge archive of television news. A special award for Striving To Tell The Truth About Aids On Television Despite The Tunnel Vision Of The Industry's Politically Correct Agenda Setters, would normally go automatically to Joan Shenton of the independent company Meditel, the only person who, from the very beginning, has insisted on keeping a level head and publicising the evidence, even when it does not put haloes on homosexuals. This year, however, it goes to Barraclough Carey, another independent production company, which produced The Plague, a four-part series for Channel 4 surveying the entire history of Aids. The last programme rather let down the rest, allowing an instinct for compassion to overcome the necessary rigour of good journalism (it was weak, for instance, on the true incidence of Aids in sub-Saharan Africa, on the precise practices of the British haemophiliac who is supposed to have given Aids to four women, and on the comparative global seriousness of the disease) yet the series was still such a powerful, admirable and extensive piece of work that it deserves the prize. Speaking of good journalism, 1993 was the year when ITV carelessly and stupidly abandoned This Week, First Tuesday and Viewpoint, three series known for the seriousness of their approach and the high quality of many of their results. Having been told repeatedly by the new men (yes, men) in ITV not to whine for a golden past but to wait and see what was put in its place, we have now begun to see - and very depressing it is. There is one spark of hope. The Discovery Channel has announced that, having shown a First Tuesday programme this month, it has now commissioned Yorkshire TV to continue the series throughout 1994. I must admit that when ITV began its systematic abandonment of grown up television it never occurred to me that the satellite channels might step into the breach. Let us hope it is the beginning of a major trend: it is high time satellite television ended its reliance on American, Australian and British repeats and began to put money into the origination of proper programmes. No doubt that will take some time. Meanwhile it seems pretty clear that 1994 is going to be the BBC's year.

text:  The thought of professional directors and choreographers going into Wandsworth prison and drilling the inmates for a production of a big theatrical musical would be peculiarly satisfying, whatever the title involved. When it happens to be Guys And Dolls with its cast of card sharps and con men the idea becomes irresistible. Guys, Dolls And D-Wing (BBC2, 8.00) is a documentary which records the process. Given the speed with which stills photographers from the advertising industry switch these days into directing Hollywood movies, it was a bright thought to have David Bailey try his hand at directing a studio drama. The result is Who Dealt? (C4, 9.30) a half-hour story about a woman, in a game of bridge with her husband's friends, who begins to talk too much. Hard to establish exactly how much has been edited out of Beeban Kidron's account of prostitution in New York, but Hookers, Hustlers, Pimps And Their Johns (C4, 11.10) is reckoned to be the most explicit programme of its sort ever shown on British television.

text:  Some people may like Peter Pan at Sadler's Wells, though it should come with a warning. This is not Peter Pan with dialogue, wit, symbolism and a story that many of us admire. Nor is this the old Sadler's Wells that many of us remember with affection. Scarcely a monument to a better yesterday remains, save that the place is still in Rosebery Avenue. This is regimented, educational theatre backed by the London Arts Board with the help of Czechoslovakia. Not the new republics of the 1990s, but the Czechoslovakia before the Berlin Wall came down and when it made sense to do things in mime because there was no guaranteed freedom of expression. The Black Light Theatre of Prague's production is interesting, if you have not seen the techniques before, for a few minutes because it has some clever staging and visual effects. The coffee cups float up and down, brightness falls from the air, the lighting is ultra-violet. It does not take long for such effects to wear thin. If you can float one object, you can float another, and another, and make a crocodile crawl across the floor in lights. Twice is enough. The Prague production makes the nearly always fatal mistake of seeking to combine too many art forms in one: dance, music, visual show-off while trying to tell a story. The dance is sometimes pretty. The music is varied, but always banal - never fast enough to have zip, never slow enough to have feeling: real old communist central Europe. The story is lost. The real Peter Pan has some very good lines and intriguing psychology. It ends with Mr Darling retreating into the kennel to which he had banished the dog on the night the Darlings went out to dinner. In the Black Light version this is omitted. If you go to see, be sure to buy a copy of the programme, read it and keep it. In terms of pretentiousness, it is a collector's item. Sadler's Wells Theatre until January 8. (071) 434 0909

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Management: Learning to read between the lines - A CV can be economical with the truth 
text:  Years ago, CVs were dry, formal documents. Without much attention to either presentation style or self-aggrandisement, people simply reported rather mundanely and factually their biographical details. This quaint, unselfconscious approach has, in the same way as British party political broadcasts, been taken over by the ad men, the publicity gurus and the public relations people. Politicians have learned the meaning and virtue of the soundbite and the impression of the Italian suit versus the donkey jacket. The US influence of 'talking up' nearly all personal achievements means selectors must be pretty subtle when reading between the lines. Likewise, the general public are now offered the benefits of CV consultants to improve the way they come across. No life is too ordinary, no work history too boring, no pastimes too menial to be considered unworthy of the image treatment. CV consultants are strangers whose job is to take the details of a rich, varied and complicated life and precis it into a carefully thought-out and laid-out page of A4. There are those who believe this is really money for old rope and they can happily, confidently and money-savingly do it themselves. After all, they argue, they know the life history facts and the purpose of the CV best of all. Psychologists call the task of CV consultants 'impression management'. It means quite simply 'attempts to change, alter and shape the impression that others receive'. Through variations in dress, vocabulary and possessions, we all try to create a favourable impression of ourselves to selected others. If we put in so much effort at the job interview, it makes sense to spend as much, if not more, time and money on the CV. As a consequence of the professional treatment, the most dreary and ordinary individual with a frankly mediocre, even failed work history can look like a success. No one, it seems, can fail to benefit from the skill of the impression management professional. Read a peer's CV and the way he or she describes a modest achievement or mundane duty, and one can see the benefits of being economical with the truth. While this may be good for the job hunter, CV-manship certainly presents a problem for the selection and recruitment specialist. If all students are Einstein-like geniuses, all workers are productive Stakhanovites, and all entrepreneurs are neo-Bransons, how can one distinguish between them? There are three important clues in the modern CV. First what is left out. Beware the CV which ignores or fudges chronological order: people may prefer to ignore long periods on the dole, a failed early career, an unwelcome start at one level. All sorts of important information may be omitted in the interests of the applicant. Selectors should perhaps have a checklist of information they really need and obtain it from the applicant if the CV does not provide it. Second, there are the grand generalisations. 'My department had a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) budget' does not mean the applicant was in charge of it. 'Co-ordinated and facilitated staffing issues' could mean anything. Third, can the information be verified? The more difficult it appears to check, the more likely that it is a fudge. Beware the colonial experience where applicants held impressive-sounding jobs, even if they were genuine, in some far-flung outpost where their skin colour and ability to speak English ensured them senior positions. Names and addresses of organisations on the CV help a great deal. The paradox of CV-manship is that there may well be an inverse relationship between the CV and person behind it. Over-egging the pudding - glossy brochures with career histories spanning several pages - suggests the cumulative attempts of desperate outplacement consultants. The greater the flourish, the more the prizes, the quicker the promotion - the more ordinary the individual. The author offers a modest CV and is based at University College London.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Management: The intellectual organisation - What will companies be like in the next century? In the first of a three-part series this week, Charles Handy argues that the main challenge for employers will be keeping and motivating staff 
text:  It is ironic, but just when capitalism has so clearly triumphed over communism, we are seeing Karl Marx's great dream come true in a way which he could never have envisaged. In ten years' time, in most successful businesses, the workers will truly 'own the means of production' because those means will be in their own heads and at their fingertips. It is now widely accepted that by that date 70 per cent or more of the work that we do will require brain skills not manual skills, and when that happens, the cliche that our people are our greatest asset will acquire a hard financial reality. That is when we will take notice. Already, many a business has a market value three or four times the worth of its fixed assets. To call the gap 'goodwill' is to trivialise it. That gap is the market's estimate of the worth of the intellectual property in the business - not just its patent rights, brands and research in progress, but the skills, knowledge and experience of its people. When Microsoft briefly topped the charts earlier this year, the New York Times commented that all there was to put your money on was 'the imagination of the workers'. No one can truly own that imagination except the workers themselves, and they can walk out of the door at any time. The emerging importance of intellectual property, broadly defined, is going to change many things beyond recognition. When every business that pursues higher added value thinks in the ways that financial service organisations, advertising agencies and consultancies already do, and seeks to turn its intellect into profit, what was of marginal importance will become commonplace. Shareholders, for instance, can no longer be owners, in any real sense, of other people's brains, but only investors or, more accurately, backers. The short term will then, I imagine, feature even more, for who would take a long-term bet on an organisation built on the imagination of its workers? The short term will also dominate the minds of individuals. Once they realise that they are the key assets of a business, they will be more determined than ever to build those personal assets and to take them wherever they will be most productive. Loyalty will be first to one's own career, then to one's profession and only thirdly to the employer. More and more people will pursue 'actors' careers', seeing life as a sequence of roles in projects, sometimes within one large organisation or hopping among several, or behaving as independents with a 'portfolio' of roles. Some will do this out of choice, seeing themselves as potential stars in their bit of the world; others will do it of necessity, as organisations pick and choose talents for projects and discard the ones they don't need. Large parts of organisations could ultimately become a collection of project teams, harnessing the intellectual assets around a task or an assignment, rather as a consultancy company or an advertising agency does now. To the individual, the organisation will offer, not the promise of a planned career, but a series of opportunities which one's skill profile may or may not fit. All the world will then, in a sense, be a stage: a sequence of teams with a changing cast of performers, backed by a small continuing production team. That will not be an easy or a comfortable world, or even a very desirable one, but the tide of technology and competition cannot be halted, oven if you don't like the stuff it brings in with it. We must ride the tide, not fight it. The challenge for business will be to find ways to bind to themselves the players on whom they can depend for the future. Good conditions of work and employment will not be enough, for there will often be comparable ones around the corner. To be a 'preferred employer' it will be necessary to make the vital staff into quasi-partners, with more share ownership and bonus schemes, so that they share the future of the organisation, good and bad, and to invest at the same time in the constant regeneration of their intellectual assets, despite the possibility that the regenerated assets will leave. It would not be unreasonable, for instance, to expect to invest the traditional 10 per cent depreciation (or regeneration) allowance of both time and salary in the education and development of each individual. Keeping staff is one thing, working them efficiently is another. Project leadership will become the key to corporate performance. To build a cohesive team out of the requisite mix of different roles and talents is never easy, as any theatre director will confirm. Hierarchy cuts little ice with stars, for as their leader you have only as much power and influence as they allow you. Leadership in the world of people assets draws its power from the people over whom it is exercised. It is a world where loyalty has to be earned from the individual, not demanded. Do all this, and there is more. A collection of project teams, no matter how well led and how well starred, is not in itself an organisation. These teams have to be welded together to give them the clout they need in the market. The 'intellectual organisation' needs to be both small and big, local and global, tight and loose. It needs, in short, to be federal. Federalism is too little understood this side of the Channel and the Atlantic. It is always unfashionable in monarchical or oligarchical regimes because it is built on shared power, compromise and negotiation. Unfamiliar, unpopular and hard to make work, it is nevertheless the way all organisations are heading, because centrally-directed systems are too expensive, too often wrong, too restrictive and too imprisoning for the human soul. When that human soul is your key asset, you have to give it heed. To do that, and remain efficient, is the leading challenge facing our organisations. The author has written many books on organisations and their futures. His new book, The Empty Raincoat, will be published by Hutchinson in February. Tomorrow: John Neill of Unipart.

text:  At the beginning of this year the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) challenged a number of British companies to take a fresh look at the role of business, its underlying purpose, how it operates, how its performance is measured and its role in society. The original inspiration, according to the RSA, was a lecture by Charles Handy (see article above) entitled 'What is a company for?' The result was the establishment of the RSA's three-year inquiry - Tomorrow's Company: the role of business in a changing world - backed by 25 participating companies ranging from Cable and Wireless, Cadbury and Unipart to IBM, Manpower and National Westminster Bank. Their collective aim is to look at the issues from the perspective of different stakeholders - customers, suppliers, providers of capital, employees and community - and to try to develop a shared vision of the future. At the same time a network of more than 400 interested individuals - drawn mainly from large and small businesses - was formed to assist the participating senior executives in their task. The RSA hopes to widen the debate in mid-February when the inquiry team publishes its interim findings. The first major platform for discussing them will be at the Tomorrow's Company National Conference on March 17 at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. This occasion will be an opportunity for the team to test its ideas in preparation for the final report, due to be published in 1995. For further information on the RSA Inquiry call Anna Gorely on 071-930-5115 and for information on the conference call Gay Webb on 0532-832600.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / House sales 'to rise 15%': Homes more affordable than for many years, says Halifax 
text:  The housing market recovery will gather pace next year, Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, says today. It expects house sales to increase by 15 per cent in 1994 while prices could rise on average by about 5 per cent. Halifax says in its new year forecasts that it does not expect measures announced in last month's Budget, including further phased reductions in mortgage tax relief, to inhibit the recovery. 'Houses are as affordable now as they have been at any time in the past decade, and are probably as affordable as they have been since the 1960s in many parts of the country,' it says. It adds that the average mortgage repayment as a percentage of male average earnings has fallen to 22 per cent compared with a peak of almost 50 per cent in 1989-90. In spite of this the number of house sales in England and Wales was thought to have risen by about only 5 per cent this year while average UK house prices increased by about only 2 per cent. Halifax expects the pace of recovery to accelerate next year as the general economic recovery becomes more pronounced and fears of unemployment diminish. 'We expect activity levels to rise by around 15 per cent in 1994, probably in excess of 1.3m house moves in England and Wales,' it said. That would compare with a low of 1.1m moves in 1992 and a peak of 2.1m in 1988. Halifax expects sales next year to remain 'well below the 1.6m to 1.8m level which was the norm for much of the 1980s'. It forecasts that further improvement is likely to be modest with annual sales stabilising at about 1.5m and annual price inflation likely to remain in single figures for the foreseeable future. 'Over a long period of history, house prices have had a fairly stable relationship with earnings. We expect this to continue. The days of boom and bust in the UK housing market are hopefully ended and we are seeing a return to housing being safe if not spectacular investment,' it says. Halifax forecasts that net mortgage lending will rise from Pounds 17bn to Pounds 18bn this year to Pounds 21bn to Pounds 22bn next year. Lending was expected to rise gradually by about Pounds 2bn a year through the 1990s. This would still leave mortgage lending below the 1988 peak of Pounds 40bn.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ HOW THE COST OF BUYING HAS COME DOWN  ------------------------------------------------------------------                      Price     Monthly    Price     Monthly                    in 1989   repayment      now   repayment                     Pounds      Pounds   Pounds      Pounds  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Luton               76,000         620   54,000         280 Bristol             70,000         570   60,000         320 Cambridge           95,000         790   70,000         380 Oxford             100,000         840   73,000         400 Reading             95,000         790   75,000         410 Southampton         75,000         610   55,000         290 Swindon             70,000         570   55,000         290  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Average for semi-detached house bought with 80% loan Halifax Building Society  ------------------------------------------------------------------

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Bargain-seekers encourage retailers' new year hopes 
text:  Bargain-seekers have flocked to Britain's shops for this week's winter sales, continuing the pre-Christmas buying spree and encouraging retailers' hopes of a buoyant 1994. Travel companies said there had been a surge in holiday bookings. 'I would guess we are 60 to 70 per cent up on last year on bookings for summer holidays,' said Mr Russell Amerasekera of Thomas Cook. At Liberty's store in London's Regent Street, whose sale began yesterday, Mr Tony Salem, retail managing director, said: 'I've not seen anything like this for at least four years.' In London and other parts of the UK, stores coped with crowds, though yesterday's snow held back sales in parts of the north of England. The MetroCentre in Gateshead, near Newcastle upon Tyne, had 133,000 visitors on Monday and almost as many yesterday. Sheffield's Meadowhall Centre said Monday had been very busy, with people arriving at 8.30am for breakfast in stores that opened early. 'A number of our stores reported record takes from the first sales day,' said Mr Ron Woodman, MetroCentre's marketing manager. 'There's a move to cash rather than credit.' Shops had even sold plastic Christmas trees to Norwegians, regular visitors to the north-east for winter shopping. Icelandic shoppers were also buying heavily. Mr Salem said overseas shoppers were now more in evidence, with a long queue at Liberty's value-added tax refund counter for export sales. At Selfridges, the department store in London's Oxford Street, Mr Tim Daniels, managing director, said sales figures were better than expected, up by around 10 per cent on last year. 'There seems to be a lot more confidence around,' he said. As in other stores, menswear was particularly sought after. Mr Daniels, who is also chairman of the Oxford Street Association, said other stores in the street, such as Marks and Spencer, had experienced sizeable sales increases. 'The whole street is very strong.' In Selfridge's porcelain and glassware department, the Villeroy and Boch porcelain tableware section reported a threefold sales increase. The store's audio section reported sales of mobile phones up sharply. Like the retailers, Mr Amerasekera at Thomas Cook ascribed the rise in business to a return of consumer confidence. But discounting also played a part. In spite of security alerts, shoppers yesterday streamed into Belfast for the sales. Shops in central Belfast said business was brisker than for many years. Travel agents reported particularly high demand.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Private-sector pay rises 'are continuing to slow' 
text:  Pay increases in the private sector are continuing to slow, says Incomes Data Services, an independent pay monitoring body. But it adds that they are still ahead of those in the public sector, where the government's 1.5 per cent ceiling has held firm. IDS says in research published today that many private-sector wage deals recorded in the fourth quarter have been worth less than 2 per cent. 'This represents a further edging down from levels of settlements which were already very low by the standards of recent decades,' says the report. IDS records the size of pay settlements, but does not cover earnings, which are higher because of bonus pay, overtime and other extras. IDS says public-sector bargaining groups have settled this year within the government's 1.5 per cent limit on the increase in wage bills. As a result, public-sector wage levels have generally trailed those in the private sector. It says that two-thirds of pay deals reported from the private sector since October recorded wage rises between 1 per cent and 2.9 per cent. In the July-September quarter, two-thirds of private-sector settlements were worth 2 per cent to 3.9 per cent. While pay freezes remain uncommon - only three were reported in the last quarter - just three wage deals were worth about 4 per cent or more. IDS says: 'Most current settlements are still comfortably ahead of the cost of living.' The pay databank published by the Confederation of British Industry today shows manufacturing pay deals averaging 2.2 per cent in the three months to the end of November, compared with 2.3 per cent in the previous quarter. But payrolls in manufacturing were up by less than 1 per cent in the year to September, reflecting improved efficiency. Manufacturers cited inability to raise prices and low profit levels as the main constraints on pay. In the quarter to November, pay deals in services were down from 2.6 per cent to a provisional 2.4 per cent. The CBI said pay freezes of up to 12 months had been reported by a quarter of manufacturers and one in six service companies. Incomes Data Services, 193 St John St, London EC1V 4LS.

text:  British Coal yesterday rejected charges of conflict of interest against managers planning to stage buy-outs of pits they have been preparing for privatisation. Mr Kim Howells, Labour MP for Pontypridd, accused managers of enjoying an unfair advantage because of their involvement in the run-up to privatisation. Speaking on BBC radio, Mr Howells, a former researcher for the National Union of Mineworkers, said: 'There is an appalling conflict of interest here. You cannot run (the industry) down and then offer it to management so they can make profits themselves. A lot of people have suffered and a lot of miners have lost their jobs.' His comments came after Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said he would not be surprised if some managers were interested in buy-outs. 'They know a great deal about the business, its risks and its potential,' he said. British Coal said the managers 'have been steering operations to make sure supply matches demand and to make it competitive in a very harsh marketplace. To conclude that the industry has been shrunk to make it easier for the existing management to buy doesn't seem credible.' A number of issues had still to be resolved before managers would be able to mount buy-out offers, British Coal said. The precise split of assets between the five regions named in the coal privatisation bill had still to be decided. The issue of liability for mining subsidence and for health claims from former miners has also yet to be resolved. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said his union would fight privatisation 'in whatever form it takes'.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / North-south divide narrows 
text:  Lower house prices have led to a significant narrowing of house price differentials between different areas of the country, says Halifax. Prices in southern England, hit worst by the recession, are now only 15 per cent above the national average compared with nearly 60 per cent higher in 1988. Northern prices are only 15 per cent below the national average compared with 35 per cent lower five years ago. The society said regional economies and unemployment rates had converged during the recession, so it did not expect price differentials to widen again as the housing market improved. Lower prices and falling interest rates meant that the cost of buying a home had fallen substantially in every region. 'For those in work, earnings have risen by more than 30 per cent over the past four years so the Pounds 280 payment is a much smaller proportion of earnings than it would have been in the late 1980s,' said the society.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Directors upbeat on jobs outlook 
text:  Last month's Budget appears to have boosted optimism among directors about prospects for their businesses in 1994 and may encourage them to increase staff, the Institute of Directors says in its latest business opinion survey. Compared with October, the survey found a slight increase in overall business confidence among a representative sample of 300 of the institute's 33,000 members polled in the last week of November and the first two weeks of December. However, while the Budget had little impact on their overall assessment of the UK economy, those polled after November 30 were markedly more bullish about taking on staff and on the outlook for their companies. The institute said that 47 per cent of directors were more optimistic about the economy in November and December than they were six months before, compared with 42 per cent in October. The balance of those expressing more optimism over those who were less optimistic increased to 32 percentage points from 26 points in October. Although the institute warned that businesses would not be able to assess the full impact of the Budget until April, when tax increases take effect, the Budget appeared to have made good impression the 221 directors interviewed in December. Altogether 61 per cent of those polled after the Budget were more optimistic about the prospects for their own company against 52 per cent immediately before the Budget and 56 per cent in October. The balance of company optimists over pessimists increased to 53 points post-Budget from 34 points immediately before, and 43 points in October. The survey's answers on jobs showed a similar post-Budget rise, with the balance predicting higher employment in their companies increasing to 37 points after the Budget from 19 points in the last week of November and 25 points in October. Mr Peter Morgan, institute director-general, said the survey showed 'cautious but slowly increasing optimism about the economic and business prospects for next year'. He said low inflation and interest rates, falling unemployment and the recent Gatt agreement to lower trade barriers made for an 'extremely encouraging' outlook in 1994. The institute's survey showed that volumes, orders and profits were continuing on a gradual upwards trend with confidence above average in the manufacturing and business services sectors. The biggest preoccupation of directors over the next six months will be maintaining and stimulating demand.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / IRA greets peace pressure with bomb 
text:  The IRA yesterday responded to British pressure to endorse the UK-Irish peace declaration by mounting a low-level bomb attack on a police station in West Belfast. The attack, the third since the IRA ended its Christmas ceasefire with a mortar attack on Monday, occurred around midnight when a small bomb was thrown at a Royal Ulster Constabulary station on Springfield Road, west Belfast. There were no injuries. The bomb followed a warning from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that the IRA would face a renewed security clampdown if it rejected the declaration. Unionist leaders yesterday accused the IRA of seeking to use low-level violence to wring more concessions from the British government. 'This type of violence has been deliberately planned to show that they (the IRA) are capable of very controlled terrorism - each unit seems to be doing one incident in turn,' said Mr Sammy Wilson, a senior official of the hardline Democratic Unionist party. British officials in Belfast denied that they were prepared to make further concessions, and insisted that the initiative now lay with the IRA. The IRA, and its political wing Sinn Fein, are understood to be holding intensive consultations with their members across the province about the response to the peace declaration. But with neither side prepared to make public concessions, and the IRA reported to be increasingly split over the proposals, Sinn Fein yesterday said it would be 'weeks, rather than days' before it issued a formal response. Insisting that Mr Hurd's statement was 'counterproductive', Mr Richard McAuley, a Sinn Fein official, said it had not yet decided about the declaration. 'We have not said 'no', but we have not said 'yes' either,' he said. 'We will not give into this type of pressure from the British government,' he said. Local political sources yesterday said British officials were expected to hold further meetings with republican sources over the next week for further 'explanations' about the peace declaration. A central issue is expected to be IRA demands for political amnesty for its prisoners. But in spite of fears that violence could undermine the peace process, leaders from the Ulster Unionist Party and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party yesterday maintained a cautiously optimistic tone. It said: 'Given the knee-jerk nature of so much of Northern Irish politics, it is probably encouraging that Sinn Fein is taking as long as they are.' Meanwhile, Mr Ken Maginnis, deputy leader of the UUP, dismissed as 'absolute bunkum' reports of a grassroots rebellion in the party over its leadership's endorsement of the peace declaration.

The evacuees, mainly pensioners, war-wounded or mothers with children, boarded three buses returning from an earlier shuttle to the nearby Serb-held district of Lukavica. Most were to go to Split in Croatia, with some going on to third countries. Other evacuees were to go to Serb territory. The long-delayed operation had been blocked several times by fighting along the intended route or by bureaucracy. A month ago, the convoy was abruptly cancelled when Bosnian Croats failed to provide promised buses. An official from the city authorities who organised the evacuation estimated that only about 1,100 of the 1,265 people on the list had actually left. Sarajevo has been under siege by Serb forces since April, 1992. More than 50,000 residents have been killed or wounded by shelling and sniping since the siege began. The Socialists of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic failed to win an overall majority despite a repeat vote in 45 constituencies in Serbia, party officials said yesterday, Laura Silber writes from Belgrade. The party said the new round had not substantially altered the outcome, according to unofficial results.

He will focus on short-comings in services available to UK consumers compared with those in the two other countries. Mr Cruickshank, who visited the US recently, is keen to find out why levels of phone ownership among lower-income groups appear to be markedly higher in the US than in the UK. 'I particularly want to direct our energies to areas where regulation may be stifling innovation,' he said. Mr Cruickshank recently visited several leading US operators including American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, and was 'impressed' by the quality of innovation. Like the UK, the US has a broadly competitive regime for the provision of telecom services. Oftel has chosen France because of its reputation for providing advanced and efficient services even though France Telecom is a state-owned monopoly. Mr Cruickshank's US visit included discussions with politicians and the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator, about the terms for full competition between US and UK operators in each other's markets. The issue is set to be discussed at ministerial level by the US and UK governments during the early months of next year.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Merchant finds fleece can be golden: An elaborate manoeuvre which is used to evade wool marketing controls 
text:  The government's drive to free commodity markets in the UK has led to the abolition of all marketing boards except that for wool - and ministers are coming under pressure to complete the process by getting rid of that as well. Those campaigning against the board have highlighted an elaborate manoeuvre which allows foreign buyers to evade its UK monopoly on the purchase of clip wool - sheep fleeces. But officials argue that the board is necessary to protect small farmers by guaranteeing them a market for fleeces, which are a by-product of sheepmeat production on small farms, and to ensure that the maximum amount of wool comes to market. To avoid the British Wool Marketing Board's controls, Mr Aidan Walsh, an Irish wool merchant, last year brought his lorries, staff and equipment from his base in Naas in County Kildare to Perth. He bought 100 tonnes of wool there, took it back to Naas and then shipped it back across the Irish Sea to the Midlands. Even with transport costs, he can sell wool in the UK more cheaply than domestic merchants who have to buy through the wool marketing board. In May, the Ministry of Agriculture abolished the system of guaranteed prices it used to give farmers through the board. Buyers from outside the UK had been exempt from the board's monopoly on the purchase and sale of clip wool since 1981, and the ending of the guarantee scheme provided an opportunity for them to take advantage of the exemption. In Perth, Mr Walsh offered farmers 40p per kg for wool from blackface sheep, rising to 50p over the summer. This is less than the board price, but it pays over two years - 20p down and the rest the following year. In July, the board won an interdict (injunction) in the Court of Session in Edinburgh preventing Mr John King of the wool merchants J &amp; W Greig of Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, from approaching the farmers because he is not a foreign buyer. Mr King said he was obliged to buy from the board at 81p a kg for blackface wool, including the board's costs of 25p a kg. 'Let's say, for argument's sake, Mr Walsh's transport and other costs amount to 20p a kilo, he can still undercut me when selling to a carpet manufacturer in Britain by 11p a kilo. That is before my own costs,' said Mr King. 'That is some discount. I do not mind Aidan Walsh doing this. It is just that I want to do it myself.' Mr King has lobbied MPs and Mrs Gillian Shephard, Minister of Agriculture, arguing that the board should be abolished. 'The monopolies in eggs and milk have been abolished, why is one being retained in wool?' The ministry argues that most sheep come from small farms, often in remote areas. 'The average clip is 500 kilos. Without the board, a lot of the wool would not reach the market and would have to be imported.' Mr Ian Hartley, deputy managing director of the board, said: 'There are 93,000 suppliers of wool in the UK and only 25 main buyers. You have to have some form of marketing because most farmers are so small. It would not be worthwhile them driving huge distances to deliver.' He says every dealer apart from Mr King is happy to work through the board, although he admits that it must lower its charges to 'well under' 20p a kg. 'Mr Walsh bought 100 tons from about 40 farmers. The total market in Britain is 50m tons. Over 99 per cent of farmers are happy to deal with us. The government wants to continue.' Mr Walsh said: 'This year was a trial run. Next year I am going to set up centres all over Scotland. I know others who are planning to set up in England. The BWMB will break up eventually.'

text:  Israeli and Palestinian negotiators hinted last night they were making progress in their Cairo talks searching for a formula to unblock the Mideast peace process and begin implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 'The talks went very well,' according to Mr Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation team. An Israeli official said: 'They have moved to the stage of wording but it still remains to be seen if the wording will be final.' At one stage Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa joined the discussions between the PLO and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. The talks, which began on Monday night, are due to resume today. The two sides have been deadlocked over who should control border crossings, as well as over the size of the Jericho area to be handed over to Palestinians and over security for Jewish settlers once Israeli soldiers withdraw. Under the peace accord with the PLO, Israel was to have begun moving troops out of Gaza-Jericho more than two weeks ago, but deadlock in negotiations has delayed implementation of the agreement. Meanwhile, pro-Iranian guerrillas launched a wave of attacks on Israel's security zone in south Lebanon, just hours after three Israeli air raids killed two guerrillas. Hizbollah fighters firing machineguns, anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs attacked eight positions of Israeli forces and their allied South Lebanon Army militia. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, earlier accused Syria of not doing enough to prevent attacks by Arab guerrillas on Israeli targets in Lebanon. Despite his accusation, there were signs of a thaw in relations between Damascus and Jerusalem ahead of the summit between President Bill Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad next month. US officials confirmed that Damascus last week issued the first of 850 exit visas to Syrian Jews agreed last month as a confidence-building measure.

text:  Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, is to question Home Office ministers early in the new year about 28 Jamaicans refused entry to Britain on Christmas day. The Labour party said yesterday Mr Blair was concerned about the Home Office's reasons for deporting 28 people who had arrived in Britain on December 21 and were deported from London's Gatwick airport on Christmas day. The party said Labour MPs were particularly concerned about how the Jamaicans were treated in Home Office custody, and the reasons why immigration officials picked out the charter plane on which they had travelled. In Jamaica, the deportation was the subject of official concern, amid indications that the authorities may file a protest to the British government. Some deportees informed the island's foreign ministry officials of their experience, and Mr Paul Robertson, the foreign minister, met Mr Derek Milton, the British high commissioner, to discuss the matter. Jamaican foreign ministry officials said the government would consider carefully the reports of those refused entry, and 'take whatever diplomatic and political steps' it thought appropriate. Some of those refused entry yesterday accused British immigration authorities of 'naked racism'. 'They say that this is normal procedure for people coming into Britain,' said one. 'When was the last time they did that to a plane load of visitors from Australia or New Zealand?'

The creation of the council, first discussed more than 30 years ago, reflects the huge changes which have taken place in Saudi Arabia as a result of its oil wealth and its central role in maintaining stability in the Gulf. The council will initially play an advisory role, but could develop into the main source of new legislation. Its 60 members, who were appointed in September, have been drawn mainly from the professions and more than half have advanced degrees from western universities. They will debate issues referred to them by the council of ministers, headed by King Fahd, but their recommendations will not be binding. Debates will be held in secret and members will not be allowed to remove documents from the council chamber in Riyadh. The creation of the council has come at a testing time for the government, with the fall in oil prices threatening plans both to bring the budget deficit under control and to reduce the worsening current account deficit.

text:  Hammersmith and Fulham council in London said yesterday it would 'vigorously contest' a legal action brought against it by Credit Commercial de France, one of France's biggest banks, which is trying to recover losses it suffered from interest-rate swap agreements. The bank said the council had made 'fraudulent mis-representations' about its power to undertake swap transactions in which two parties agree to exchange fixed and floating-rate interest payments. Hammersmith and Fulham was one of the most active players in the swaps market which it entered 10 years ago, along with other councils, in an effort to find ways around increasing government restrictions on raising finance. Councils generally swapped their fixed-rate liabilities for floating-rate ones - in effect gambling on interest rates staying low - and were left facing substantial losses when interest rates rose at the end of the 1980s. The council denied misrepresentation. It said the legal action appeared to be 'an attempt to enforce swap agreements which the House of Lords declared to be beyond our legal powers'. The French bank said the decision to sue followed a ruling this month by the Court of Appeal, which upheld a High Court order that Islington council must pay Pounds 1.14m to Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German bank. The bank declined to specify the amount it was claiming, but said it sought 'to recover both sums it paid to Hammersmith and Fulham and losses it incurred on matching trans-actions'. It said the 1991 ruling by the House of Lords that local authorities did not have the power to enter into interest rate swaps caused 'enormous losses to the banking community as a whole'. The Lords' decision left 80 banks facing losses of Pounds 560m, some of which they have sought to recover through restitution - reclaiming interest paid to councils under the invalid swap agreements. Hammersmith and Fulham said it had already settled several restitution claims. The council said it was premature to speculate on the position of council-tax payers if the legal action went against the council. So far, its taxpayers have not faced extra bills as a result of the swaps as restitution claims have been met from a special reserve. The action by the French bank is the latest move in a long legal battle between the banks and councils in which Hammersmith and Fulham Council has played a prominent part. It was a participant in several test case actions which have been settled out of court on undisclosed terms. The council took part in a total of 550 transactions in the money markets, mostly in the mid-1980s when it became involved in swap options and other complex transactions. An independent inquiry in 1991 found that Hammersmith and Fulham did not understand the market it had entered and had no way of monitoring or assessing the risks involved.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Singh threatens to quit: The Indian market scandal report that has upset the finance minister 
text:  India has been thrown into political and economic uncertainty by the threatened resignation of Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister and principal architect of the country's wide-ranging economic reforms. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is under intense pressure to reject the resignation of Mr Singh, who offered to quit late last week after the publication of a parliamentary report into last year's Rs40bn (Pounds 856m) Bombay securities market scandal. MPs who wrote the report criticised failings throughout the financial system and held Mr Singh responsible for the shortcomings of officials entrusted with financial supervision. The ruling Congress (I) party, leading Indian business figures and newspapers and foreign companies dealing with India are all urging the prime minister to keep Mr Singh in the government. Supporters of economic reform said his departure would harm India's international reputation. Mr Bansi Dhar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, an employers' body, said: 'The resignation of Mr Singh would be a jolt to the process of liberalisation.' Mr Singh's resignation move was made public late on Christmas Eve, by which time the Bombay Stock Exchange, the country's largest, was already closed. It does not reopen until January 3. However, prices have fallen sharply in out-of-hours deals. The balance of opinion in Delhi last night was that Mr Singh's resignation would be rejected. But much would depend on a parliamentary debate on the scandal, due today and tomorrow. If his record comes under further attack he may quit, even if the prime minister wants him to stay. Mr Singh may also want to hear a whole-hearted statement of support from the prime minister, who has yet to make any public comment on the resignation. Mr Narasimha Rao's position is complicated by the fact that two other ministers are also criticised in the report, both more seriously than Mr Singh. But neither of these two men - Mr B Shankaranand, health minister, and Mr Rameshwar Thakur, rural development minister - wants to quit. Persuading Mr Shankaranand and Mr Thakur to go, while urging Mr Singh to stay, will test even the wily Mr Narasimha Rao's political skills. For 61-year-old Mr Singh such horse-trading could be too much to bear. An academic economist and career bureaucrat, he dislikes dealing with the dirt in Indian politics. Loyal as he is to the prime minister, he is even more loyal to his own sense of honour. He feels deeply hurt by the scandal committee's criticisms; probably nothing less than their withdrawal would fully satisfy him. He has said little about his resignation offer except that reform would continue, even without him. His officials are busy preparing the 1993-1994 budget, due in mid-February, which is expected to contain a new tranche of reforms, including measures to further open financial markets to competition. While a new minister could easily pick up the reins of budget-making in time for February, Mr Singh's departure would damage morale in the ministry because he is so closely identified with the liberalisation programme. Finance Ministry officials have had to fight frequent battles with other ministries to advance reform, and have relied on Mr Singh's support. But what really matters - more than the person of the finance minister  - is the prime minister's and the ruling party's commitment to reform. In his first 18 months in office, Mr Singh achieved much because the mid-1991 economic crisis, when India sought emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund, was so serious that even the most conservative Congress MPs accepted reform was necessary. Import duties were cut, internal controls were partly liberalised and foreign companies made welcome for the first time in over 20 years. Mr Singh and his fellow reformers gradually moved closer to reforming the core of India's economic weakness: its subsidy-pampered farmers, inefficient bureaucracy and overmanned state-owned industry. But they have been forced to hold back from really overhauling these vested interests, because they include some of the Congress party's staunchest supporters. For the past year, the prime minister has been unable to tackle these thorny issues because of the political turmoil caused by the storming of the Ayodhya mosque and the unrest which followed. But, although Mr Narasimha Rao says he fully supports more reform, he has yet to demonstrate a willingness to press ahead with politically difficult changes. Losing Mr Singh might erode his will further.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / HK markets shrug off Beijing snub 
text:  Hong Kong markets yesterday shook off a statement by China that it no longer adhered to the 'through train' concept of Hong Kong politicians serving beyond 1997, when Beijing is to assume sovereignty of the British colony. The stock market's Hang Seng index posted its biggest one-day rise, taking its increase for 1993 beyond 100 per cent. In a statement on Monday, the Beijing government said it had hoped transitional arrangements could have been made on the basis of the principles of convergence with the Hong Kong Basic Law and through negotiations with the British government. 'It is a pity that no agreement has been reached due to deliberate sabotage by the British side,' it said. The 'through-train' idea means legislators and local councillors were to be allowed to serve their full terms, past the change of sovereignty. China said all colonial laws on terms for elected local councillors and legislators would be abolished on July 1 1997, take-over day. The Legislative Council, the municipal councils and district boards should be disbanded and reorganised under the Basic Law, the territory's post-1997 constitution, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing said. The statement followed the breakdown in talks over British proposals for an extended democracy in the colony before 1997. Governor Chris Patten pressed ahead and tabled what were called non-controversial elements of the bill on December 15, after 17 largely fruitless rounds of talks. This set off renewed attack from China. However, observers see Beijing as keeping its options open and the statement as China's latest tactical move in its war of words with Britain. The Hong Kong government said the statement appeared to be in breach of joint commitments to maintain stability and prosperity in the colony. When the market reopened yesterday, the Hang Seng Index reached a record high of 11,570.22, up 530.38 points. It was the biggest one-day rise recorded on the exchange in point terms. The previous record, on December 16, was a jump of 394.40 points. Brokers said foreign funds continued to pour into Hong Kong, stimulated by the new highs on other Asian markets, including Singapore and Malaysia, on Monday. The Hong Kong stock market was closed on Monday. They said investors were undeterred by Beijing's statement as it was already expected the legislature could be dismantled after the handover.

text:  South Korea yesterday said that it was extending negotiations for its Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) high-speed railway project into next year, and that it had asked a German consortium, which had appeared to have lost the battle for the contract, to maintain its offer. The statement seemed to be aimed at putting pressure on GEC-Alsthom, the UK-French transport and engineering group, which is negotiating the high-speed rail contract with the South Korean authorities. GEC-Alsthom, which defeated a consortium headed by Siemens to win the right to negotiate the contract in August, had expected to conclude the deal by the end of this year. Industry observers said that several sticking points remained in the negotiations. These included the terms of technology transfer from the UK-French group to its Korean partners, such as Hyundai Precision Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries. GEC-Alsthom, which builds the French train a grande vitesse (high-speed train), played down the implications of the South Korean decision. 'We remain the priority bidder,' the company said, adding that an extension of negotiations was normal in such an important contract. 'The Korean authorities are trying, perhaps, to increase the pressure on us. That is logical in the course of negotiations,' the UK-French group said. The extension of negotiations and the request to maintain its bid will, however, encourage Siemens and its partners in the German consortium. 'Of course we are still interested,' said an official from AEG, the engineering group which is part of the German consortium. The South Korean contract to build a high-speed line from Seoul to the southern port of Pusan is regarded by the rival groups as a key strategic project, which would leave the winner strongly placed in the international market for high-speed trains. The importance of the contract has prompted fierce competition between GEC-Alsthom and Siemens. The UK-French group was forced to cut its offer price by more than 30 per cent in order to win the right to negotiate the contract.

text:  Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday predicted a national economic upturn by next summer and brushed aside the latest rash of gloomy indicators. 'Although pessimism is prevalent over the prospects for the economy, I take a rather different view,' said Mr Hosokawa. He was speaking four days after unveiling a six-point economic plan for deregulation and tax reform, widely criticised by business leaders as lacking substance. Japan's jobless rate has continued to rise, edging up last month to 2.8 per cent, a six-year high, and a tenth of a point more than in October. The number of people looking for a job continued to rise, by 18 per cent annually, while job offers fell by about the same rate. As a result, the number of jobs per 100 applicants declined to 65 last month, from 93 at the turn of the year. Job losses are worst among women - where employment fell by 0.5 per cent over 12 months - farmers and manufacturing workers. The weak job market has been a continued drag on consumer spending, as shown by a 6.9 per cent decline in sales by large retailers in the year to November. The Tokyo consumer price index rose by a mere 1.3 per cent over that period, as clothing and furniture stores offered big discounts and companies cut entertainment spending. However, the prospects for an increase in industrial employment look remote, as shown by a 3.6 per cent year-on-year fall in industrial output last month, marking a record 26 months of decline. Inventories rose by 0.9 per cent from the previous month, suggesting that companies still need to curb production in line with weak demand. Orders received by Japan's 50 largest construction groups fell by 16.1 per cent last month, from a year earlier, a slowdown compared with the 24.3 per cent drop recorded in October. This was despite an 8.7 per cent rise in housing starts, one of the few bright spots. Japan's gross domestic product (total output of goods and services) grew a revised real 0.4 per cent in 1992-93, after a 3.6 per cent gain the previous year, said the Economic Planning Agency last week. Gross national product (GDP minus net income from overseas production) grew by a real 0.7 per cent in fiscal 1992-93, ended last March, after a 3.6 per cent gain in 1990-91. In nominal terms, GDP rose 2.1 per cent in 1992-93 after a 5.4 per cent rise in 1991-92, and GNP rose 2.4 per cent. Muramoto Construction, subject of Japan's largest post-war financial collapse, has obtained court approval to restructure. The group filed for protection from its creditors early last month, with debts of up to Y590bn, after banks withdrew support. Muramoto's fate, caused by investment in over-valued golf courses in the late-1980s, has led to the collapse of seven suppliers.

text:  Japan's current account surplus shrank by 20.6 per cent in the 12 months to November, the first fall in six months. A finance ministry official said the figures showed that export volumes were levelling off or declining, while import volumes were steadily growing. The fall, to Dollars 8.21bn (Pounds 5.47bn), was larger than most economists had expected from the 5.4 per cent fall in the trade surplus, announced this month. This was because services, not included in the trade account, swung unexpectedly from a surplus of Dollars 1.1bn in November 1992 to a deficit of Dollars 202m last month. A fall in the yen's value against the dollar also played a part. In yen terms, the current account surplus declined more steeply, to Y885.1bn (Pounds 5.32bn), down 30.9 per cent from November last year.

text:  The financial activities of Mr Licio Gelli, controversial head of the secret Italian Masonic lodge, P2, have come under the spotlight following the seizure of more than L16bn (Pounds 6.5m) worth of bank assets held in his name. The assets were seized on Monday under a law permitting magistrates to do so if they suspect the origin of a person's wealth stems from illicit operations. Mr Gelli is the subject of at least three separate criminal investigations. Last year he was sent for trial for alleged links with the Mafia. He has also been linked to some of the murkier episodes in post-war Italian history including the 1982 collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano and the death of the banker Roberto Calvi. However, he has been able to carry on extensive financial activities over the past decade. The move against Mr Gelli promises to begin to lift the veil on the little investigated activities of the Freemason movement in Italy and its suspected connections with organised crime and with the far right and secret services. Mr Lucio Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, said yesterday that Mr Gelli until now had clearly benefited from protection from within the establishment. He also called for a thorough investigation into those banks which had agreed to do business with him. Rome magistrates claim Mr Gelli bought treasury bills and commercial paper from various banks between 1989 and 1992 to the value of L16.4bn. In this period his total declared tax income was L138m. Mr Gelli has denied any wrong-doing.

More than 3.6m shares, each with a face value of Rbs1,000, are on offer in the nationwide auction. Officials said this represented about 18.25 per cent of the company's capital. The auction closes on January 24, when the selling price of shares will be set. Demand on the first day was not particularly strong, officials said. Surgutneftegaz produced 42.5m tonnes of oil (850,000 barrels per day) in 1992, more than 10 per cent of total Russian output. But production is expected to fall sharply this year. Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said yesterday that 'the bulk of privatisation has been completed in the past two years' and that the process was 'irreversible'. President Boris Yeltsin has promised to continue a policy of economic reform despite the nationalist victory at the polls. Last week, he authorised the privatisation agency headed by Mr Chubais to designate insolvent enterprises and open bankruptcy proceedings in arbitration courts. This is not the first time Mr Yeltsin and others have resolved to push ahead with bankruptcies. But, since Russia's bankruptcy law came into force in March, only one small kitchen-knife factory has filed successfully. The presidential decree outlines some practical procedures for the bankruptcy law, but does not set deadlines or require published lists of insolvent enterprises.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / EU ministers wrap up agreement on packaging: But arguments on recycling are set to continue 
text:  Consumers across the European Union could soon be sorting through their household waste to pick out bottles, plastics and other materials for recycling, following an agreement reached by environment ministers before Christmas. The compromise agreement on waste recovery and recycling targets in the EU's directive on packaging and packaging waste will have important consequences for Europe's packaging and waste management industries as well. It was reached after 18 months of wrangling between member countries and lobbying by the packaging industry, which believed original targets in a draft published last year were too severe. The argument, however, is not over. The directive must be ratified by the European parliament, and was opposed by ministers from Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, who were demanding tougher targets. Germany is expected to campaign hard for amendments. After introducing the most ambitious targets in Europe for waste collection and recycling two years ago, it is already exceeding the proposed targets and has been forced to export large quantities of packaging waste after its own recycling industry proved inadequate. The council of environment ministers agreed that within five years of the directive's implementation: Not less than 50 per cent, but no more than 65 per cent, of packaging waste should be recovered rather than simply dumped. A minimum of 25 per cent, and maximum of 40, should be recycled, with a minimum of 15 per cent of each category of material. Within 10 years, the council would have to agree a 'substantial increase' in these percentages. This is somewhat softer than the original draft, which called for 90 per cent of packaging to be recovered within 10 years, with 60 per cent recycled. Moreover, some exemptions were granted to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, because of their geographical position on the fringes of the EU, and their comparatively low consumption of packaging. Ministers also agreed that member countries would be allowed to exceed the targets, but only if this did not lead to a distortion of the European internal market for packaging through those countries exporting the waste. That means a German company, for instance, might be prevented from exporting excess packaging waste to other member states, unless there was a bilateral agreement with a country prepared to take it. The compromise received a cautious welcome from packaging organisations. Mr James Jensen, director general of the Packaging Federation, which represents some of Europe's largest packaging companies, called it a 'victory for common sense'. 'What has emerged is a good balance,' he added. Ms Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of Incpen, the London-based Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment, was more cautious. She said the targets were 'more realistic, more sensible', but the directive faced a rough passage through the European parliament. Mr David Veitch of Procter and Gamble Europe, a member of the executive committee of the European Recovery and Recycling Association, said he was pleased ministers had recognised the need to review the targets later, according to the progress being made and available technology. Reaction in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, has been predictably negative. Mr Hans Alders, Dutch environment minister, said the directive had been so weakened it had 'nothing to do with the environment'. Mr Klaus Topfer, German environment minister and architect of the country's environmental legislation, said the agreement would set back progress on environmental protection in Europe and force Germany to produce more waste. 'It is not supposed to be the EU's job to standardise the environmental tempo in all member states at any price or even to reverse it,' he said. Germany already recycles 66 per cent of its paper, 55 per cent of glass, 48 per cent of tin plate, and 20 per cent of plastics, and has an overall recycling target of 60 per cent by mid-1995. It says Europe as a whole already recycles more than 25 per cent of its packaging material - if figures for glass, recycling of which is well established, are included - and so the new directive may be a harmonising measure, but is not progressive. But France and the UK, in particular, have complained that German waste exports are undermining their domestic waste management companies, which can no longer compete with cheaper waste paper coming across their borders. 'It was very clear to environment ministers in Brussels that the German model needed to be scaled back to meet the concern of member states angered by German waste exports,' said Ms Nacy Russotto, director of the Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe. Officials at the German environment ministry counter that Germany's waste export problems are only temporary as two recycling plants in eastern Germany are due to be functioning next year and will be able to recycle nearly all the waste paper now exported to neighbouring countries.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Roof falls in on Spanish union ambitions: Government has had to step in to save housing empire 
text:  SPAIN'S largest and most belligerent trade union, the socialist General Workers Union (UGT), has been embarrassed by the collapse over Christmas of its housing and financial empire just a month before a general strike it is leading against government reforms of the labour market. Only the despised government, by making new credits available to the UGT businesses, can keep them going and save the union from both financial catastrophe and the anger of thousands of working class families who have joined its co-operative venture to build new homes, mainly around Madrid. Ministers and senior officials have been struggling to contain their delight at the discomfort of the UGT's outgoing leader, Mr Nicholas Redondo, who has led calls for the strike. The government has clearly got Mr Redondo in an awkward position. One barely straight-faced official said earlier this week: 'We make no connection between the strike and the UGT's business troubles.' Two days earlier, the government's official credit institute had agreed to help keep total bankruptcy from the door of the holding company, IGS, with a loan of Pta10bn (Pounds 49m). In return, the UGT has been forced to pledge all its assets - including the Pta10bn property portfolio given to it and other unions after the restoration of Spanish democracy in the late seventies - as a guarantee. IGS and its property co-operative, PSV, have gone into receivership after paying off three big creditors with the help of the government loan. But there are many others. Overall IGS owes more than Pta40bn and at the rate IGS losses are running, the government loan, only Pta1.2bn of which is new money, will not last long. The affair, though not yet tainted with accusations of corruption, bears a disconcerting resemblance to the collapse of Neue Heimat, the huge housing group mismanaged and finally lost in 1987 by the Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund (DGB), the German union federation. IGS and PSV were modelled on the DGB's business ambitions. The DGB was, in fact, an early and short-lived partner in Unial, an insurance company set up by the UGT to try to capture business from members in the early 1980s. But at the time when Neue Heimat was collapsing around the heads of their German cousins, the UGT leaders, and Mr Redondo in particular, let themselves be persuaded that they should become the motor of a huge housing programme for workers and created IGS and PSV along with a private company. The union would supply home buyers and the private sector partner would secure financing. In 1988 IGS had plans to build 5,000 homes. That quickly swelled, along with the UGT's sense of its own importance, to 20,000. IGS created a construction and a mortgage company and a travel club for people who paid up to buy homes or deposited money, in the hopes of getting a home, with IGS. Estimates vary, but it is thought that between 20,000 and 50,000 people have either begun paying or saving for UGT-provided homes. Spanish unions have relatively few members but they were given great property-based wealth and factory-floor power after the end of General Franco's dictatorship. The UGT was also very close to the Socialist government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez when it was first elected in 1982 but has become a political opponent in recent years as government economic policies have drifted to the right. The explosion of speculative ambition at the UGT has a lot to do with the hierarchical structure of the union and the detachment of the union leadership from workplace issues. Union leaders see themselves as big players on the national political scene but their isolation from power recently has forced Mr Redondo especially to seek other ways of political expression. Providing cheap housing for the masses was one way of showing Spain (or perhaps Mr Gonzalez) what he was capable of. General strikes - a success in December 1988 and a flop in 1992, with plans for a third next month - are another. But it is all going badly. If the government is to be believed, the strike on January 27 will not alter its determination to loosen the rigid Francoist labour practices that make it cripplingly expensive to fire workers in Spain. The failure of IGS is probably the final humiliation circumstance will force upon Mr Redondo, who is retiring in 1994. It was he who first propelled Mr Gonzalez to the leadership of the Socialist party in 1974 while it was still in exile. Now the two men do not speak. Now, as angry IGS 'clients' clamour for their money outside IGS headquarters in Madrid, Mr Gonzalez is sure to be working hard to wrest maximum political benefit from the UGT's financial straits, by securing before January 27 the savings and hopes of the home buyers who put their faith in the UGT. A government-inspired rescue of IGS will not avert the planned strike but it will nicely blur the picture that unions have drawn of him as a waster of public money and a destroyer of dreams.

text:  The Russian government has moved to speed up bankruptcies next year as part of its economic reforms. President Boris Yeltsin, who has promised to continue reform despite the nationalist victory at the polls, has authorised the privatisation agency headed by deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais to designate insolvent enterprises and open bankruptcy proceedings. This is not the first time Mr Yeltsin and others have resolved to push ahead with bankruptcies. But since Russia's bankruptcy law came into force in March, only one small kitchen-knife factory has filed successfully. Though the presidential decree outlines some practical procedures for the bankruptcy law, it does not set deadlines or require published lists of insolvent enterprises. The decree must also be reviewed by the new parliament. Mr Chubais said he hoped for success in discussions on co-operation with parliament's other main pro-reform bloc, headed by market economist Grigory Yavlinsky, against nationalists and Communists. Mr Chubais acknowledged yesterday that Russia's privatised companies had changed little in the way they operated. 'It would be very naive to expect that after the first day of privatisation a state enterprise would cut its production costs four times and double its profits,' he said. Communist Party member Anatoly Lukyanov, on trial for his role in the August 1991 failed Soviet coup, was 'almost unanimously' elected chairman of the temporary co-ordination commission of the new parliament.

text:  The Clinton administration yesterday turned the heat up in a dispute with Japan over semiconductor trade, suggesting Japan was reneging on an international agreement, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Lawrence Summers, the Treasury's undersecretary for international affairs, said during a Cable News Network interview that Japanese companies were still discriminating against US suppliers and it was time they stopped. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, had earlier called for emergency talks with Japan after a report of a new drop in Japan's purchase of foreign semiconductors. In the fourth quarter of 1992, Japan bought 20.2 per cent of its semiconductors from foreign sources, but the share fell for the third quarter of this year to 18.1 per cent. 'This latest share number raises serious concerns regarding Japan's commitment to fully implement the semiconductor arrangement,' Mr Kantor said. The accord calls for Japan to improve its market share of foreign semiconductors to an average 20 per cent. Mr Kantor said a meeting next month would consider a joint plan to 'improve dramatically foreign share and access' to Japan's market. However, Mr Hidehiko Yoshida, chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan's committee that monitors foreign semiconductors, said yesterday that foreign chip suppliers' sales in Japan in the April-September period of 1993 were up by 26 per cent, or Dollars 4.5bn, from a year earlier. 'The market share figures do not fully reflect the efforts of Japanese users,' he said.

headline:  FT  29 DEC 93 / Belgium bows out to applause: Widespread praise for six-month spell presiding over EU 
text:  As Belgium prepares to hand over the rotating presidency of the European Union to Greece on January 1, the coalition government in Brussels is basking in praise for its six-month stewardship of the EU. The European Commission said this week that the Belgian presidency had been active and productive, a view generally shared among the permanent delegations in Brussels. Achievements include a delicate brokering role which helped to conclude the world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; a deal on the location of almost a dozen European institutions, including the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt; a share-out of development funds; and much unglamorous but necessary work implementing the Maastricht treaty. Belgium's performance defied predictions that its presidency would prove ineffective because of a weak coalition government, linguistic divisions and labour unrest. Despite the regular presence of dozens of anti-riot trucks in Brussels in the past half year, fears that the government might fall in the face of opposition to its 'social pact' - the most ambitious austerity programme since the second world war - proved unfounded. As a founder member of the European Community in 1958 and one of the smaller EU states, Belgium has become used to subordinating its own national interests to achieve compromise. In this respect, says Mr Peter Ludlow, head of the Brussels-based Centre for European Studies, Belgium's has been 'a model presidency'. Personalities count, too. Though occasionally irascible, Mr Willy Claes proved an effective chairman of the general affairs council comprising EU foreign ministers; and Mr Philippe Maystadt showed why he is one of the more respected finance ministers in Europe. Both benefited from the advice of Ambassador Philippe de Schoutheete de Tervarent, Belgium's long-serving permanent representative to the EU. It was Mr Claes and Mr de Schoutheete who helped to keep France within the European fold during the Gatt trade talks, taking the sting out of relations between Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, and Sir Leon Brittan, the chief trade negotiator. Similarly, both men calmed down European parliamentarians and persuaded them to compromise on a new accord governing the roles of EU institutions post-Maastricht. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious prime minister, and Mr Claes are also credited with buoying up a moody Mr Jacques Delors before he delivered his white paper on growth and competitiveness to acclaim at the Brussels summit this month. Criticism of the Belgian presidency focuses on the less-than-smooth running of second-tier EU councils such as environment, agriculture and research. The 'green-leaning' Danes, Dutch and Germans were also unhappy about the compromise on waste packaging which they argue will damage the environment. Like its predecessors, the Belgian presidency proved unable to make real progress in the Bosnian conflict. Talks this week in Brussels identified some points of agreement; but Mr Claes was reduced to describing as 'pathetic' Bosnian Serb excuses for not reopening Tuzla airport to allow resumption of humanitarian aid to starving refugees.

text:  Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, said yesterday he was ready to leave office, having completed his government's mandate. The 73-year-old former governor of the Bank of Italy also told a news conference he would not stand in forthcoming general elections. Mr Ciampi's comments are in line with promises made in May when he agreed to be Italy's first non-elected premier this century. Then, he said his two essential tasks were to obtain approval for an austerity budget for 1994 and to complete the process of electoral reform. Both were achieved just before Christmas. However, Mr Ciampi was careful yesterday to point out that the decision on the dissolution of parliament was out of his hands. 'This executive has no authority to decide whether or not the current legislature should be prolonged. . . This is in the hands of the head of state having consulted with the heads of the senate and chamber of deputies.' The timing of his departure has been complicated by intense backstage political manoeuvring in the past few days. Originally, it had been expected that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro would announce the dissolution of parliament in his end-of-year address, fixing at the same time a date for early general elections in March. This timetable had now been undermined by Mr Marco Panella, the Radical leader, who just before Christmas managed to persuade many of the current Christian Democrat-led majority in parliament to sign a motion of no confidence. This was sufficient for President Scalfaro to postpone any statement and arrange for a week-long parliamentary debate beginning on January 12. The aim of the no confidence motion was to prolong the life of parliament as long as possible, perhaps as late as June with a new government installed to replace Mr Ciampi. This would give more time for the disintegrating Christian Democrats and other groupings to form a viable alliance to oppose the electoral prospects of a coalition dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left. President Scalfaro is reported against such a solution and the debate may not be a formal no confidence motion if a number of Christian Democrats can be persuaded to withdraw their support. Nevertheless, Mr Ciampi in his closing days has been placed in an awkward position in relation to the parties that have notionally been backing his administration.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / A different tune for electronics in Japan: Sony and Matsushita have reported profit falls 
text:  After years of strong growth, Japan's mighty consumer electronics giants have run up against a wall. Faced with recession in international markets, Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony, the largest and second largest consumer electronics groups in the world respectively, yesterday reported large profit falls and said they would be scaling back their capital investment programmes. Matsushita reported a fall in operating profit of 18 per cent to Y389bn (Pounds 1.64bn) as it was hit by foreign exchange losses of Y62.1bn. Pre-tax profit fell 39 per cent to Y363.4bn and after-tax profit declined 49 per cent to Y132.9bn. Sony reported a 44.1 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profit to Y166.3bn on a 5.7 per cent increase in sales at Y3,821bn. Net profit rose 2.7 per cent to Y120.1bn, but was boosted by the proceeds of a public offering by Sony Music Entertainment (Japan), which raised Y61.5bn. The extent of Sony's difficulty was highlighted by a fall in the group's parent operating loss to Y20.5bn from a profit of Y72.2bn, and the company's first loss since its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958. Consumer electronics manufacturers worldwide have been hit by their failure over the past few years to stimulate consumer demand with exciting new products while large markets in industrialised countries are already saturated with colour TVs and audio equipment. Even in Japan, 'the consumer electronics market has been flat for the past five years', says a spokesman for Matsushita. The leading companies in the industry have seen the difficult times coming for some years. Since the mid-1980s there has been growing concern about the lack of new products to stimulate consumer demand. But attempts to introduce model changes and, in the case of Matsushita and Sony, by buying into prominent US entertainment companies, have not been as successful as they would have liked. The results of Matsushita and Sony were affected by their need to digest the acquisitions, of, respectively, MCA and Columbia Pictures, although Matsushita boosted consolidated sales 13 per cent to Y7,449.9bn, thanks to MCA revenues of Y480bn. Meanwhile, efforts to stimulate demand by introducing new product models at the frenetic pace of once every six months have backfired. Japanese consumers are no longer fooled by such gimmicks while the country's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has warned the manufacturers that frequent model changes were an unnecessary waste of resources and labour time. Matsushita said sales of video equipment remained flat at Y1,699.8bn, while audio equipment sales rose 6 per cent to Y631.7bn. Home appliances grew 9 per cent to Y982.2bn, communication and industrial equipment sales advanced 8 per cent to Y1,678.6bn, while electronic components rose 3 per cent to Y862.7bn. Revenue from entertainment, including films and music entertainment, video and audio tapes, totalled Y626.4bn. However, Matsushita said revenues at MCA, which were included into the sales figures starting last fiscal year, fell 4 per cent because of the shortage of box-office hits. Sony reported a 1.3 per cent decline in video equipment sales to Y896.4bn, in spite of a 6.7 per cent fall in the final quarter. For the year, audio equipment sales rose 7.5 per cent, televisions 7.3 per cent and filmed entertainment 27.8 per cent, while music entertainment fell 7.4 per cent. The consumer electronics industry does not expect to see a marked improvement until later in the year while products which they are placing their hopes on, such as digital audio tapes and interactive video systems, are being introduced only this year and will take some time to attract widespread demand. Both companies hope that the release of new products in the domestic market and a recovery in the US and Europe will lift sales during the current year. For the current year to next March, Matsushita expects consolidated pre-tax profits to rise 6 per cent to Y385bn, on a marginal increase in sales of 0.7 per cent to Y7,500bn. Sony expects a 2 per cent increase in sales at the parent company to Y2,020bn and a 45 per cent increase in net profit to rise 45 per cent to Y30bn, while research and development spending is likely to rise from Y240bn to between Y245bn and Y250bn.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Supermarket group makes accounting policy change 
text:  WM MORRISON Supermarkets, the Bradford-based grocery chain, yesterday announced a significant change to its accounting policies by choosing to depreciate its land assets. The company said the change was prompted by the 'interest of prudence' recognising that the alternative use value of its sites might be much less than their food retailing value. The move could increase shareholder pressure on other food retailers to follow suit, threatening a big dilution in their earnings. The share prices of all the leading food retailers were unsettled yesterday. Morrison slipped 5p to 369p, while J. Sainsbury fell 7p to 458p, Tesco shed 6p to 274p and Argyll Group, which runs Safeway, slid 6p to 351p. Mr Tony Shiret, food retailing analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'The fact that Morrison's has acknowledged the argument on alternative value will put the other food retailers under increased institutional pressure to do likewise.' He argued in a recent circular that big food retailers were significantly overvaluing property portfolios by failing to provide for such depreciation. 'In a high-inflation environment this policy was considered appropriate as inflation offset any diminution in the underlying value of the asset. We have now moved to a low inflation environment with many of the more recently acquired assets staring at uncomfortably high valuations,' he argued. Mr Shiret estimated that the effect of adopting 'prudent' depreciation policies would depress Tesco's earnings per share in the year to spring 1993 by 21 per cent. J. Sainsbury would suffer a 15 per cent reduction and Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway chain, an 11 per cent dilution. Asda is expected to announce a substantial write-down on its property assets when it reports its results this summer. Mr Kenneth Morrison, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that the company would depreciate all land, whether in use or not, by 1 per cent a year from the beginning of the financial year. He added it would have had the effect of reducing last year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.6m by about Pounds 1m.

text:  MR Michael Julien is to step down as chief executive of the Storehouse retailing conglomerate on his doctors' advice after being unable to shake off a viral infection he contracted last year. He will be succeeded by Mr David Dworkin, currently chairman and chief executive of the BhS subsidiary, after the company's annual meeting in July. The announcement came as Storehouse, which also embraces Mothercare, Habitat, Richards, and Blazer, reported an encouraging turnround in its trading fortunes after four consecutive years of declining profits. In the year to March 28, Storehouse more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 15.8m on sales 2 per cent lower at Pounds 1.18bn. The improvement was rewarded by a 3p rise in its share price to 140p. Last year's figures were, however, flattered by the absence of any exceptional costs. In the previous year, Storehouse took a Pounds 14.8m exceptional rationalisation charge and a Pounds 24.3m extraordinary loss on disposals. Profits from retail operations were Pounds 10m last year compared with Pounds 19.2m the year before. However, Mr David Simons, finance director, said the group had experienced a significant trading improvement in the second half of the year and was showing clear signs of recovery. The trend had continued over the first few weeks of the current year, he added, with group sales running at 7 per cent higher than a year ago. Mr Simons attributed the pick-up in sales to internal improvements made at Storehouse rather than to a general strengthening of consumer sales. BhS was the biggest contributor turning a first-half deficit into a Pounds 500,000 advance to Pounds 22.1m by the year end. But Mothercare saw a reversal in its fortunes falling from a Pounds 6.8m profits into a Pounds 3.9m loss. Habitat reduced losses from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 8.8m. Earnings per share rose from 1p to 2.6p. The final dividend was held at 2.5p maintaining the yearly payout at 5p. Storehouse said this reflected its financial strength and optimism for the future. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, yesterday paid tribute to Mr Julien's achievement in strengthening the company's finances and refocusing the group's operations.

text:  There were grounds for mild optimism in Storehouse's annual results. The return to profit was mainly thanks to a second-half bounce in the BhS chain which Mr David Dworkin has done much to improve. Now promoted to chief executive, he should be able to work the same trick at Mothercare, but the benefits will take time to accrue. Habitat, which lost Pounds 9m last year, remains an uglier proposition. Its US operation looks a prime candidate for closure. That could leave the way open for a sale of the remaining French and UK assets to management which would effect an immediate Pounds 10m boost to profits. Whatever happens, the market has been too enthusiastic about the group's shares. After outperforming the sector by nearly 30 per cent this year, they are on the same forward rating as those of Marks and Spencer. Yet Storehouse made a mere Pounds 10m of trading profit on Pounds 1.2bn of turnover; five years ago, profit was Pounds 130m on similar turnover. At present rates of progress, the dividend will be barely covered this year. Storehouse still has much to prove.

text:  It is easy to lose count of the number of times EC farm ministers have definitively tamed the Common Agricultural Policy. As recently as the spring of 1988, Brussels was celebrating an historic accord to apply self-correcting price cuts and production limits once cereal and livestock surpluses showed signs of spinning out of control. Within 18 months it was obvious that this system was yet another in a long line of inadequate responses. To be fair the 29 per cent cereal price cut which forms the centrepiece of yesterday's deal is deeper than anything hitherto contemplated, while the principle of paying direct income support for farmers is a genuine breakthrough. That said, there is still a danger that the politicians will be grappling with some of the same issues four or five years down the line. The explanation lies in doubts about whether the latest medicine is really harsh enough, and whether farmers will gratefully cash their compensation cheques and seek to increase output on land which is not taken out of production. The headline 'set aside' target of 15 per cent will be more like 10 per cent in practice, and could be equivalent to 6-7 per cent on the assumption that farmers choose to give up their lowest yielding land. With productivity worth 2 per cent a year EC cereals output could be back to current levels in four years' time. If food processors are to maintain their profitability they will have to respond to lower input costs with higher trading margins. Much will depend on the competitive balance between manufacturers and retailers. Branded products should be at an advantage, but in fragmented sectors like poultry the likes of Sainsbury and the consumer will be in a position to take more of the spoils.

text:  Yesterday's Bank of England figures on sterling lending to the M4 private sector contain something for everybody. Bulls of the economy will doubtless claim that April's Pounds 5.1bn leap shows credit demand started to pick up after the election. Bears will point to the notoriously unreliable seasonal adjustment. April's growth followed a Pounds 400m fall in March. That could suggest borrowing was deferred until after polling day. More likely the series is simply erratic. Separate figures from the British Bankers' Association appear to offer some support for the optimistic school. Although there is certainly no sign of a recovery in construction and property lending, there is a faint stirring of activity in the manufacturing sector as well as in the wholesale and retail distribution trades. The figures for corporate borrowing must be treated with some caution, since prior weakness in the lending aggregate partly reflected a switch of borrowing activity to the bond market. Net corporate borrowing in the bond market was sharply down in April. So perhaps companies were simply turning back to their banks because the government was hogging the limelight in the bond market. The BBA says bank lending on house purchases is not much above the level of recent months. That suggests there is not much building society component to the official money supply figures either. Had there been a sharp rise in house lending in April, estate agents would surely have been trumpeting the turnround in the market in February. All in all, the figures point to a weak recovery at best.

text:  Yesterday's annual figures from BT provided a model of regulator and investor relations. Other unloved monopolies, notably British Gas, would do worse than take notes. The novel, if tiny, fall in BT's pre-tax profits and the more substantial slippage of its rate of return were elegant reminders that the regulatory regime has indeed begun to bite. At the same time, the 8 per cent dividend increase and assurance that the payout will not be directly linked to a declining earnings stream were designed to keep shareholders sweet. Given that Oftel is shortly to complete a review of BT's prices, the company has played a canny hand. Consumers will doubtless be hoping it has not outplayed the regulator entirely. Oftel's problem is how seriously it should take yesterday's figures as a guide to the future. While the present price formula is certainly hurting BT - fourth quarter earnings per share fell by 12 per cent - it is not clear that it should be eased just because inflation has fallen. BT still has plenty of scope for job cuts and will continue to generate huge amounts of cash. But Oftel must also consider its general policy of encouraging competition. Unless Sir Bryan Carsberg's successor intends a radical shake-up of the entire UK industry, the likes of Mercury will find it harder to wrest market share if BT's price cap is too harsh. Oftel might favour a gentler cap in return for giving competitors better terms of access to BT's network. BT shares rose by 2 per cent yesterday, mainly because the market was pleased by the prospect of a smaller than expected charge from the redundancy programme to this year's profits. Were the pricing review to be favourable, the shares could rise a lot further again.

text:  Your leader ('Reform of the pension funds', May 11) rightly highlighted the need for reform of the current occupational pensions framework. I fear that tinkering with the existing structure, such as extending the 'Club' transfer model as suggested by Mr Redman (Letters, May 13) complicates matters. The final salary legislative framework that has evolved is already so complex that the vast majority of its beneficiaries do not comprehend it and it needs its own 'industry' to translate it. Potentially, money purchase schemes have the merit of simplicity - and do not suffer from the cross-subsidies and questions of ownership that plague final salary schemes. Investment risks exist but these can be minimised. More importantly, the members undeniably benefit from favourable investment performance. Unfortunately, occupational money purchase schemes remain subject to many of the final salary benefit restrictions and other legal requirements. Company-sponsored personal pensions plans, with freedom of investment, offer a far simpler and flexible solution - but a change to the Financial Services Act legislation is needed to enable employers actively to 'promote' such schemes. This step, along with the introduction of some safeguards such as restrictions on the marketing of high-cost products and controls on commission levels, would go a long way to solving the inequities and other recently exposed limitations of final salary schemes.

Chris Tighe's report rightly cited Enron's huge new gas-fired power station at Wilton as the main catalyst and suggested that completion of the upgraded lines by National Grid would enable that plant's net output to be sold into the electricity pool. In fact, in the name of competition, Prof Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of electricity supply, in September 1990 gave National Grid written derogation from its proper licence conditions on transmission standards for the connection of new plant in respect of the Greystones (Enron) station. This will enable the plant to sell its output before the disputed lines are ready, under conditions of reduced system security. The liberated market place therefore gives rise not only to environmental concerns, as voiced at the Northallerton inquiry, but also to fears of degraded security of supply. It was only a few years ago that the Department of Energy confirmed at the Hinkley Point inquiry that transmission security was an integral part of overall security of electricity supply, but that message, like the department itself, is being forgotten.

text:  Sir, Malcolm Craig is widely off the mark and totally inaccurate when he writes of 'hotch-potch' training in the construction industry. Construction, which employs one in 10 of Britain's workforce, has developed a highly disciplined, properly integrated and, more to the point, employer-led training base. Led by the Construction Industry Training Board, it has the biggest youth training programme of any industry in Britain, and YT has long been accepted as the preferred method of entry training for craft workers. More than 165,000 young people have been through the scheme under the CITB's managing agency, training for up to two years in very specific industry-related occupations. Today we are training some 16,000, despite the recession. Periods of instruction and supervised practice at a college or training centre alternate with periods under supervision on site. These on-site periods are generally spent with the trainee's sponsoring or employing company in order to give practical experience of day-to-day working techniques and conditions. There are 30 individual skills and occupations for which the CITB provides YT programmes. Until now, most of those completing the programme have gone on to gain City and Guilds craft qualifications after further training under apprentice-type arrangements. We expect most of those who complete the programme in future to achieve the construction national vocational qualifications now jointly awarded by the CITB and City and Guilds. Equally important, more than 90 per cent of those who have finished the programme have remained in the industry in permanent jobs. Surely evidence enough to confirm that their training has been wholly relevant, and not hotch-potch.

Yet, the Labour party: increased its number of MPs and percentage of the vote for the third consecutive election; reduced the government's previously large majority; cut into the Liberal Democrat vote; came within 1,000 votes of victory in 17 seats. While, obviously, Labour lost the election, some analysis of the real losers  -the continuing post-1983 decline of the Lib Dems and Paddy Ashdown's strategy of replacing Labour by the Lib Dems, is needed.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Major's chance to take a lead in the east 
text:  Nothing prepares you for your first sight of Budapest. I offer this thought to Mr John Major, who will come here for the first time next week, following his maiden visits to Poland and Czechoslovakia. The bit western first-timers see is close to home, with its excellent hotels, its range of shops from Benetton to McDonald's and its many imported cars. The British prime minister will probably not have the necessary hours to spare for an excursion down the Danube; if he did, he would take notice of the boat houses and dachas that, with their owners at play in the sun last weekend, reminded me of Florida's waterways. Stand on the riverside in Pest and contemplate the wealthy suburbia in the hills of Buda and you could persuade yourself that all the talk of a new third world on the European Community's eastern border is misplaced; that, rather, this is one of the fairest cities in what will surely become the Greater West. The fancy could be elaborated. The democratically elected coalition government includes Christian Democrats. It appears to be conservative, cautious, apparently suited to Mr Major's taste. There is a functioning opposition and a free press. The rule of law is slowly being re-established. The prime minister, Mr Jozsef Antall - a comfortingly grey personality - has maintained stability during these difficult early stages of establishing a parliamentary democracy. Hungary is the most popular eastern destination for western private capital. Foreign investment is pouring in, not only from Germany and Austria but also from the US and even Britain. Earnings from tourism and foreign trade are rising rapidly. Mr Major will not wish to be bamboozled by the stage set components of this picture. His Foreign Office brief will surely prevent that; alternatively, common sense should be enough. The Hungarians deserve help and encouragement, but this should not be allowed to disguise the fact that they are only in year three of what could be a generation-long struggle to build a prosperous, free and open society. Away from the shops and restaurants of central Budapest, the visitor finds dark rows of ill-maintained buildings; away from the capital itself the low standard of living of many Hungarians is evident. On one rough estimate, 30 per cent of the people are better off than they were under the communists, about a fifth are living at about the previous standard and the remaining half are worse off. Unemployment is rising: it could reach 15 per cent this year, according to the Economic Research Institute. Inflation is falling, but might still end up at 25 per cent in 1992. Productivity, national output and consumption are all decreasing. The anecdotal evidence is of families crowded in dingy flats, widespread job losses and, in compensation, the flourishing of a black economy first developed under communist rule. The new democracy's roots are fragile, and in thin soil. Plum positions are still allocated on an old boy network; former communists get their disproportionate share. Civil society, with its plenitude of independent institutions, has been corrupted over the past 40 years; it could not be re-established overnight. Most of the politicians are painfully inexperienced. Their factional quarrels, shown on television, have disenchanted a public for whom, in some quarters, there is a nostalgia for the certainties of communist rule. The turn-out in recent by-elections has fallen below 20 per cent. Mr Antall, accused by his opponents of incipient authoritarianism, clearly has no patience with the partisanship of the opposition press. His attempts to treat the heads of the official radio and television networks as paid employees of a politicised civil service have been frustrated by the president and the constitutional court. It is not the third world, but it is not the first either. Yet it undoubtedly belongs within the west European family. Mr Major's primary task next week is to assure the heads of the Polish, Czechoslovak and Hungarian governments that he not only believes this, but that when Britain assumes the presidency of the European Community in a few weeks he will behave as one who regards their eventual full membership as certain. As Mrs Margaret Thatcher said in Bruges in September 1988: 'We must never forget that, east of the Iron Curtain, peoples who once enjoyed a full share of European culture, freedom and identity have been cut off from their roots. We shall always look on Warsaw, Prague and Budapest as great European cities.' This makes Mr Major's task clear, but awkward. He must affirm EC and UK support and sympathy while yet reminding his hosts in all three capitals of what it takes to become a thriving democracy. Mr Antall is most at home in German; his relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl is close. The Hungarian prime minister may accept private advice from Bonn but is unlikely to respond well to anything that would resemble public preaching from London. He might, characteristically, defend himself by emitting a cloud of verbiage, most notably on the bloodshed in Yugoslavia, where many Hungarians are trapped by the war. He can present his republic as a tranquil island in a potentially inflamed central Europe. Yet Hungary sees eventual EC membership and the protection of a European security umbrella as the principal aims of its external policy. This is the logic of its history: it has ever been the vassal, the colony, or the client state of one or another giant neighbour. It does not wish to repeat the experience. It can thus reasonably be kept aware of the necessary qualifications for membership of the various European clubs. Press freedom is one of them. The International Press Institute, meeting in Budapest this week, urged political leaders in former communist countries to accept a free role for the media, since the new governments would be judged on their attitudes to political expression. Mr Major will see the value of reinforcing this message. To leave it at that would, however, be to lose an historic opportunity. With President Bush pre-occupied with his election campaign and the French president and the German chancellor both weakened by domestic political difficulties, the British prime minister is in a unique position to propose a new course for western policy in the post-communist age. We knew what we wanted in the half-century after Yalta: it was to roll the Soviets back. But now someone has to explain, in language as vivid as Mrs Thatcher would use, why it is in our interest to move the boundaries of the west eastwards over the coming decades.

You had to use the video recorder at 9.00 either for Rory Bremner, now much our best impressionist, on BBC2, or for Cheers on Channel 4, though admittedly this series set in a Boston singles bar currently consists of repeats. At 10.00 came one of the week's funniest programmes, the game show based on recent news stories, Have I Got News For You (BBC2), followed promptly by Clive Anderson Talks Back on C4 at 10.30. All that is still the case, and now what have they done? Added a new series on BBC1, Joker In The Pack, in which Marti Caine introduces 'ordinary people with a natural joke-telling talent'. This, too, takes the form of a game show, with competing teams in the studio and the audience joining in with favourite jokes. However, the most remarkable of Friday's funny programmes are usually Made In The USA in which Laurie Pike illustrates some of the wilder aspects of Amerika by way of clips from cable television (11.10 C4); and Married With Children, an American sitcom which exults in pre-political correctness attitudes.

text:  Richard Eyre's production of the bloody tragedy is back again at the National, before it tours America. No doubt the Minnesota audience will find it as impressive as Londoners have done; but they will find it a longer sit, too, for they are going to miss a great many lines. Not because the text is badly spoken; indeed it is very well spoken - but also, deliberately, 'well-spoken' in the classy modern-English sense. Across the Atlantic, those squeezed vowels and juiceless consonants (as affected by certain upper-middle circles, J. Arthur Rank actors and theatrical knights) will cry out for surtitles. It is an under-remarked fact that whereas 'good' French, Italian or Spanish is distinguished by its clarity, 'good' British English has the phonetic marks of a rancid provincial dialect. Eyre wanted those voices because his Richard is set critically in the England of some 50 years ago. That was when Brecht was raiding Shakespeare's play for his Hitler-play, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui; Eyre repays the compliment by rendering the original as if it were the 'Ui' story. Where Brecht fingered German industrialists and aristos as the collaborators who smoothed Ui/Hitler's path, Eyre presents Richard's partners and victims as the modern Establishment who might have let Fascism into Britain. In the black spaces and the stark industrial lighting devised by Bob Crowley and Jean Kalman, it makes a terrific show. There are losses, but one almost forgets them in the dazzling glare of Ian McKellen's star Richard, crisply supported by a large and skilful team. Here, Richard's differently-abledness takes the form of galloping alopecia and stiff left limbs, compensated by a prehensile right hand that does tricks no less hypnotically fascinating than Antony Sher's famous spider-crutches. McKellen's demise is extended into one-legged ballet of a rare virtuoso order. This Richard in his time plays many parts, starting with the grim, self-regarding persona of some Second World War Generalissimo - rendered with such fruity gruffness that even from the fifth row I had to fill in some lines from memory. Little by little, the tics and twitches begin to seem generated from some desperate inner stress. Where Olivier wielded a monstrous glamour and played teasingly with his various prey, McKellen offers a brilliant solo study: it exerts an implacable grip, but reduces the other characters to abject, terrorised victims. They do what they can, but until the interval the audience responded to all their griefs as to black comedy. We were intrigued, not moved. There was no perverse erotic spark in Richard's wooing of Lady Anne (Anastasia Hille), and for Buckingham the prescribed Establishment mutter dampened Terence Rigby's solid, wary grandee. Only later, when the royal ladies went splendidly into passionate-denunciation mode, did we begin to feel for the losers. On the final scenes, Peter Darling's Richmond who will be Henry VII  -bestows a dewy sitcom sweetness that shifts the action fast-forward into the 1980s. Lyttelton Theatre, to May 26

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Avant-garde ball for Cinderella - Vienna Festival 
text:  The great, the good and the frankly pretentious from the theatrical avant-garde have descended on Vienna in equal measure this year. As Europe's showcase for radical drama, the Festwochen lays down no rigid themes, but over the days connections emerge: this time an emphasis on classic archetypes, from fairy tale to Shakespeare, controversially updated. The hot news from week one is that the new English production Cinderella, adapted by Tony Britten and Nick Broadhurst from Rossini's La Cenerentola, is star of the show and one of the most dazzling examples of contemporary revision which, through images drawn from our own social reality - the Ferrari, Essex Man - revitalises the essential myths love and forgiveness, power and control, survival - of the original. Britten and Broadhurst are founders of Music Theatre London, the opera ensemble which casts actors and singers, rather than opera singers, in witty new translations of opera-drama. Their Cinderella opening out-shocks Opera Factory's 1980s bikini Cos fan tutte: The ugly sisters, played i travesti by Simon Butteriss in a butch pink swimsuit and by William Renton in a froth of petticoats, lounge on the diving board of a pool and swap transvestite fantasies about Prince Ramiro's ball. Cinders flames the plastic red barbecue and fixes the sunshades on the Costa-del-Basildon villa guarded by a life-size ceramic Rottweiler. Dad, Don Magnifico, is Essex Man, floral braces, gold pyjamas, east London accent intact ('who was that bimbo who turned up?' he asks at the ball), boastful/deferential in his philistine sneering. In Tim Hardy's parody, comic yet menacing, the violence to Cinderella clearly stems from his own repression. His opposite is philosopher Alidoro, Oxbridge charmer (Kevin Colson), who offers himself as alternative father. Freudian implications, the girl's longing for her unattainable father, are thus embodied: Alidoro the ideal, Don Magnifico the monster. Interwoven is class warfare. Social disguise is the key in both Perrault and Rossini, where Ramiro swaps roles with his valet. Here Dandini (Harry Burton) is the chauffeur rigged up as HRH in a kilt, attended by tartanned royals. Ramiro (soprano Gaynor Miles), the 'choufleur d'amour' pondering his/her sexuality completes a kinky pantomime trio: the i travesti roles bring out sexual as well as social undercurrents. It is romance within a post-Thatcherite parable of the rise and fall of the self-made man. Flimsy as his Cindy-doll-by-the-pool home, Don Magnifico has no chance once pitted against the royals (his 'get yer arses down ere' evokes another classic English social satire, Eliza at the races in My Fair Lady). Revealed as a bankrupt, he is saved from repossession by Old Money when Cinderella, in a stream of quicksilver lyricism from Jan Hartley Morris, marries her prince. With an onstage orchestra of eight jazzing up Rossini, this is a vintage 1990s show, set in a broken golden arch it blazes with deconstructionist wit; Alidoro, a Prospero-Zarusthro figure, fashions paper hearts during the love duets and remote controls a toy Ferrari, driven by models of Ramiro and Dandini, across the stage to precipitate the denouement. The libretto/dialogue, sarcastic and slangy ('you watch your lips now/just get a grip now'; 'Am I dreaming? am I hell?/It's a setback, not an ending') is matched by yuppie slapstick - poolside dunkings, petticoats singed on the barbecue - and high camp hi jinks, and acted to the hilt by this talented young company. If Cinderella has 'British class obsession' stamped all over it, Katharina Thalbach's Macbeth is a quintessential Berlin export: a Brechtian interpretation which turns Shakespearean tragedy on its head and makes of the bloody male world of Macbeth a feminist triumph. Malcolm Rutherford saluted this production when it briefly visited London this winter, and I add my voice to his. With its grim illustration that power corrupts, Macbeth has of course the perfect Brechtian plot. Thalbach despatches the soldier-monarch in just over two shrill and breathless hours during which Marcus Vollenklee triples in size from hen-pecked weakling to a bloated, parody of kinghood. Gone are the long speeches, the philosophising: this is a Macbeth action-packed as a cartoon strip, bright with caricature and expressionist display. Thus when Guntbert Warns plays Duncan as a pastiche of Bernard Minetti, the 86-year-old Berlin actor who had his debut with Max Reinhardt in the 1920s, Thalbach is making a theatrical joke which later turns into a neat political point: the same actor, as Macduff, discovers Duncan's corpse - friend and foe, survivor or victim, are equally ridiculous in the game of war and heroics. 'Fair is foul and foul is fair', the witches scrawl on a wall. They are recast here as a cross between The Threepenny Opera's Tart-without-a-heart Jenny and Brecht's streetwise pacifist Mother Courage. They dance, hang above the stage on ropes like seductive spiders, then pamper Macbeth as in a brothel. Their dance of death is at once a showpiece and the last word: 'We don't need a new master, we don't need one at all', they chant in an almost exact quotation from Brecht's die Rundkopfe und die Spitzkopfe. Thalbach is an entertainer with the technical imagination to channel her subversive message into a coherent masterpiece of staging. At the other extreme of Shakespearean innovation, Vienna has Romeo Castellucci's Amleto, which with a cast of one plus a chorus of stuffed toys offers a futuristic Hamlet set in a man-size circuit board of tangled wires and flashing lights. I cannot report on the language of the production because, between electric shocks and toy pistol shots, Paolo Tonti stutters like an autistic Christopher Robin through a text where not one word is fully uttered. His father's ghost is a teddy bear, Gertrude is a kangaroo and Ophelia a wind-up doll. This is not a Spitting Image joke but a two-hour performance deadly serious, mightily pleased with its own metaphors of non-communication, and achingly dull. Heiner Muller's Hamlet Machine did this sort of thing properly at last year's Berlin festival; can the Festwochen organisers really not distinguish between copycat gibberish and original vital reworkings? Two further redrawn classics are to come to Vienna in June: Bruno Moderna's composition Hyperion, after Holderlin, and Needcompany's Antony and Cleopatra. On this showing, they will be either brilliant or beastly. 'Cinderella' is sponsored by Mobil; the Festival continues until June 4

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Travel case will be heard in Egypt 
text:  HAMED EL CHIATY &amp; CO v THOMAS COOK GROUP LTD Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: May 5 1992 A WRITTEN contract expressed to be governed by a foreign law but silent as to jurisdiction, may be treated as rectified for the purposes of the action in any Division of the High Court on the application of the plaintiff or the defendant, if there was prior oral agreement between the parties that the foreign court should have exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes and they mistakenly believed that the express wording as to the governing law achieved that effect. Mr Justice Hirst so held when staying three actions by Hamed El Chiaty &amp; Co, trading as Travco Nile Cruise Lines (Travco), against Thomas Cook Group Ltd, on claims arising under agreements for charter of the Nile Rhapsody. HIS LORDSHIP said Travco was an Egyptian tourist company specialising in Nile cruises. Thomas Cook was an English travel company. Under a project originating towards the end of 1987, Thomas Cook was to help finance the construction of Nile Rhapsody by Travco, and then charter her from Travco for use on package tours. Thomas Cook guaranteed a stipulated minimum of passengers for each trip. Written contracts were drawn up. They provided that 'this agreement shall be governed by Egyptian law', but were silent as to jurisdiction. Thomas Cook's case, strongly denied by Travco, was that in 1988 it was agreed that the contracts would be subject to Egyptian law and to the exclusive jurisdiction of Egyptian courts. It said it could rely on the principle in El Amria (1981) 2 Lloyd's Rep 119 that the court would generally enforce such an agreement unless the plaintiffs could show a strong reason for not doing so. Its second line of attack was that it was entitled to a stay on the basis of forum non conveniens on the principles in Spiliada (1987) AC 460. The consequence of establishing the Egyptian jurisdiction agreement would be a shift in burden of proof in favour of Thomas Cook. Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2 1990. The ensuing crisis engulfed the tourist trade in Egypt and throughout the Middle East. Thomas Cook failed to fulfil its guarantees. On February 4 1991, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised people not to travel to Egypt without strong reason. On February 25, Thomas Cook purported to invoke force majeure, and that was re-iterated in March. On the evidence, the court found that in January 1988 the parties agreed orally that disputes should be subject exclusively to Egyptian law and Egyptian jurisdiction, and that they thought (wrongly) that the clause inserted in the contract had that effect. Snell's Equity 29th Edition 1990, page 626, having noted that rectification claims were assigned to the Chancery Division, stated that 'any Division may give effect to a defence of rectification as regards transactions without actually rectifying the instrument'. In Mostyn (1876) 1 CPD 145,150, the Court of Common Pleas held that if a defendant in that Division set up facts which in the Chancery Division would entitle him to have an instrument reformed or set aside, 'though this Division cannot reform or set it aside with regard to its effect in future it may, for the purpose of determining the action, treat it as set aside'. In Breslauer v Barwick (1876 36 LT 52), the same court applied Mostyn and treated a charterparty as if a mistake as to the plaintiff's identity were amended, since 'facts were shown as would cause the Chancery Division to reform it'. Both cases were of general application. The statement in Snell was accurate, subject only to the qualification that, having regard to Breslauer, a plaintiff as well as a defendant was entitled to invoke the power. As to whether the Chancery Division would have made a rectification order, there must be 'convincing proof' that there was a prior agreement, that it was still effective when the relevant instrument was executed, that by mistake the instrument failed to carry out that agreement, and that if rectified as claimed, the instrument would carry out the agreement (Snell 628-632; Joscelyne v Nissen (1970) 2 QB 86). There was convincing proof of all four aspects. In the exercise of its discretion, the court would treat the contracts as rectified, so that 'this agreement shall be governed by English law' read as 'this agreement shall be governed by Egyptian law and all disputes hereunder shall be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of Egyptian courts'. Thomas Cook was entitled to invoke the El Amria test. That was sufficient to dispose of the summonses in its favour. The Spiliada tests laid down by Lord Goff were that a stay would only be granted on the ground of forum non conveniens 'where the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for trial of the action, ie, in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice'. In applying the first test, the correct approach was to consider which country was the natural forum. On the second test, the key factor was whether the plaintiffs could establish that they would not obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction. As to the first test, the fact that a contract was governed by foreign law was highly material - not only because a foreign court was obviously best fitted to adjudicate on its own law, but also because it avoided the expense of bringing expert witnesses to the UK to debate foreign law issues. In the present case substantial points of legal principle were at stake. Egypt had a modern civil code system, modelled mainly on French law. Other sources of law included custom, Islamic law, natural law and equity. It was not a case in which English courts would be applying familiar principles. On nearly all the Egyptian law issues, there was almost total disagreement between the expert witnesses. Force majeure was a very important potential defence. The experts disagreed as to the relevant provisions of the Egyptian Civil Code. The legal questions were pre-eminently more suitable for decision in Egypt than in the UK. Thomas Cook understandably found it necessary to lead evidence from Egypt as to the general effect of the Kuwait crisis and Gulf War on tourism there. In relation to Egyptian law and to Egyptian evidence, the force majeure issue pointed very strongly in favour of Egypt. As to damages, there was dispute between the experts. One said damages would be assessed on a net loss of profit basis. The other said parties might fix damages in advance. So far as evidence was concerned, Thomas Cook would need to scrutinise Travco's accounts (partly in Arabic) and to call crew members of Travco's vessels and suppliers of services on the Nile. It followed that in relation to Egyptian law and evidence the damages issue pointed very strongly in favour of Egypt. The court was satisfied that the evidence as a whole pointed overwhelmingly in favour of Egypt as the natural forum, since the actions had their most real and substantial connection with Egypt. Egypt was another available forum with competent jurisdiction which was clearly and distinctly the appropriate forum for trial of the actions. Thomas Cook had satisfied the first Spiliada test. As to the second test, the burden was on Travco to show juridical disadvantage. It relied on delay, interest and costs. In respect of costs, which were not recoverable in Egypt, and to a small extent in respect of delay and interest, Travco would suffer juridical disadvantages if the action was stayed in England. That fell far short of establishing that Travco would be deprived of substantial justice if the UK actions were stayed and trial took place in Egypt. Justice did not require that a stay should not be granted. Travco failed under the second Spiliada test. The actions were stayed. For Thomas Cook: Charles Haddon-Cave (Field Fisher Waterhouse). For Travco: Jonathan Gaisman (Linklaters &amp; Paines).

The resignation of Bobroff, 40, who founded the group in the early 1970s, was 'mutually agreed' with the rest of the board. His departure marks a change in direction for the company, which is returning to its core business of property investment and development. In recent years, Bobroff had tried to diversify by taking a stake in Camford Engineering, a motor components company which has since been sold, and in Frogmore, a property investment company. However, the plan to create a diversified group was interrupted by the property recession and the retrenchment of the parent company, which underwent a debt restructuring. In a statement to the stock exchange, the company explained Bobroff's resignation as: 'In the present circumstances of the UK property market, there is restricted opportunity for someone whose main interests are in creating and executing corporate transactions.' Instead of appointing a new managing director, the board will report to Michael Rendle, the chairman, who is a former managing director of British Petroleum, and Richard Westcott, a non-executive director. ***** Peter Popper has been appointed md of the design and management service company of HIGGS AND HILL. ***** John Springate has been appointed md of MAUNSELL PB, jointly owned by Maunsell and Parsons Brinckerhoff International. Most recently a director of Kennedy Henderson,he was seconded to TML while with Balfour Beatty. ***** Richard Goatcher has been appointed director of specialised works at MANSELL; he moves from Mark Fitzpatrick. ***** James Gandy and Philip Pawley have been appointed to the board of GROSVENOR SQUARE PROPERTIES. ***** Young he may be, at 43, but Neil Johnson will bring a lot of long-term insight into the UK industrial scene when he takes up the post of ENGINEERING EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION director-general in July. The Cardiff and Sandhurst-educated Johnson has been witness to nearly 20 years of transformation in UK engineering, from what at times has been one of its most changeable and uncomfortable vantage points: Rover Group, nee British Leyland, nee BLMC, nee British Motor Corporation. After serving as a graduate trainee with Lex Service, Johnson joined BLMC in 1974. In the course of seven years, in a variety of capacities, he watched at close quarters as appalling labour relations, productivity and other problems took Britain's biggest car-maker to the brink; and as one of Sir Michael Edwardes' corporate strategists helped tentatively pull it back again. He acquired another perspective from helping to package Jaguar for privatisation after joining it as sales and marketing director in 1981. Post-Jaguar's privatisation, 'soldiering on' for Johnson assumed literal meaning - he took a three-year secondment to the Ministry of Defence, commanding the 4th Battalion, Royal Green Jackets, before returning to Rover as sales and service director for Land Rover Worldwide. Currently he is Rover Group's director of European Operations.

text:  Sharks generally get a pretty poor press, but it seems they do have some rather surprising uses. An international dermatologists' conference in Perth, Australia was told last week that shark bile, secreted by the liver to aid the digestion of fats, cuts down grease production and reduces acne significantly. David Fenton of St Thomas's Hospital, London, told the conference that in a study of 15 patients who applied shark bile extract spray on their faces twice a day, 14 had significantly improved or altogether cleared their acne problems within two months. Two months after treatment stopped, the spots returned. Known as isolutrol and marketed as Ketsugo, the solution has been patented by McFarlane Laboratories, a family-owned Melbourne drug company.

text:  In a healthy person the heart responds to exercise and sustained physical activity by accelerating the heartbeat and pumping more oxygen-carrying blood around the body. But in diseased or damaged hearts pacemakers do the work. Conventional pacemakers work with a piezoelectric (activity) sensor which speeds up heart rate in response to physical activity. But doctors have found a way to sustain higher heartbeat rates and improve workload capacity by adding a minute ventilation sensor. Medtronic's new Legend Plus pacemaker, which was implanted for the first time in a 60-year-old patient in Munich last month, stimulates a diseased or damaged heart to pump more blood in response to the body's varying needs for oxygen.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / The Property Market: UK giant profits from its cautious ways 
text:  Mr Peter Hunt, chairman of Land Securities, the UK's largest property company, sat in his splendid new offices overlooking Trafalgar Square in central London and gently scoffed at the critics who believe the company is too cautious. 'If we had geared up two years ago as the brokers said we should, we (he motioned to his fellow directors) would not be here.' The claim was something of an exaggeration at a time when his rivals have kept their jobs in spite of some hair-raising mistakes. But Mr Hunt can be forgiven for pressing the point. Land Securities has been a model of prudence - at a time when extravagant gestures were two-a-penny in the sector. The company's caution has been rewarded by the stock market, where its share price has significantly out-performed the rest of the sector. And the trend could well continue; a poll of investors by Gallup for Chartered Surveyor Weekly, a trade magazine, this week suggested that Land Securities would be the best performing property share of the year. Investors appreciate the liquidity of Land Securities' shares in addition to the company's stability and broad exposure to property. 'It's almost like an institution,' says Mr Marc Gilbard of County NatWest, the brokers. Few of Land Securities' stock market rivals offer such security of income. Three quarters of the company's rental income is underpinned by leases expiring beyond 2000, without break clauses and with upward only rent reviews. The company has not put a foot wrong in recent years and its stalwart, defensive qualities are exactly attuned to investors' needs at present. But for how much longer? Will its supporters abandon it in better times, as they have done in the rising markets of the past? Moreover, might the very qualities that have stood it in such good stead as an investment make it a target of criticism in the broader context of the economy as whole? The criticism of Land Securities is largely directed at its conservatism and bulk. Its tenants, struggling in the teeth of recession, could be forgiven for viewing the company as a rent-collecting machine, which reaps its profits from the structure of a UK property market which heavily favours landlords. Land Securities' rents - among the highest in the world - are protected by lengthy leases, upward only reviews and the right to claim rent from an original tenant if it assigned a lease to a company that subsequently defaulted. At a time when these contracts are driving businesses into receivership, large landlords such as Land Securities are sometimes seen as burdens on business rather than providers of an essential service. The company's apparently effortless ability to generate higher profits has long provoked envy as well as admiration. 'Landsits: How to stay in bed and make Pounds 10m' thundered a newspaper headline in 1980. The same reaction has often been provoked by Land Securities' ability to increase the value of its portfolio (with two notable exceptions: in the property crash of the early 1970s, the value of its portfolio crashed by 38 per cent; and the 32 per cent decline over the past two years). In the 1980s, a newspaper complained: 'There is something almost indecent about a company which sees its value increase by more than Pounds 1bn in a single year with barely a sign of sweat on its management's brow.' A common charge against Land Securities is that after it had built itself up through an audacious programme of borrowing and takeovers, it then simply sat on the best sites in London. This emphasis on acquiring the best positions in London was reflected in the enduring motto of the company's founder, Lord Samuel: 'Location, location, location.' The company's natural caution was reflected in its reluctance to pioneer new markets in the Docklands. This bewildered more adventurous developers, including Olympia &amp; York, which thought that London's established landlords were responsible for the capital's outdated and expensive office stock. Land Securities' policy of shunning new locations such as the Docklands could have been risky. During the heady days of the late 1980s, it seemed as though the primacy of location (ie, the City) would be replaced by the need for the most up-to-date product (as provided by the Docklands) as the most important priority for tenants. In the event, following the difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, Land Securities' reserve in venturing into the Docklands seems vindicated. Criticism of the company's conservatism does not rankle with Land Securities. The company remains unabashed about its lack of enthusiasm for pioneering offices in east London. Mr Hunt believes that London will go on developing in a westerly direction. He describes the government's promotion of the Docklands and its lackadaisical attitude to transport planning as 'extraordinary'. The government's decision, late in the day, to give priority to east London's infrastructure over central London is 'monstrous', says Mr Hunt. 'The taxpayers working in the centre deserve to have central London tubes and railways built with their money before that thing in east London,' he says. Land Securities can also shrug off the idea that it has an outdated portfolio. During the 1980s, it spent hundreds of millions on revitalising its portfolio. The task of updating its Pounds 4.3bn of property is an endless one and the process will continue, although the slump in the market has forced Land Securities to mothball its planned redevelopment of buildings such as Stag Place in Victoria. Even its concentration on central London offices - which are still set to under-perform - is less overwhelming than previously. Retail and industrial property now account for more than half the portfolio's value, the result of a conscious shift in strategy as well as the slump in office values. Land Securities now likes to describe itself as the biggest retail investor on the market. Yet some property experts think it is just too large to be nimble. 'It is like a crude oil tanker,' says one. 'If it wants to change direction by five degrees, it takes 20 miles to do it.' This is a long-standing criticism. Back in 1979, Mr Joseph Sebag, then one of the UK's top property brokers, issued a call for the company to be broken up. 'We believe that the group is now just too large to manage dynamically and consider the management's philosophy is to put safety before entrepreneurial gain,' he said. The young Turks of the 1980s property expansion agreed and repeatedly ran their slide rules over Land Securities. They reckoned they could secure greater returns by borrowing and working the companies' assets harder, although in the end, the company was always too big to be threatened. The charge that Land Securities is an under-geared monolith that is insufficiently exploiting depressed market conditions may gather force when the market recovers. Rivals which are more highly geared will see the steepest increases in their assets, a key measure of a property company's success. But Land Securities remains unmoved. Although it has looked at the possibility of corporate acquisitions it considers that none have sufficient quality. It would prefer to cherry pick individual properties, while keeping a stern eye on its own gearing, now at 43 per cent. 'We are not going to buy because brokers say we should,' says Mr Hunt. 'In a valuation based business you have to be very careful with gearing.' The more the company borrows, the greater impact falling property prices will have on its net asset value. Not all analysts think that Land Securities's asset values will take another battering this year. Mr David Tunstall, a property analyst with Smith New Court, a securities company, says an improvement in retail values could push the company's net asset value up from 555p to 570p this year. Most analysts have pencilled in another fall, some to as little as 500p over the next two years. There is also reason to be cautious about future profits. The large rent increases which were in the pipeline two years ago have virtually disappeared in the worst-hit parts of the market. But Land Securities has no reason to be on the defensive. It has made none of the mistakes of its smaller rivals. And if inflation and the rewards of heavy borrowing are things of the past, its cautious style may stay in fashion.

KPMG Peat Marwick, the management consultants, found that 75 per cent of companies had introduced performance-related pay and predicted that this would increase to more than 90 per cent in the next two years. Performance-related pay has grown rapidly in the private sector over the past decade for white-collar and professional workers. KPMG said financial services companies with established schemes regarded them as 'highly successful' and were planning embellishments, for example group bonuses for sales staff. Performance pay is the norm in building societies, while some of the bigger insurance companies have introduced such schemes and banks are following. The large mutual life companies have been the slowest to introduce performance pay schemes.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Building workers skirmish over pay: Strike organisers tell Diane Summers why they believe the employers are vulnerable 
text:  MIKE, CHRIS and Frank are sitting in a cafe after a hot day's work on a central London building site. They would prefer to be quenching their thirst in the pub next door, but have been asked to leave for wearing 'work clothes' - the euphemism employed by landlords to protect white-collar drinkers from the sight of the working man. The pub is not the only place Mike, Chris and Frank are unwelcome to the management. They are part of a team which has been organising unofficial strike action and flying pickets on nine London building sites over the past few weeks. So far there have been only skirmishes, but the core group of 40 to 50 activists known as the Joint Sites Committee are threatening full-scale battle with building contractors across the capital before the end of the summer - Frank claims that even the new headquarters site for MI5 at Vauxhall and MI6's site at Millbank have been penetrated. Links are being forged with workers on sites in other parts of the UK, and builders claim unofficial support from London Underground employees and postal workers. Money to support strikers is raised at meetings, union conferences and in canteens on building sites across London. The issue is money - building workers have taken pay cuts of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent over the past two years. Sometimes there is no pay as subcontractors hit by the recession disappear and cheques bounce. Longer working hours and deteriorating health-and-safety standards are also sources of complaint. Mike says there is deep anger among building workers: 'They can't pay the rent - they've got nothing to lose by taking action. When there's a confrontation with the employer, instead of walking away, they're standing their ground. Anyway, they can't walk away, there are no other jobs.' Now is a good time to strike, says Chris: 'The employers are weak. They've cut their own profit margins even before the foundations are laid. They're terrified of penalty clauses for not completing on time.' Two years ago a bricklayer was getting between Pounds 75 and Pounds 80 a day. Now jobs are being advertised at Pounds 48, says Frank. Rates for labourers have dropped from around Pounds 40 to Pounds 60 a day to Pounds 35 a day, Chris says. The worst off might be left with Pounds 23 after tax, he adds, for working from 8am to 6.15pm. The figures are confirmed by research carried out by Ucatt, the main building union, in support of this year's pay claim. Ucatt says building workers have been doubly hit by the housing crisis. Many became first-time buyers of properties they were building in the boom 1980s. Mortgaged up to their necks, they have now seen earnings plummet. For Mike, Chris and Frank, the official pay talks are an irrelevance. Like 700,000 other building workers out of a total 1.3m, they are self-employed and sceptical of the effectiveness of union representatives. Says Frank: 'A lot of the officials are only interested in their flash cars and cushy jobs.' But Mike says some union officials have backed them, though this has to be 'with a nod and a wink' because much of the action is illegal secondary picketing and wildcat strikes without the balloting required by law. Some of the activists are union members - mainly Ucatt, with a few TGWU general union members. Others - like a large proportion of the workers taking action - belong to no union. BUILDING employers yes-terday proposed a freeze on basic pay rates in talks covering 600,000 building and civil engineering workers. The proposal was rejected by the unions and further talks are due to be held on June 9. The Building Employers Confederation and the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors said the industry was 'still stuck at the bottom of the longest recession the economy has suffered since the 1930s'.

text:  NEARLY half of Britain's registered charities submitted accounts to the Charity Commission last year in response to its drive to improve administration of the sector. The commission said yesterday that 46 per cent of registered charities submitted accounts last year compared with only 11 per cent in 1989. Under the new Charities Act, financial controls will be strengthened and the commission believes a target of obtaining accounts from 80 per cent to 90 per cent of charities can be achieved by 1994. The commission said in its annual report that at the end of last year there were 166,503 charities on its database, and that 1,168 inactive organisations were removed from it. The number of new charities registering last year was 4,042. The commission concluded 397 inquiries into charities last year as a result of public complaints and its own monitoring, and irregularities were discovered in 129 cases. Maladministration was the most common problem, covering 40 per cent of cases. But 10 per cent involved fund-raising abuse and 3 per cent involved charities engaging in political activities. The new changes in the law will add to the responsibilities of charity trustees. The report says the commissioners have decided that there is no objection to trustees being insured for personal liability at their charity's expense for acts 'either properly undertaken or undertaken in breach of trust but under an honest mistake'. The report says the commissioners were asked by the Law Society whether it would be appropriate for solicitors employed by charities to draft wills of prospective benefactors. The commissioners say drafting of wills is unlikely to be a proper activity. 1991 Report of the Charity Commissioners. HMSO. Pounds 8.75

text:  TALKS are due to begin on Sunday in the Nigerian capital Abuja between the Sudanese government and southern rebels who have been fighting a particularly bloody civil war since May 1983. The talks are being organised by Nigeria, which is current chairman of the Organisation of African Unity and was given a mandate by the organisation last year to bring the two sides together. The Sudanese government delegation is due to meet Mr Lam Akol, who is one of the leaders of the Nasir faction that has recently broken away from the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. Whether the SPLA leader, the dictatorial Mr John Garang, will himself be present is not yet clear. On previous occasions in the last two years, when the two sides established contact in Nairobi and Addis Ababa, Mr Garang was known to be in town but would not meet the other side. What might give hope for the present talks is that both sides have good reasons for bringing the war to an end. In the latest dry season of November to May the northern army has captured a number of important southern towns. The SPLA was also weakened by the collapse in Ethiopia last year of the hardline communist regime of Colonel Mengistu, who had been its main outside backer. On the northerners' side the main reasons for wanting peace now are economic. Military spending has been consuming a large part of the government's budget and a lack of progress towards peace in recent years has been a main reason why Sudan has not received development aid from western countries. The army also has suffered heavy casualties in recent fighting. A military hospital area near Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, has been closed to civilians so that they cannot see the large numbers who have been coming back from the south badly wounded. Before the recent campaign began there were mutinies in some of the northern army garrisons. But if the military and economic logic point to peace, the political signs are less encouraging. The reasons go back to the breakdown of the Addis Ababa agreement, which ended the earlier civil war of 1955 to 1972. The agreement established a federal system of government which gave the south autonomy and recognised its distinct cultural identity. But later the central government began amending the boundaries of the south so that it could transfer to the north a small oil discovery in the Upper Nile province, some uranium deposits and the fertile Renk area bordering the White Nile. Then there were attempts to introduce the north's Arab and Islamic culture into the south. If there is to be an agreement at Abuja one possibility is that the southerners will have to accept that, even if they get regional autonomy they will be disadvantaged second-class citizens in an Islamic state, excluded from any important jobs in the north, which has 20m out of Sudan's total population of 26m. Alternatively the northern regime, if it is not prepared to weaken its commitment to Islamic law Arabism, might think of allowing the south complete independence. This is now discussed quite widely in Khartoum, where it is suggested that some members of the government might like to be rid of their Christian and pagan minority, but officials of the regime reject the idea.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Nightmare in Bombay for bank chief 
text:  MR Malcolm Williamson's worst nightmare has come true. Since late 1989 when he joined Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, he has been trying to convince shareholders and rival banks that Standard's accident-prone days were over. However, late on Wednesday Mr Williamson, now managing director, disclosed that the bank was making a Pounds 50m provision to cover possible losses on an arcane form of securities business carried out by the bank's branch in Bombay. Indeed, yesterday he admitted that the Pounds 50m estimated loss was an arbitrary figure. The loss should not be 'more than Pounds 100m' and it 'could be less' than the Pounds 50m. Such uncertainty will not reassure the bank's shareholders, but it is understandable. Mr Williamson got wind of the problem only last Wednesday, when he was entertaining government officials in Brunei. 'When I was told, my initial reaction was shock, disbelief, lack of comprehension,' he said. The source of the problem was a form of securities business unknown to him. Indeed, it appears that no one in Standard's City of London head office was aware the bank was involved in this business. He then thought about flying to Bombay immediately, but could not get a visa in Brunei or in Manila, his next stop. So in the event Mr David Brougham, the bank's treasurer, and Mr Erick Naslund, its chief firefighter, were flown out with more than a dozen other executives to investigate. What they found was 'trunk-loads of paper', Mr Williamson said. 'Sorting it all out could take months'. These banker's receipts are a form of IOU issued by banks in India. Settlement of Bombay stock exchange transactions is a lengthy and convoluted process. In order to create a more liquid market, banks issued IOUs to each other, which were promises to deliver shares or stock at some distant date. The recipient of such an IOU was not supposed to transfer it to any other institution. But Mr Williamson said that a market developed in the paper. 'It became a form of currency.' The amount of paper circulating then exploded from the beginning of the year, as Bombay share prices began to soar. The only check on the integrity of the market was a monthly attempt by the Reserve Bank of India to verify whether there was a balance between banks claiming to be owed stock by virtue of the receipts they held, and those banks recognising a liability to deliver stock. 'At the end of last month, the Reserve Bank noticed there was a massive imbalance', said Mr Williamson. 'All the banks then started to assess their positions'. What Standard Chartered found was shocking. It has an exposure to Pounds 100m of transactions where it cannot be certain of receiving payment. Mr Williamson said there were three possible explanations for this discrepancy: It may be holding forged IOUs. The counterparty named in an IOU may not have the financial capacity to complete the transaction. It may have received a claim from another bank and not have the securities claimed. Not all the Pounds 100m is likely to be lost. Over coming months Standard should be able to make some further recoveries. However, it does not know whether other banks are holding further IOUs making claims on it.

text:  JIANG ZEMIN, the Chinese Communist party leader, has staked his position firmly in the pro-reform camp with a glowing tribute to capitalism, Reuter reports from Beijing. In comments to graduates, carried on the front pages of all leading newspapers yesterday, Jiang said the main goal of China's economic reform was to learn from capitalist nations. Western diplomats said it was clear Jiang had thrown in his lot with senior leader Deng Xiaoping's reform drive. 'The main goal and contents of China's reform and opening policy is to learn all the good and advanced things from overseas, including from capitalist countries, to speed up economic development,' Jiang was quoted as saying. Learning from capitalist countries has been a theme of Deng's campaign to speed up the pace of market-oriented change. It has been fiercely resisted by ideologues who see it as a betrayal of socialist principles. Diplomats said Jiang, along with Prime Minister Li Peng, lacked an independent political base, and moved with prevailing winds. Consequently, their statements were a good indication of the balance of power in China. Sweden's Defence Research Establishment (FOA) said yesterday it had monitored what it believed was the most powerful Chinese nuclear test explosion since 1976, Reuter adds from Stockholm.

text:  'NIGERIA is in the grip of a revolutionary pressure,' warned African Concorde, one of the country's leading weekly news magazines, in mid-April. An irate government confiscated the strongly critical issue and closed the magazine for two weeks, but the warning is proving prophetic. Nearly seven years after seizing office in a bloodless coup, President Ibrahim Babangida faces a crisis that threatens next January's scheduled handover to civilian rule, and imperils the stability of Africa's most populous state. At least 250 people are reported to have been killed in clashes in Kaduna state, angry youths have rioted in Lagos, the biggest city, while trouble yesterday broke out near Abuja, the new federal capital, and in Lagos, the largest city. Police used tear gas to break up ethnic fighting in a Lagos market. The violence, often described as 'religious and ethnic riots', is undoubtedly caused in part by rivalries in a country divided between a largely Moslem north and mainly Christian south, and with three leading ethnic groups. But the violence is also a symptom of a different malaise. The military government is fighting for its life, undermined by economic mismanagement and endemic corruption, and under attack for human rights abuses. Living standards have fallen drastically in the 12 years since Nigeria's oil boom ended. The roots of the crisis can be traced back many years, but what may prove to have been the turning point for the Babangida government came last March. A big devaluation of the naira (from 10.5 naira to Dollars 1 down to 18 naira) was a last-ditch attempt to shore up a faltering structural adjustment programme, and meet one of the main conditions for the renewal of a lapsed standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The result was all pain and no gain. Prices soared, and inflation is set to reach 50 per cent later this year. The IMF negotiations that followed failed to clear other hurdles including the size of the budget deficit. Meanwhile the IMF deadlock holds up urgently needed rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 30bn external debt. A series of other developments further eroded the government's standing. A confidential World Bank report which reached the press was highly critical of the lack of accountability in government spending - a polite way of referring to corruption. Nigerians and foreign partners alike have been dismayed by the government's profligate spending on Abuja, continued funding of an uneconomic Dollars 5bn steel project, and a Dollars 1.4bn aluminium project of arguable merit. For all the promises of probity, the military elite is as corrupt as any regime that preceded it, taking kickbacks on contracts and diverting government funds. But for sheer audacity, the government's unrepentant admission that it had provided middle-ranking army officers with private cars on nominal repayment terms took some beating. For infuriated Nigerians, with per capita income down by two-thirds over the past decade, it was the act of a cynical self-serving regime. If the return to civilian rule had whole-hearted support, there would be a safety valve for the current tensions. But many Nigerians are resentful that the government insists that only two political parties will be allowed, their rule-books written by civil servants and indistinguishable the one from the other. If the violence continues, however, even this unsatisfactory path to democracy may be closed - if not by Gen Babangida, then by his successor from the barracks.

text:  IT NEVER ceases to amaze that a single sentence can spawn a million words. Vice-President Dan Quayle's comment in California on Tuesday about a fictional television character could yet break all records. It could also make or break a few political reputations. The furore surrounding his assault on the lifestyle of Murphy Brown - a forty-something white, wealthy career woman who chooses to have a baby out of wedlock - might be dismissed as just another example of the prevalent confusion between fact and fiction, but for its immediate political impact. It has demonstrated, above all, how concerned President George Bush's re-election campaign is about shoring up his political base among Republican conservatives, previously attracted to Mr Pat Buchanan but now under threat from the prospective independent candidacy of Mr Ross Perot. The clear strategy is for Mr Quayle, popular with such conservatives, to secure this heartland, while Mr Bush plays a more aloof role. The vice-president will be allowed to attack the media and all its creations, real and imagined. Mr William Barr, the attorney-general, has been designated a key supporting actor in the upholding of law and social order. The conservative message is that the collapse of traditional family values is the real dagger pointing at America's heart and a key factor behind the Los Angeles riots. 'It doesn't help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown - a character who supposedly epitomises today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman - mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another lifestyle choice,' Mr Quayle said on Tuesday. In the city ghettoes of the US, it is a fact that well over half of black children are born out of wedlock, well over half of all families are headed by single women, and well over half of all families live below the poverty line. But the relevance of their plight to the Murphy Brown character, a television anchorwoman played by actress Candice Bergen, is distant. One survey puts the programme, although the third most popular nationally, 55th among black TV audiences. As for the election strategy obligation for Mr Bush to play a kinder, gentler role, events after Mr Quayle spoke laid bare one of the president's great weaknesses: his frequent inability, especially when impromptu, to articulate with any clarity what he does believe in. Mr Bush seemed embarrassed, almost hapless, in the face of a barrage of reporters' questions on the issue. Abortion, which the president now opposes, is at the heart of the row. It could be an Achilles heel for him this year. Only this week, Mr Bush announced that a new human tissue bank would not be allowed to use tissue from aborted foetuses. Yet an ambivalence, an apparent desire to have it both ways, remains. This leaves the president politically vulnerable to the more confident assertions of his opponents and even of his supporters. Mr Quayle does at least state what he thinks, with confidence, which is why some pundits have taken to referring to him as the stronger part of the Republican presidential ticket this year.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: Europe aims to sweep path to Uruguay Round - One thorny problem may have been removed in the world trade talks, but plenty more are waiting to take its place 
text:  MRS CARLA HILLS, US trade representative, was in no doubt two weeks ago about the state of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. 'The problem is agriculture: that is the problem that has to be swept away - and the Europeans have the broom. We have to wait until they have a consensus as to how they are going to treat with it.' Today it seems the EC has delivered at least the consensus she needs. Whether the package of CAP reforms provides an adequate broom for the agriculture problem to be swept away has yet to be made clear. Much will depend on meetings in Washington next week between US and EC negotiators. Even if the point has indeed been reached where the agriculture problem can be swept away, a new and unhappy reality may then be brought back into focus: the dispute between the US and the EC is but one of the obstacles blocking a Uruguay Round agreement. If this were now to be cleared away, problems over market access agreements, and trade in services could yet bring the agreement to grief. Disagreement over farm trade reforms have blocked progress towards a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round since the Brussels summit at the end of 1990. Crisis was triggered there not by the US, but by Argentina, which led a walk-out of farm exporters from the developing world in protest at EC farm trade policies. They were angered not just because Europe remains largely closed to their exports, but because the EC practice of dumping subsidised farm products on to world markets had ruined food prices, undermining their main source of export earnings. For the past 18 months, all attempts to seal a Uruguay Round agreement have foundered on EC resistance to farm reform. Hopes that had been revived in December by publication of a draft agreement were quickly dashed in January by EC rejection of its proposals for liberalisation of farm trade. Most intractable were demands for a 20 per cent cut in domestic farm price supports; for a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised exports, and a 36 per cent cut in their value; and for compensation payments to farmers to be made in a form that did not encourage higher production. In addition, the EC was demanding that the US cut its sales to Europe of cheap grain substitutes, and that it agree a 'peace clause' preventing US companies from using US courts to enforce demands linked with any part of the farm trade agreement. As far as farm price supports are concerned, Mr Ray MacSharry's proposals appear to provide an important breakthrough: at 29 per cent, the cuts will be deeper, and will be made earlier, than the draft Uruguay Round agreement had demanded. Whether this augurs well for the unresolved issue of export subsidies is unclear. It is nevertheless worth recalling that a senior US trade negotiator said just two weeks ago: 'Whether it is export subsidies or rebalancing or internal supports, it comes down to the price of grain.' In Geneva yesterday, where Uruguay Round negotiators have faced mounting frustration in recent months over the lack of headway, the proposed CAP reforms received a cautious welcome. Officials from the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting countries said they were cautiously optimistic that the deal would inject 'fresh spirit' into the talks. But they needed to see how the projected reform would translate into changes in the EC's bargaining position over farm trade, and how it would affect products other than cereals, such as dairy and sugar. Cairns officials said the broad thrust of the reform appeared to be on the right lines. As long as the rest of the package broadly followed the agreement on cereals, it provided an assurance that the EC would make sizeable cuts in farm subsidies, including export subsidies, and curb over-production. Officials added that yesterday's agreement meant that, for the first time, the EC would be speaking with one voice on farm trade reform. Set against the advantage for US negotiators that an EC position will at last be clear when they meet in Washington next week is the disadvantage that the EC now has very little negotiating flexibility. Having sweated blood to wring this package of compromises out of EC member states, Mr MacSharry has little scope to win further compromises. If the package falls short of US and Cairns group demands, then further concessions will almost certainly have to come from them rather than the EC. A Uruguay Round farm trade breakthrough would immediately put Japan, Korea and Canada into the hot seat. All three are under fierce pressure to open their markets to farm products. All have been 'hiding' behind the US-EC conflict in recent months. For the Japanese government, concessions will be impossible until upper house elections late in July. For Korea, embarrassment is even more acute. The government faces elections at the end of this year, and could suffer gravely in important farm communities if it opens its market to rice imports before then. Canada's prime minister, Mr Brian Mulroney, has the unhappy position of being the least popular democratically elected leader in the world. He has just 15 per cent endorsement from voters in recent polls. With elections in 1993, concessions on opening up Canada's dairy market may cost him still more votes. 'It is unquestionably a time of reckoning,' said one EC observer.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         WORLD WHEAT PRODUCTION                            (million tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    1986      1987     1988     1989     1990#    1991+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                 72.1      71.5     74.6     79.2     80.4     84.8 US                 56.9      57.4     49.3     55.4     74.5     53.9 World             537.6     514.6    506.1    545.8    598.9    543.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #Estimated  +Forecast  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           WORLD WHEAT TRADE                            (million tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    86/87     87/88    88/89    89/90    90/91    91/92+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                  15.3      14.7     20.0     19.7     18.3     21.2 US                  28.2      43.2     37.8     33.5     28.3     34.0 World               90.3     105.7     96.4     96.7     91.7    103.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- +Forecast  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           WORLD WHEAT STOCKS                        Estimated total carryover                            (million tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1986      1987     1988     1989     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main exporters      84.9      83.6     60.3     39.7     38.7     53.5 Others              75.2      83.3     82.3     75.2     81.3     87.9 World              160.0     167.2    142.6    114.9    120.0    141.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FAO  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          OECD BEEF PRODUCTION                           (thousand tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1987      1988     1989     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                 8,020     7,617    7,360    7,539    7,646 US                10,805    10,860   10,636   10,464   10,557 OECD              23,534    23,372   22,335   22,466   22,713  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         OECD BEEF CONSUMPTION                           (thousand tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1987      1988     1989     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                 7,500     7,620    7,400    7,000    7,200 US                11,628    11,613   11,196   11,048   11,098 OECD              22,861    23,091   22,010   21,509   21,793  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           OECD BEEF SURPLUS                           (thousand tonnes)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1987      1988     1989     1990     1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                   520        -3      -40      539      446 US                  -823      -753     -560     -584     -541 OECD                 674       281      325      958      920  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: French rural workforce holds the key 
text:  FRANCE, by far the largest farm power in the European Community, holds the key to the reform of the CAP. The process will not be easy for its diminishing, but vocal, farm population. As elsewhere in Europe, the economic importance of agriculture has weakened in France over the past decade, yet the country remains the EC's largest producer of maize (about half the total), wheat, beef and fine wine. It grows twice as much cereal as it eats and has more farmland than Spain. The political influence of traditionally right-wing farmers' unions has also declined. Yet the farmers' organisations, led by the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (FNSEA), still have the capacity to wreak mayhem. Only last autumn, 150,000 farmers descended on Paris to protest against CAP reforms, in response to which the government promptly dished out FFr1.27bn (Pounds 120m) in emergency support. However, Mr Louis Mermaz, agriculture minister, and French farming unions have always seen eye to eye on one point: that incomes must be at least mainly linked to prices, rather than derive from social handouts. In reality, social subsidies are gaining fast. Some kinds of farming, notably beef and sheep, have already become so poor that various EC subsidies represent more than half of farmers' income. In that respect, the deal taking shape in Brussels can be presented to French farmers as a reasonable compromise. France, formerly one of the staunchest defenders of EC agriculture policy, signalled its willingness to compromise on reform last October, just a week after Germany, another former CAP conservative, gave its support for the European Commission's plans. This turning point in French agriculture policy reflected a growing realisation by farming leaders that some kind of social help was needed to enable an ageing farming population with few successors to retire peacefully. Every year, 30,000 farms close and only 10,000 new farmers start business, according to the FNSEA. The decline of France's rural workforce is sadly evident to any visitor to near-deserted villages in the rural centre and south. Over the past 20 years, farmers have fallen from just over 13 per cent of France's total workforce to 6 per cent. This did nothing to help the surplus, since productivity rose by an average of 1 per cent per year over the same period, and volumes of some cereal crops even rose. The surplus was shipped partly to EC neighbours, and also to the third world and the Soviet Union. As more farmers have gone out of business, more farms have merged, so that the average size of a holding rose from 19 hectares in 1970 to 28 hectares by 1988, making France the EC's fourth most intensive farming country. On the surface, this makes it a prime candidate for the EC proposals that all but the smallest farmers should take 15 per cent of their land out of production. However, the biggest farms are concentrated on the fertile basin plains north of the river Loire. The deal appears to offer less help for the smaller farmers, producing wine, fruit and vegetables, in the poorer rural depths of southern France.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Convertible zloty gives Poland's exports zip - Sharp rise in trade is most tangible sign of reform 
text:  POLAND HAS reacted with alacrity to the restoration of internal zloty convertibility and the throwing open of foreign trade to private entrepreneurs. A sharp increase in foreign trade has been one of the most tangible signs of economic change throughout the first 30 months of the country's reform programme. Imports as a percentage of gross domestic product, for example, have risen from 13.6 per cent in 1989 to 22.8 per cent last year while exports almost doubled from 9.2 per cent of GDP in the last year of the old regime to 15.3 per cent. The government is now banking on a further increase in exports this year to help break the back of a domestic recession which has seen industrial production in the state sector drop by more than 40 per cent. The fragile coalition government which emerged after elections last October signalled its intention to make exports more competitive by dropping the former policy of maintaining an overvalued zloty as an 'anchor' against inflation and a means of opening monopolistic domestic producers to the chill winds of competition. The shift began with a 17 per cent devaluation last May coupled with the introduction of a crawling peg system which allowed the currency to devalue by 1.8 per cent a month in the autumn. This was followed by a 12 per cent devaluation in February this year. As a result exports rose 5.7 per cent to Dollars 4.3bn between January and April while imports dropped 15 per cent to 3.7bn in the same period. This has turned a Dollars 269m trade deficit over the first four months of 1991 into a surplus of Dollars 612m this year, over four times the Dollars 153m surplus registered over 1991 as a whole. The speedy response to market signals is largely a reflection of the pace with which private entrepreneurs moved into an arena which used to be the preserve of lumbering state-controlled foreign trade companies. Private traders handled more than half last year's imports and 20 per cent of exports. At the same time trade shifted radically away from the former Soviet trading bloc Comecon area. Three years ago over a third of Polish trade was with the Comecon countries. Last year this had shrunk to a mere 17 per cent while the share of trade with European Community markets has soared from from 32 to 55 per cent. In a few cases however the shift to dollar payments for trade formerly conducted in the now defunct 'transferable' rouble has in fact increased trade. While neighbouring Czechoslovakia paid roubles for coal it stayed at the back of the queue despite the fact that the Polish mines were only a few kilometres away from the consuming Czech power stations and steel plants. Now the Czechs pay in dollars, however, sales from Poland's Silesian coal mines have risen from 1.4m tonnes in 1989 to 830,000 tonnes already in the first four months this year. Meanwhile Poland's ever-closer trading links with the European Community have caused a fog of confusion to descend on the details of the country's trade. To blame is the Single Administrative Document introduced by Polish customs in January and modelled on documents in use throughout the EC and the European Free Trade Association. Form-filling errors on a massive scale have led the statistical office to withhold foreign trade data until all the returns can be checked. The statistics are expected to reveal however that imports of consumer goods from the EC have dropped sharply this year. The lower zloty has increased the incentive for Polish entrepreneurs to produce such items domestically on sophisticated imported machines. The weaker zloty has also increased the competitiveness of exports such as steel products, already up 43 per cent last year. The risk here is that further Polish export penetration could trigger safeguard clauses and reverse the free-trade promises held out by last year's association agreement between the EC and the three central European countries-Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The survival of Poland's steel industry is becoming more and more dependent on exports which accounted for a quarter of the 9.8m tonnes of rolled steel produced in 1990 rising to 38 per cent of last year's lower output of 8.1m tonnes. Textiles and above all agricultural products are the other sensitive area with the EC but the present association agreement, with its commitment to a dismantling of barriers to trade in industrial goods by the end of the century, leaves most of the farming questions to further talks next year. But, according to Mr Witold Pereta, the head of Animex, a privatised meat and animal trader, Brussels need not worry as Poland's ailing agriculture may not even be able to supply the permitted quotas. 'In 1993 Poland will be permitted to sell 7,200 tonnes of mutton into the EC. But with the drop in our sheep population I think we'll have problems in finding that amount,' he says. Production costs at home are also so high that Animex is no longer exporting its Krakus brand ham to the US but is producing it under licence near Philadelphia in a company a quarter owned by the Polish group. Meanwhile, signature of the EC association agreement has made Prague, Warsaw and Budapest realise that trade barriers among themselves could soon be higher than with the Community. Accordingly talks are in train to liberalise trade within the triangle and bring it in line with the EC agreement. Such developments however are making the Americans uneasy at the prospect of facing new barriers in central Europe. The US has already protested against tariffs introduced last year to dampen rising imports and protect foreign currency reserves. American exporters argue that they are being discriminated against in favour of the EC. But Germany, Poland's main supplier and market, is only a few hours truck ride away for Polish traders and Poland's economic integration with the EC is expected to deepen by the year. This is in spite of the enormous political importance attached to attracting investment from and trade with the US and a long-term belief that Poland will also be well-placed to benefit from the eventual economic regeneration of the former Soviet Union.

text:  GREECE'S Public Power Corporation (PPC) has awarded a Dr19.6bn (Pounds 56m) contract to Babcock Energy Systems, the British engineering company, to upgrade a power station at Lavrion, near Athens, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The PPC intends to help reduce atmospheric pollution in Athens by developing generating capacity outside the city and converting diesel-fired units to natural gas during the 1990s. Babcock was the lowest bidder, ahead of Ansaldo of Italy and Asea Brown Boveri, the PPC said. The project involves transferring a steam turbine from the Keratsini power station in Athens to Lavrion, 40 miles from the capital. The turbine will be linked to two existing gas turbines to form a combined cycle unit, raising the plant's capacity from 114 to 180 MW. The project is due for completion in 1994. The Keratsini unit, formerly Athens' main power station, is closed for much of the year because of pollutants from its diesel-fired generators. The PPC plans to convert Keratsini to use Russian natural gas in the mid-1990s.

text:  A GROUP of visiting British executives yesterday called on the Japanese government to ensure that foreign companies have the same access in the country as Japanese companies have in the UK market. The six-company group, headed by the Duke of Kent and Mr Michael Perry, the chairman of Unilever, and including executives from Glaxo Holdings and SG Warburg &amp; Co, presented a list of proposals to Japanese industry representatives and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). In an 'Agenda for Action by Japanese Business', the executives expressed their confidence that British companies will expand Japanese market share 'unless that market is distorted for political reasons or because of excessive bias towards Japanese domestic suppliers'. However, Mr Perry said the delegation, in Tokyo as part of the Priority Japan campaign, does not regard Japan as a 'problem' but as an 'opportunity' and that British industry does not 'want to argue about the rules of the game'. UK exports to Japan had grown from Pounds 1.49bn to Pounds 2.63bn from 1987 to 1990, but the slowing of the Japanese economy and a resultant fall in demand for luxury goods and industrial machinery led to a decline to Pounds 2.26bn last year. For 1991, Japan's exports to the UK were Pounds 6.75bn, down from Pounds 6.76bn. The text of the Agenda for Action reflected UK concerns that Japanese equipment purchases, including aero-engines, satellites and semiconductor technology, could be influenced by the political pressure applied by Washington.

text:  NATO countries have agreed in principle that the alliance would be prepared to take on a peacekeeping role in Europe beyond the borders of its member nations, Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said yesterday. Mr Woerner, said details had still to be worked out but Nato foreign ministers are expected to give their blessing to the plan at a meeting in Oslo in two weeks. Until now, Nato's military structure and forces have been limited to the defence of member nations, although there is no suggestion the alliance should get involved in Gulf War-style military intervention. The decision could mean alliance troops might one day be deployed in peacekeeping missions, which until now has been the sole preserve of the UN, in places such as Bosnia or Nagorno-Karabakh. 'This is strictly for peacekeeping, not for warfighting,' said one alliance diplomat. According to the idea, backed by the US, Nato could put its military infrastructure, supplies or even troops at the disposal of the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) for peacekeeping missions. The fighting in Yugoslavia, Nagorno-Karabakh and the threat of new conflicts breaking out in an increasingly fragmented post-Cold War Europe have given impetus to the idea, which would mark a big policy change for the 16-nation alliance. France and some others had hesitated over the proposal to extend Nato responsibilities. France, which feels that the US has too large a say in how European security is run, would prefer to develop other institutions like the nine-nation Western European Union.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Czechoslovakia makes bold leap to people's capitalism: In a couple of months two out of three citizens will be shareholders in ex-state enterprises 
text:  IN THE basement of the federal statistics office in Prague, at the end of a dark corridor littered with empty cardboard boxes, a computer is busy calculating the wishes of 8.5m people. Throughout the summer, the large Digital computer will be allocating the shares of more than 3,000 state-owned enterprises to Czechs and Slovaks who earlier this year subscribed to the mass privatisation scheme launched by the Czechoslovak government. In the space of a couple of months, the unique scheme will turn two out of three citizens into shareholders and make more than half the country's state-owned enterprises private. The rule of the game is speed: the aim is to privatise fast, using book value to set the price of an enterprise's equity and to create a mass of shareholders who, ideally, will then exercise control over the enterprises. If it works, policy-makers say, the model privatisation handbook for former communist countries will be able to be written, based on the Czechoslovak experience. But a number of problems could arise as the scheme unfolds. Since last autumn, government officials in Czechoslovakia have been turning grey trying to unravel a myriad of privatisation projects. In the Czech republic alone, 10,000 projects for 2,500 enterprises have been prepared at government request by managers, deputy directors, employees or outside investors. The average enterprise is expected to offer about 60 per cent of its equity to the voucher programme. But enterprises may offer up to 97 per cent with a minimum of 3 per cent of their equity set aside for the restitution fund. This fund compensates former owners who were illegally expropriated by the communist regime. There are also various forms of partial privatisation, including direct sales to a local or foreign investors, public auctions or sale to other parties such as employees, management or municipalities. A total of 292.6bn korunas (Dollars 9.7bn) in equity will be distributed in the form of vouchers. Of this amount, 185.3bn korunas belongs to enterprises in the Czech republic and 93.5bn to Slovak enterprises with the remaining 13.8bn representing equity in properties owned by the federal authorities. This equity will be distributed to 8.5m citizens who subscribed to the scheme by buying a book of vouchers for 1,000 korunas, the equivalent of a week's salary for the average employee. In nominal terms, every voucher book should be worth 30,000 korunas in equity, calculated on a book value basis. Actual values however could differ significantly once market prices are established. Last Monday, voucher holders begun choosing the shares they want to receive. A first allocation of shares is planned early next month in instances where the demand for shares matches the offer of vouchers. Enterprises for which the demand surpasses the supply of vouchers by more than 25 per cent, however, will be re-offered for higher bids. A total of five bidding rounds is planned and the whole process could take until the autumn. Confused by the choice of enterprises and often lacking basic information, two-thirds of investors have entrusted their vouchers to private investment funds who which will select enterprises for them. More than 400 funds have been created in recent months to benefit from the privatisation programme but the bulk of vouchers are concentrated in the 10 biggest. The most popular funds belong to the Czech or Slovak banks, but other funds set up by private entrepreneurs have successfully wooed a large number of voucher holders by offering a guaranteed ten-fold cash return in a year's time. Such promises have raised eyebrows in government circles, however, and could provoke a liquidity crisis if the newly-privatised shares have to be sold to raise the cash to honour such promises and meet operational costs. In an economy where quality assets are rare, the pressure to sell could endanger the nascent stock market. It could also allow foreign investors to buy equity cheaply - a possibility that could meet political resistance at a later stage. A functioning, liquid secondary market will be needed to allow shareholders to concentrate their stakes and build up controlling stakes in enterprises. This stage will be crucial to facilitate the much-needed restructuring of Czechoslovak enterprises. The speed of the privatisation process has met domestic resistance, with critics claiming that the government should have allowed more time for restructuring. But Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister who is the political godfather of the Czechoslovak privatisation programme, recently summed up the argument for speed. Any strategy, he said, was better than leaving enterprises in the current paralysing grip of 'pre-privatisation agonies' where they were accumulating debts with other enterprises and selling vital assets just to pay wage bills as the enterprises crumble around them.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Russia says Crimea was illegal gift 
text:  THE Russian parliament yesterday adopted a potentially explosive resolution declaring illegal the transfer of the Crimea peninsula to Ukraine in 1954. Deputies approved by a slim majority a resolution saying the 'gift' proposed by the then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and rubberstamped by an obedient Communist parliament was unconstitutional and had no legal force. The vote, coming hours after the Crimean parliament rescinded an independence declaration under pressure from Kiev, is likely to aggravate the already difficult relations between Ukraine and Russia. It could also expose Russia to a host of territorial claims from other republics and national minorities. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Georgia are already unstable because of disputes over borders drawn under the Soviet era.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / UN in disarray as Serbs halt Croatia pullout: Fears grow that war could break out anew in Croatia 
text:  THE future of the United Nations peace plan for Croatia was yesterday thrown into disarray after the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army announced it was halting its withdrawal from the east of the republic. The army statement coincided with renewed calls to the international community by Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, to send troops into the besieged city of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The military statement said the army had decided to halt its planned withdrawal and would 'undertake measures to defend its territory, population, and its forces in eastern Slavonija, Baranja, and Western Srem, Serb-occupied territories in Croatia'. The army's withdrawal is a key element of the UN plan agreed last December between Croatia, the UN and the Yugoslav federal army. Western diplomats said the army's statement could mean the start of another war in Croatia. But a UN official, anxious to salvage its peace mission in Croatia last night said the delay in the army's withdrawal was only suspended. She said the evacuation of the protected areas was supposed to be on a mutual basis, adding that three Croatian tanks had failed to pull back from the eastern sector. General Satish Nambiar, the UN commander, was holding negotiations with army commanders. However, western diplomats expressed serious doubts over the success of the UN operation. 'Time is running out,' a senior defence attache said. 'We are faced with delays in Croatia. It is becoming tense there again. We have talked about sending in aircraft to relieve Sarajevo, we have talked about imposing a wide range of sanctions. But we must have the political will to stop Serbia and to prevent the war from spreading to Kosovo and other parts of the Balkans,' he said. Yesterday, armed Serb militiamen finally allowed 6,000 Moslem women and children to travel to the western Croatian city of Split. They had been held hostage on the outskirts of Sarajevo by Serb gunmen demanding that food be allowed into the federal army barracks in Sarajevo. But the federal army and Serb irregulars continue to deny the people of Sarajevo any food, medicine and water. 'The army is starving the city into submission. Why is it that western aircraft can protect the air space for the Kurds, but it is unwilling to protect the air space and free the airport in Sarajevo in order to feed our people,' Mr Silajdzic said. Serb forces already control two-third of Bosnia. In Austria, Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister, said the only chance to secure peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina was to create a restricted security zone around Sarajevo. In Brussels, Mr Willem van Eekelen, secretary-general of the nine-member Western European Union (WEU) criticised European Community states for their reluctance to use force to stop the fighting in Yugoslavia. Mr van Eekelen said 'We recognised these republics (Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegopared to defend those countries.' 'I think we have to do more to remain credible and faithful to our own principles,' he said. In Lisbon, attempts to reconvene the EC-sponsored peace talks stalled after Moslem representatives from Bosnia were unable to travel outside the republic. Mr Silajdzic said the peace talks were being undermined by Serbia. 'None of the agreement set down at the previous talks have been fulfilled. The roads (in Bosnia) have not been unblocked, and the airport has not been freed. Our country is being overtaken by fascists,' he said. In Bosnia, Borba, the Belgrade daily reported that General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Serb army of Bosnia, demanded martial law for all Serbian-controlled territory, including suspension of all civilian institutions.

text:  RUSSIA yesterday moved swiftly to signal its support for the republic of Armenia following Turkish threats of military intervention in its conflict with Azerbaijan. Yesterday Mr Gennady Burbulis, Russian president Boris Yeltsin's top aide, General Pavel Grachev, the new defence minister, and Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, head of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, flew to Yerevan, Armenia's capital, for talks with the republic's leaders on the status of its seventh army based in Armenia. The conclusion of a treaty permitting the stationing of Russian troops in another state would be the first such agreement since Russia decided to form its own army last month. It would also send a clear signal to Turkey and Azerbaijan that Armenia is in Russia's sphere of interest. The talks come just two days after Mr Turgut Ozal, the Turkish president, threatened to send introops after reports-denied by Armenia - of the entry of Armenian soldiers into the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan, situated between the borders of Armenia, Turkey and Iran. Marshal Shaposhnikov warned two days ago that such intervention could 'create a third world war'. However, yesterday, Mr Burbulis said he 'ruled out' a Turkish intervention. There are also fears the broader conflict between Armenia (supported by Russia) and Azerbaijan (supported by Turkey) over the Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh could escalate into a regional conflict. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, are due to hold talks in Ankara on Monday. Reuter adds from Baku: Commonwealth border troops near the Turkish frontier have been put on alert after a night of fighting between Azeri and Armenian forces around Nakhichevan. The Turkish foreign ministry said Armenian units were firing on Nakhichevan from their side of the border.

headline:  FT  22 MAY 92 / Teasing out Milan's Swiss connection: Haig Simonian on an off-shore banking probe in Italy's expanding financial scandal 
text:  THE fast train for Lugano leaves Milan's vaulted central station at 25 minutes past the hour precisely. The 50-mile journey takes almost an hour-and-a-half, lengthened by passport controls and a change of engines at the Swiss border. It is quicker by car, and probably a lot more comfortable in the sort of chauffeur-driven Lancia or Alfa Romeo saloon issued as standard to senior Italian corporate or party functionaries. Either way, it is a journey which may have become familiar to many of the politicians and businessmen who have either been arrested, or are under investigation, by magistrates in Milan in what is fast becoming the country's biggest political corruption scandal since the war. Three months of investigations since the arrest in February of Mr Mario Chiesa, the Socialist administrator who spilled the beans on a still widening web of urban skulduggery, has brought the Swiss link increasingly into the open. The network of bribes paid by local companies in return for lucrative public-sector building and maintenance contracts and funnelled to the city's main political parties by apparatchiks and city councillors originated in Milan. But the trail has already led to Lugano, the capital of the Swiss canton of Ticino, which has for decades played the role of off-shore banking centre for trates believe they have stumbled upon a network of bribes and corruption which has seen at least L150bn (Pounds 68m) changing hands over recent years. While much of the money has gone into party coffers in a largely institutionalised form of percentage takes on big contracts, part has been destined for personal enrichment. magistrates sent their colleagues across the border a list of names of individuals suspected of involvement in the affair. The Swiss were asked to ascertain under new laws whether those included held bank accounts in the canton; the laws have opened up a chink in Switzerland's famed banking secrecy for funds that are believed to have been 'recycled'. Speaking on Italian radio earlier this week, Ms Carla Del Ponte, the Lugano magistrate working with the Italian authorities, confirmed that information had already been provided regarding Mr Chiesa. However, the Italian requests for information have now run aground. At a closed-doors meeting earlier this week, a committee of the Ticino bankers' association advised members to take legal action to block further requests for information. The path to Lugano has become familiar to thousands of rich Milanese over the years, who have traditionally used the town to hide money which they did not want the local tax man to see. Non-lira bank accounts are no longer illegal for Italians, and the country's fiscal authorities have, so far, taken a back seat to the magistrates in the Milan investigation. But the scandal has clearly put the Swiss on the spot and could test the scope of the more open rules on access to bank accounts. Many banks in Lugano, which draw a large number of clients from northern Italy, fear a substantial loss of business should they appear overly co-operative towards the latest requests for information. A lot of money could be at stake. Few believe the Milan affair is an isolated incident. Kickbacks on big public-sector contracts are widely believed to be endemic in Italy's biggest cities, with the money flowing to political parties in the north and to organised crime in the south. But Milan has proved particularly easy to milk in recent years. Italy's second biggest city and financial capital has enjoyed a boom in infrastructural projects, which have made it a model of sorts in Italy. Among the costliest schemes has been the third underground line, completed last year at a price of around L2,500bn. The ambitious project to build a rail-link deep under the city, which is still a long way from being realised, is now expected to cost around L4,000bn. Further projects include the expansion of the second airport at Malpensa, now forecast to cost L450bn. Meanwhile, the breathtaking renovation of the San Siro football stadium in time for the 1990 World Cup cost L180bn. The list excludes the hundreds of smaller contracts awarded for hospital modernisation or more limited new construction projects in recent years. Many were entrusted to local building companies, some of whose bosses have now been implicated in the scandal. And even less conspicuous are the thousands of renewable service contracts for public buildings. These alone probably formed as rich a vein of funds as the big public works projects now under investigation.

text:  THE major powers may have to use force to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in Third World countries, the International Institute of Strategic Studies warns today. Regional efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, ballistic missiles and advanced conventional forces 'increasingly threaten not just regional stability, but even the global stability brought about by the end of superpower rivalry,' the London-based institute said in its annual Strategic Survey. If those on the verge of acquiring weapons of mass destruction could not be persuaded voluntarily to reverse their policies, the major powers might be forced to make them change their minds. However the IISS dismissed as 'laughable' any idea US forces could act as a 'globo-cop'. The Institute suggested that 1995, when 146 signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty meet, might be the time for the nuclear power states to substantially cut their armaments.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (12): Fiscal restraint needed - The success of deregulation depends on curbing borrowing 
text:  'OUR main preoccupation' says Mr Dominic Mulaisho, the new governor of the Bank of Zambia 'is to free the system'. He has been as good as his word. The financial markets have been the target of sweeping reforms culminating in the unification of the official and free market exchange rates a fortnight ago. Before Christmas too, the Bank of Zambia plans to launch a Treasury bill auction system - the final step in interest rate deregulation. The previous administration was forced by the IMF and World Bank to accept financial sector reform in 1989 but after dipping its toe in the water, it beat a hasty retreat. The Kaunda government's final year in office (1991) was a monetary disaster, with money supply increasing 100 per cent and inflation running at 400 per cent. As a result of this and the drought, the mid-1992 public sector wage awards, devaluation and increased export earnings, inflation has remained out of control. Money supply over 1992 is likely to double, while inflation is estimated at 120 per cent. The central bank has done everything possible to regain control over the monetary aggregates, abandoning interest rate capping, retaining control over the Treasury bill rate - a key component - which is pegged at 54 per cent. It raised the statutory reserve and 'inner reserve' ratios to about 67 per cent, which means banks are able to lend only K33 for every K100 of deposits. The paradoxical result is a market with money supply growing at 100 per cent, primarily the result of government borrowing and export receipts, while a banking system strapped for cash is lending to prime customers at 70 to 75 per cent. The explanation is simple. As fast as the government pumps liquidity into the system - in the year to August, government borrowing from the banks, including the Bank of Zambia, rose 300 per cent - the central bank is sterilising it with its high reserve ratios. But sterilisation, especially of the 'excess' earnings of the copper mines - earnings over and above the agreed price - was not effective in the third quarter and this, combined with the budget deficit pushed money supply growth above the IMF target ceilings. Solving the problem will mean stopping government borrowing from the banks, which in turn means eliminating the budget deficit or funding that deficit in a non-inflationary way by borrowing from the non-bank private sector. The central bank's courageous reforms will work only if the 1993 budget bites the bullet of fiscal restraint, opening the door to reduced money supply growth and inflation and relative exchange rate stability. The new auction system for Treasury bills means the authorities will replace control over the cost of government's short-term borrowings with control over the quantity of funds raised. This is likely to mean a further rise in interest rates which are expected to become positive in real terms during 1993 as inflation falls. Money supply growth and inflation should average less than 50 per cent next year, while on a year-on-year basis they should fall below 20 per cent towards the end of 1993. The foreign exchange market has been progressively liberalised with export retentions increased in March from 50 per cent to 100 per cent for 'non-traditional exporters'. From the end of April, individuals were allowed to tap the more favourable rate in the retentions market to convert foreign currency into Kwacha. The two big reforms came more recently. In mid-October, the bureau de change system opened allowing Zambians and foreigners to buy and sell foreign currency on a 'no questions asked' basis. This system has largely replaced the parallel market, although some black market transactions continue. Its importance, according to Mr Mulaisho, is that Zambians themselves, not the government or central bank, now decide at what rate they wish to buy foreign exchange. Two weeks ago, the official rate - at the time K247 to the dollar - was merged with the bureau and retentions market rate of K323. The government is now out of the exchange rate market although it retains influence on the supply of foreign exchange earned by the copper mines. The merging of the two exchange rate markets will spawn another inflationary blip. But if the ministry of finance delivers the promised balanced budget in January, government borrowing will fall, as will the rate of money supply growth and the yield on Treasury bills. As this happens the authorities will be able to reduce the banks' liquidity ratios enabling them to lend more to private enterprise. The banks - while victims of some of these reforms and complaining that policy changes have been implemented too quickly - are delighted with the general thrust of government policy. Their worries include having sufficient resources to finance the agriculture-led recovery which, weather permitting, Zambia hopes to achieve in 1993 as well as being able to provide medium and even longer-term funds in a country which has no capital market infrastructure. This is a gaping hole which urgently needs to be tackled. There are plans to set up a Stock Exchange and some of the banks talk of launching equity funds or venture capital arms to finance private sector investment. The success of monetarism, Zambian-style depends on conquering inflation, which will be a long haul, and on shifting the focus of banking activities away from funding the government to financing the movers and shakers in the private sector on whom the ultimate fate of the economic reform programme depends.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (11): A secret too well kept - While its minister is optimistic for the future, tourism lacks lustre 
text:  WITH attractions that range from the sandy beaches of Lake Tanganyika to the Luangwa game parks, the Victoria Falls, Lake Kariba and the magnificent Zambezi River, tourism in Zambia should be booming. In fact, the potential has barely been tapped. Private sector initiative was stifled during the Kaunda era, state-run hotels were inefficient, the infrastucture deteriorated as the economy declined and many would-be visitors were put off by the wars in the region. Meanwhile poaching flourished, often with the assistance of senior government officials. Overcoming this legacy will be a demanding task. The sector needs substantial investment at a time when government resources are scarce. The expansion of hotel capacity and allocation of new hunting concessions and sites for new game lodges needs careful planning. The expected growth in the numbers of private safari operators needs supervision. So far, there is little evidence that the country's tourist authorities have come to grips with the challenge. One pressing problem is that of Zambia Airways, the unreliable state-owned airline now facing privatisation, which is a heavily subsidised national liability. Nor does the National Tourist Board inspire confidence: its drab office off Lusaka's Cairo Road, display windows bare but for fading posters, offers a useful glossy brochure but no more. Visitors are directed to travel agents, many of whom seem better informed about holiday packages in London than expeditions to the Luangwa Valley, which offers some of the best game viewing in Africa. The poor local presentation of what Zambia has to offer may not affect the visitor arriving on a package trip sold to them by their local agents but it is a striking contrast with the energetic way in which Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa are competing in the tourist market. Since the Victoria Falls, Kariba and the Zambezi river are shared with Zimbabwe, the competition is especially tough. But if optimism is the main ingredient of a successful revamp of the sector, Mr Christian Tembo, the former army general who holds the tourism portfolio, is the man for the job. Visitors will double by the end of 1995 to from current levels to just under 400,000, forecasts Mr Tembo, and foreign exchange earnings will top Dollars 115m. The devaluation of the kwacha, Zambia's more favourable international image as a multi-party democracy, vigorous marketing abroad and lifting restrictions on South African passport holders will all help to meet this target, says the minister. Existing hotels operate well below capacity - the national average for room occupation is around 50 per cent. Meanwhile Mr Tembo anticipates that both quality and capacity will rise: there have been over 80 applications from abroad (over half from South Africa) to take over and upgrade existing hotels or build new ones. Incentives for investors are generous, notes the minister, and include a tax free period of up to seven years. Business travel guide Few countries in Africa can match the warmth of Zambia's welcome to the visitor. But be prepared for frustrations - years of economic decline have taken a heavy toll: hotels need refurbishing, car hire fleets need replacing, taxis are on their last set of bald tyres, the telephone service can be erratic. Lusaka is the capital and seat of government, but the industrial hub is the Copperbelt towns of Ndola and Kitwe. Zambia Airways has daily flights to the Copperbelt but many businessmen prefer a private operator, Roan Air. For a short break from Lusaka, try Lilayi Lodge (Lusaka 228682/3), a cluster of thatched rondavels with swimming pool and situated at the heart of a private game reserve, 30 minutes' drive from Lusaka. An hour away is Lechwe Lodge (Lusaka 222083/4), on the banks of the Kafue River, set in 2,000 acres of private game ranch. Zintu, at the Ridgeway Hotel, has an excellent range of traditional and modern Zambian handicrafts and the Mpapa gallery art gallery is worth visiting.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (8): Turning point for farming - Severe drought and radical reforms have transformed the sector 
text:  IT HAS been the year of the drought in Zambia. But it has also been a year which has seen the most fundamental agricultural reforms since independence. Provided government implements the overall economic reform programme, farmers may well look back on 1992 as a turning point in agriculture's fortunes. Given normal weather, says Mr Guy Scott, the energetic minister of agriculture, 1993 could be the year when Zambia started to realise the potential of what Mr Scott, a former farmer, describes as the country's most valuable resource - 9m hectares of good arable land, of which only a fifth is utilised. The impact of the region's worst drought in living memory makes conventional assessment of Zambia's agricultural sector almost impossible, the minister acknowledges. But the statistics of a disaster which has brought about a 10 per cent fall in GDP this year are ready to hand. The country's staple food  -the maize crop - has been devastated and many farmers are fighting for survival. Yet Zambia has emerged remarkably well from what could have become a catastrophe, Mr Scott points out. The government and non-government organisations (NGOs) have joined forces to run a widely acclaimed relief operation which may provide lessons for the rest of Africa. Rains for the 1991-2 season were 60 per cent below normal, and the marketable surplus of maize normally around 1.2m tons, fell to 250,000 tons. At the end of February the government declared a national disaster and set in train efforts to find and distribute 950,000 tons of feed grains. By May 245,000 tons of maize had been bought by government from its own resources. Donor assistance in cash and kind ensured that the food supply target was met. However, ensuring the food reaches those in greatest need and that food aid is not manipulated by government and politicians for profit or patronage proved more difficult. The Zambian solution was 'to remove the temptation and to cut the red tape', as one official put it. An NGO was created with government's blessing to help handle the disaster. Overseeing the exercise is the Programme to Prevent Malnutrition - a committee chaired by the minister of health and including representatives of the ministries of agriculture, finance, water affairs and community development. Working with government officials are representatives of the World Food Programme, Unicef and a wide range of NGOs, churches and community organisations. But crucial to the success of the relief operation has been an NGO created for the operation, the Programme against Malnutrition, whose staff backs up the aid organisations, reports on the use of donated food to the World Food Programme and accounts for aid funds to the ministry of finance and donors. Committees covering the drought-affected areas include community leaders drawn from churches, hospitals and schools. The PPM provides money to NGOs to subsidise transport costs of taking food to remote areas. Families unable to pay for maize participate in food-for-work schemes, ranging from mending rural roads to repairing schools desk. The old and the sick receive free food. It is, say donors, one of Africa's most efficient food relief projects. But equally important, says Mr Scott, are the radical changes being made in agricultural policy. According to a recent editorial in Productive Farming, the journal of the National Farmers' Union, since independence 'one of the main obstacles to farming progress was the gross inefficiency of the state marketing system. It was illegal to sell maize and other scheduled crops except to authorised government bodies'. It goes on: 'Bureaucracy, inefficiency, theft, painfully slow handling of crops, wasteful distribution and storage, failure to provide farming inputs, long delays between crop delivery and payment, all contributed to a dismal performance, costly to the tax payer and infuriating to the farmer'. To the delight of farmers - including some 400 white farmers - the government has drastically reduced state intervention since taking office. Subsidies on maize meal have been eliminated and producer prices have risen. Market forces will determine the price for the coming season. Should it prove necessary to import maize, government has undertaken not to sell it below Dollars 14 per 90kg bag. Marketing of fertiliser has also been decontrolled. Subsidies have ended, as has the state monopoly on fertiliser imports. Although the Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia is likely to stay the market leader, it has lost its monopoly. But the success of reforms will depend on how government handles credit facilities for cash-strapped farmers. All financing for 1993 domestic maize purchases will be handled by private sector. But tight credit restrictions and high interest rates, make government intervention likely, says Mr John Hudson, editor of Productive Farming. Mr Scott acknowledges that credit facilities for agriculture will be a crucial issue in the months to come. But he knows it will be no easy task to strike the right balance between helping the farmers and persisting with tough economic reforms.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (10): Tackling new competitors - Profile of Dunlop 
text:  MR BOB MAY, managing director of Dunlop Zambia is the kind of industrialist Zambia needs. A blunt, straight-talking Scot, his task is to bring Dunlop's Ndola tyre factory up to speed to face the new competition from direct imports sourced in South Africa and the Far East. His approach is a refreshing blend of optimism, hard-headed realism and entrepreneurial flair. He has to convince his London shareholder, BTR, with its reputation for running a tight ship, that Zambia is a country worthy of a Dollars 7m investment in the modernisation of the tyre factory, giving foreign competitors a run for their money while convincing BTR an acceptable hard-currency will be earned, remittable return on its investment. In a country with three-digit inflation and a tumbling exchange rate this is no easy task. Dunlop is able to beat the imported competition partly because it can undercut suppliers burdened with the amalgam of transport costs, devaluation, import duties and massive importer margins. But earning an adequate hard-currency return when the exchange rate has fallen is a formidable task, the more so since 'existing' investors, of which Dunlop is one, may remit only 15 per cent of their paid-up capital or half after-tax profits, whichever is the lesser. Dunlop plans a modest investment - Dollars 7m over four years - in modernising its plant, drawing on technology from Dunlop International Technology in Birmingham. By mid-1993, Dunlop Zambia will introduce a new generation of tyres, capable of double the mileage of existing products. The Dunlop story is a familiar one for those with experience of structural adjustment elsewhere in Africa. After 15 years or more of a de facto monopoly, Dunlop is now faced with competition from half a dozen direct importers. An industry where marketing used to mean rationing supplies to desperate buyers has changed beyond all recognition. 'We have to change the marketing mindset,' says Mr May, who is sending his sales staff to work with Dunlop Nigeria to learn how to market in a competitive environment. Skills are a problem. The expatriate count is down to six from 17 in 1985. 'We would like to get it down to three,' says Mr May because expatriate staff are 'savagely expensive'. One way out is networking within the region, sharing skills with the larger, more modern factory at Bulawayo in neighbouring Zimbabwe. If Dunlop's three main investor groups - BTR has a controlling 57 per cent stake, the government 26 per cent and Anglo American Corporation 16 per cent  -agree, the modernisation project will go ahead and qualify for the new investment incentives introduced towards the end of 1991. Mr May is optimistic about Zambia's industrial potential arguing that existing firms alone have the scope to expand operations by 30 per cent to 40 per cent although this will have to await the strong farm-led economic recovery forecast for 1993.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (9): Foreign interest mounts - While investments are as yet only intentions, figures look good 
text:  A NEW investment code and a new government is doing wonders for Zambia's foreign investment performance. The country's one-stop investment centre, set up little more than a year ago when the 1991 Investment Act became law, approved more than 440 projects worth Dollars 650m in the first nine months of 1992. The new investment act targets five main areas - agriculture, non-traditional exports, import substitution, tourism and 'rural projects'. The value of investment figures look extremely high, but officials are quick to point out that this represents intentions rather than 'investment on the ground', and that approved projects might never be implemented. Furthermore, the numbers relate both to domestic and foreign investment. A more conservative figure is that for investment licences actually issued, which lag behind projects approved. But even here the figures are impressive  -300 licences issued during the first 10 months of 1992 for projects valued at Dollars 300m. Figures for the first half of the year, in which 130 licences were issued, show foreign exchange 'pledges', as one investment centre official calls them, of Dollars 128m or 95 per cent of the total value of licences, implying that the domestic component is only small. Investments in these five categories, including expansion projects by existing firms, qualify for a range of investment incentives, including a three-year tax holiday (followed by two years of 75 per cent tax exemption), a seven-year tax-holiday on dividends and selective employment tax, exemption from import and sales taxes and generous export retention allowances. The investment code also provides guarantees against expropriation and allows investors to remit up to 75 per cent of after-tax profits, along with the principal and interest on foreign loans, management fees and royalties and the proceeds of asset sales. The Investment Centre chairman, Mr Evans Chibiliti, makes no secret of the fact that his organisation has some way to go before he will be satisfied that it is fully effective. No structures were in place, he says, until early this year, and initially a backlog of project approvals built up, although this has now been cleared to the point where the centre is able to respond within 30 days of an application being received, as stipulated in the act. Investors are not required to submit projects through the centre, nor does it claim to be a fully one-stop operation. Even after acquiring his licence, the investor still has to do the rounds of the Ministry of Lands, the Bank of Zambia and the immigration authorities. The bulk of the inquiries come from medium and small-scale operators and not the big multinationals. South Africa has shown considerable interest, although much of it through the note-book rather than the cheque-book. White farmers from Zimbabwe have been taking a look at maize, tobacco and horticultural projects, while many existing Zambian firms are expanding and refurbishing manufacturing operations. Critics say existing investors are unhappy at an incentive package favouring the newcomers, arguing that Zambia would do better to cut its corporate tax, provide guarantees of remittability and abandon the idea of targeted tax holidays and other incentives. Centre officials reject this 'level playing field' argument on the grounds that changes to an investment code, launched less than 18 months ago, would send the wrong signals. 'What investors want is policy consistency,' says Mr Chibiliti, although he favours broadening the range of priority sectors to include healthcare, education and finance. In spite of this, the government will come forward with important changes to the code in the budget next month, with businessmen hoping for a lower rate of company tax and more generous remittability conditions, rather than targeted incentives.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (5): The mood changes - Recovery is in sight but hard evidence is lacking 
text:  AFTER more than a decade during which Zambian economic management was the butt of cruel jokes, many of them justified, the Zambian economy is on the mend. But for now, recovery is more a matter of a radical change of mood since the new administration took office, with little concrete evidence, other than sweeping deregulation, that the corner has been turned. 'We are pointing in the right direction,' says Mr David Frost, chairman of the Zambia Confederation of Industries and Chambers of Commerce 'but the vehicle is stationery, if not still slipping backwards'. Figures bear this out. Inflation still running at 100 per cent - but down from 400 per cent in the dying days of the Kaunda administration - money supply is still out of control, GDP is forecast to fall 10 per cent in 1992 and a pre-rescheduling debt-service ratio of stands at 65 per cent of exports. But there are some chinks of light. The 1992 budget deficit, excluding external debt-service, is down to 2.5 per cent of GDP from 7.5 per cent a year ago. If drought relief is taken from the numbers, the deficit is only 0.9 per cent - a remarkable achievement. The Chiluba government has had its share of bad luck. Early forecasts of marginal economic growth in 1992 were torpedoed by the drought. The Kaunda administration's desperate final spending spree, designed to buy votes, translated into surging inflation during 1992. This is turn sparked massive devaluation with the Kwacha tumbling from K85 to the dollar a year ago to K325 in early December. All agree that slaying the inflationary dragon is Zambia's top economic, and social, priority. The central bank, under the leadership of its new governor, Mr Dominic Mulaisho, has bravely liberalised financial and foreign exchange markets, pushing lending rates up to historic highs of 75 per cent or more for prime borrowers, and forcing the banks to hold two-thirds of their liabilities to the public in statutory or inner reserves. With the impending introduction of a Treasury Bill auction system, the central bank will have abandoned direct controls over interest rates as well as the exchange rate, leaving the markets to call the tune. 'We are democratising the economy,' says Mr Mulaisho. But there is only so much monetary policy can achieve when government borrowing is out of control. In the year to August, government borrowing from the banking system rose 300 per cent. Restoring monetary discipline now requires fiscal restraint. This is promised for 1993 when the government says it will present a balanced budget, based on cash limits. This means the government will borrow only from the market - not the Bank of Zambia - and solely to bridge the gap between expenditure outgoings and revenue inflows. At the same time, the cabinet is working on a 'constitutional formula' to prevent overspending by the line ministries. Cynics point out that budget balance was the target for 1992 and that one reason it was breached was because the planned 70 per cent public sector pay award escalated into one of 120 per cent. The drought added fuel to the flames as did Zambia Airways, reportedly losing Dollars 3m a month. Indeed, after meeting the IMF's benchmarks in the second quarter of the year, in the September quarter the targets were missed and Zambia failed to accumulate any 'rights' as part of the programme for repaying IMF arrears. Officials say the programme is now back on track and December benchmarks will be met, but all agree that the fate of the programme hangs on the budget to be presented by finance minister Emmanuel Kasonde at the end of January. In Paris last week, the government told a sympathetic donor community it would bring money supply down from its estimate of more than 70 per cent in 1992 to 17 per cent by the end of next year, while inflation would drop to 55 per cent and would be an annualised 20 per cent rate by the final quarter of 1993. These targets, the government says courageously, are minimum, not maximum, goals. Much can, and almost certainly will, go wrong. Few believe that Zambia has either the managerial skills or the institutional capacity to push through so challenging a reform programme without mishaps along the way. The debt overhang and the dependence on copper are further complications as is the deterioration of the infrastructure and a worsening AIDS epidemic. To these must be added two human problems: government recognition that the man in the street desperately needs to see some improvement in his living standards. 'The political honeymoon is not going to last much longer,' warns one international banker. Above all there is the problem of culture change. Zambia has long been a paternalist society. This mindset has to change. The experience of the past 28 years demonstrates that a government, even with the most laudable motives, cannot be a fairy godmother. Formidable though this task may be the transformation of the business mood is a reminder of the facts of economic life. Change at the top is a prerequisite for successful recovery and in its first year in office, the Chiluba administration has breathed new life into an economy which, 18 months ago, seemed in terminal decline. Investment is a contentious area. Zambia's investment code is 'the best in the region', according to Mr Bob May, managing director of Dunlop Zambia. But powerful voices in the business community believe it should be improved. Officials say the government will introduce further improvements in the investment code in the January budget. At the end of its first year in office, Mr Chiluba's government earns high marks for transparency, for its undisputed commitment to reform and for its courage. What remains in doubt is its ability to translate intentions into performance. Achievements made so far will count for little if, next year, the government fails the stiff fiscal test of stern budget discipline. With the local government elections behind it and no need to go the polls until 1996, now is the time to administer the fiscal dose without which economic decline will continue. But there can be no quick fix. Mr Nick Brentall, managing director of Barclays Bank, Zambia, puts it into context. 'It took us 27 years to get where we are. We are not going to get out of it in 27 months.'

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (6): Donor assistance essential - A four-pronged strategy is relieving the burden of Dollars 7bn of debt 
text:  WITH an external debt at the end of 1991 in excess of Dollars 7bn, Zambia is one of Africa's most debt-stressed economies. It has more debt per head of population than any other country in the region. It has since qualified for what are called 'enhanced Toronto' debt-relief terms, offering a menu of options to creditors, including 50 per cent debt forgiveness. But Zambia's position is unique to the extent that not only does debt owed to the multilaterals - the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank - (which technically cannot be rescheduled) make up 44 per cent of long-term obligations, but it is also in arrears to the IMF to the tune of Dollars 1.2bn. This makes it the IMF's second-largest arrears debtor after Sudan. The debt burden is less intimidating than the numbers (including a 65 per cent debt-service ratio in 1992) imply. Zambia has - technically - rescheduled the Dollars 1.2bn it owes the Fund through a Rights Accumulation Programme whereby, as long as it meets IMF benchmarks, it accumulates 'rights' of SDR83.7m (Dollars 114.5m) a quarter, which go towards paying off the arrears. By March 1995 Zambia should have accumulated sufficient rights to clear its IMF arrears thereby regaining access to Fund facilities. Once the arrears are paid off, Zambia will become eligible for the highly concessional Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility giving it up to 10 years to repay fresh IMF borrowings. This is just one strand of a four-pronged external debt strategy. The others include the July 1992 agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors at which Lusaka obtained Dollars 927m of debt relief. Some Dollars 585m of this took the form of 'enhanced concessions' while the balance of Dollars 343m was 'extra-ordinary relief', by which is meant a deferment of payments. Seven donor countries, including the UK, US and Germany, have so far agreed to write off all, or some, of their development loans. A third element is a proposed private and commercial debt buyback, although this scheme is still in its infancy. The World Bank is offering Dollars 20m and Zambia hopes to attract support from other donors giving it a cash chest of Dollars 100m to buyback the Dollars 120m owed to the commercial banks and other private debt. The fourth leg of the strategy - new donor disbursements for project financing - has proved disappointing. These are estimated at Dollars 200m in 1992, lower than in 1991 and well short of expectations. The problem is the failure of line ministries to put together the bankable projects that donors can support. Before rescheduling, Zambia's 1992 debt-service bill was estimated at Dollars 835m of which Dollars 269m was owned to the multilaterals, more than half of it to the Fund and almost Dollars 500m to bilateral donors. Its 'enhanced Toronto' terms have reduced its Paris Club debt-service from more than Dollars 450m to Dollars 45m this year and Dollars 55m in 1993. Next year, Zambia is hoping for donor assistance of Dollars 1.4bn of which Dollars 400m will take the form of debt relief, while the balance will be Dollars 500m in balance of payments support, Dollars 200m in commodity aid and Dollars 300m in project finance. Without donor assistance, the balance of payments would be unmanageable with an overall payments deficit averaging almost Dollars 650m in 1992/3. This is largely a product of the debt situation, with pre-rescheduling interest payments of over Dollars 300m in 1993 and capital repayments of a further Dollars 365m. Substantial donor help is crucial - to ease the debt burden and help build a platform for the growth of non-traditional exports in the mid-1990s, without which Zambia will remain at the mercy of the fortunes of the copper industry.  ------------------------------------------------------------           BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 1991-93 (DOLLARS M)  ------------------------------------------------------------                          1991       1992     1993 Exports                 1,082      1,050    1,000 Copper exports            895        750      710 Imports                   950      1,080    1,070 Trade balance             132        -30      -70 Net invisibles           -548       -535     -490 Transfers                 480        230      220 Current account            64       -335     -340 Net capital              -259       -275     -340 Overall balance          -230       -610     -680  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: IMF  ------------------------------------------------------------

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (7): Committed approach - Privatisation 
text:  NO AFRICAN government is tackling privatisation with the enthusiasm demonstrated by the MMD administration. As a government of businessmen it has a strong ideological commitment to the programme underpinned by the more pragmatic consideration that subsidising inefficient parastatals is no longer viable. Within five years, the government plans to sell more than 150 state-owned enterprises, accounting for 80 per cent of economic activity. 'Almost everything you touch in this country is government-owned,' says one businessman. There are no sacred cows, although the minister responsible for privatisation, Mr Ronald Penza, attracted considerable flak, especially from the unions, when he announced that government would not retain a majority stake in either the copper mines or the public utilities. This stance may have to be revised since it might be impossible to sell the railways or Zesco, the Zambia Electricity Supply Co. Should it prove impossible to find buyers, on satisfactory terms, the Zambia Privatisation Agency, set up in August, will have to fall back on commercialisation. But its remit is clear: to get the government out of business and its board and officials are determined to do that. Nineteen small parastatals are currently under the hammer - with a combined turnover of K1.8bn - with competitive bids for 17 enterprises opened this month while the ZPA is negotiating the sale of the other two with minority shareholders. The initial 17 have a combined turnover of K1.8bn, although three are dormant operations and one, Prime Marble Products, is in the development stage. They include a dry cleaning business, a travel agency, vehicle spares and tyre firms and manufacturers of hardware, tin cans, plastics and pharmaceuticals. ZPA officials describe the response as 'overwhelming'. Over 180 tender packages were sold for the 15 companies about 15 per cent of them to foreign-owned firms. A total of 37 bids was received for the first six companies offered, including bids from Botswana, South Africa and a Swiss-French firm. In all six cases, management and employees submitted bids to buy-out the firms. While some would have preferred a bolder strategy, ZPA officials say the decision to launch the programme with small, easily saleable enterprises was not a 'soft option' strategy. 'We wanted to demonstrate beyond any possible doubt that we really are serious about privatisation,' says one official. This is in marked contrast to the previous administration's on-off approach. In any event, it was necessary to push ahead with relatively simple sales in order to satisfy donor pressure and comply with World Bank conditions. The July 1992 legislation to set up an independent privatisation agency to implement the programme - replacing the Technical Committee on Privatisation created by the Kaunda administration - has shifted it out of the political arena and into the hands of the technocrats. The agency will need to refer major policy issues - such as the timing and method of privatising ZCCM - to the cabinet, but operationally it is on its own. The parastatals will be sold as they stand. The government has no intention of investing in any restructuring programme arguing instead that this should be left to the new owners. This is a sensible counter to 'selling the family silver' critics, since buyers will be forced to inject new capital into the enterprises to turn them around. A number of grey areas are still to be cleared such as whether and how the government will retain control over strategic enterprises, such as the oil refineries. This could be done on a 'golden share' basis or by retaining enough equity to guarantee effective control. One thing is clear. The government wants to see ownership spread among ordinary Zambians through public share issues and employment share ownership schemes. Although no stock exchange is in place yet, the ZPA is determined to float at least one of the 32 firms scheduled during 1993. The prime candidate is almost certainly Zambia Breweries, in which Anglo American is the largest private sector shareholder, although others, such as Zambia Sugar Refineries, Chilanga Cement and the milling companies, could also qualify. Under the new banking act, the banks will able to operate as stockbrokers, trading shares for their customers. But commitment is not everything. The ZPA, whose top managers have been in place less than two months, is short of skilled personnel. It will not find it easy to market some 50 companies within the next year, especially since Zambia has no domestic capital market while bank liquidity is under pressure as part of the anti-inflation programme. A worry is whether enough buyers will materialise to keep privatisation on track. 'It will be interesting to see how the 37 who submitted their bids plan to finance the takeovers,' says a banker, warning that 'they don't qualify as bankable prospects'. Lurking in the background are familiar political worries. Drought, recession and the restructuring of the economy has led to large scale retrenchment in a country in which only 360,000 people are employed in the formal economy. The parastatal sector employs 95,000 of these and as many as 40 per cent could lose their jobs once the new owners take control. This has the hallmark of political dynamite which is why a the ZPA will next year be marketing not just the companies but also the concept of privatisation.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (2): A delicate balance - Interview with President Frederick Chiluba 
text:  In an interview with Michael Holman, President Frederick Chiluba calls for further external debt relief, promises tough measures to tackle inflation and extends a welcome to foreign investors. Holman: After a year of reform, what is your assessment of the economy? Chiluba: We need more external support, especially debt relief. If we have to service the debt from our meagre resources, there will be nothing for our recovery. We appreciated getting the Trinidad terms (partial debt write-off) but more of our debt should be written off. It is a way of recognising the difference between this democratic government and its predecessor. If we are to make democracy work, we need a sound economic base, and that we are unable to provide without more help. If we lose this opportunity, I see no way out of the quagmire. What has been the effect of the drought? It's the worst in living memory and has been a very big set-back. We have lost 70 per cent of our maize crop. It's not only hitting agriculture. Energy supplies have been cut, so factory production falls. We expect more than a 12 per cent decline in per capita GDP this year. But government responded promptly to the drought and acted more efficiently than surrounding states, while the international community rallied magnificently and magnanimously. More cuts in government spending lie ahead, including reducing the civil service: how much punishment can Zambians take? It's a very thin line between what is perceived as structural adjustment and what is perceived as punishment. But the civil service must be reorganised. We inherited a civil service and a political service, both employed by the state. We have got to trim it, otherwise you are accepting the rot. We have also cut subsidies, which is painful - but now peasant farmers can sell maize at higher prices, and not only to the state but to private buyers. Socialist propaganda made people believe that the state should be the provider. I want to get government off peoples' shoulders and make them more self sufficient. But you have to carry people along while pursuing reform . . . it's a very delicate balance. How serious a threat is inflation? It's public enemy number one. It means no savings, no investment, purchasing power wiped out. We have already cut government spending and cut the size of government itself. We are not going to print money. We're determined to bring inflation down. Will the second year be as tough as the first? In the early stages, yes. But by the second half, with inflation tackled, there should be slight changes for the better. What role is there for foreign investors? We need them - the economy needs their capital, their technology, their skills and expertise. The privatisation programme provides opportunities, the business environment has been radically improved. If we do not get foreign investment, the reform programme will be jeopardised to a large extent. Will ZCCM (the state-owned copper mining company) be privatised? Yes - but the government should hold on to some of its shares, because we have to create investor confidence. They will know we still care if we hold on to some shares. Would you accept a bid for shares by Anglo American conditional on their taking over management of the mines? That can be worked out when discussions take place. But would you object in principle? Anglo might want to bring in some staff from outside, but they would be working with the local staff. There are many qualified Zambians. Are you concerned by corruption in Zambia? It is part of the legacy of the old system, which we are still fighting. One way to do this is to ensure greater transparency in government and more accountability. What principles will be most important when Zambia draws up a new constitution? Entrenching the rights of the individual at the expense of the executive. The most striking thing about the past year is the way people have rallied under the new freedom. Zambia is enjoying a breath of fresh air - people are free to take initiatives.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (3): Reversal of fortunes - Copper 
text:  AT THE bottom of the Nchanga Open Pit, the initials MMD are emblazoned on the cockpit of one of the giant shovels shifting ore in the pit which is the largest single source of copper at Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the company which dominates the Zambian economic landscape. It is an appropriate symbol because it is a reminder that the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy came to power in November 1991 on the back of organised labour, particularly the miners on the Copper Belt. The MMD's accession to power is the single factor accounting for the enormous turnaround in fortunes of ZCCM over the past year. Copper is the fly-wheel of the Zambian economy. It accounts for more than 90 per cent of the country's foreign exchange earnings and much of Zambia's manufacturing industry supplies the industry. Although the past 20 years have seen a steady decline in the Zambian industry's fortunes, historically the government derived more than 50 per cent of its revenues from taxes on copper sales. The 1992 financial year, to March, was a nadir for ZCCM. Repeated equipment failures - the result of government interference starving the company of necessary funds - saw ZCCM's copper production at an all-time low of 387,000 tonnes, 63,000 tonnes below the budgeted target of 450,000 tonnes. The company made a net profit of only K4.1bn. A turnaround commenced, however, when the MMD government installed a new management team in November 1991. Average monthly production in the last four months of the 1991/2 financial year was 37,500 tonnes - 27 per cent higher than the average 29,600 tonnes during the first eight months. The first eight months of the 1992/3 financial year have seen further progress. According to Mr Ed Shamutete, ZCCM's chief executive, production to the end of November was 4 per cent ahead of the target of 431,000 tonnes for the full year. If this is maintained for the full year, as Mr Shamutete believes it will be, the company should achieve production of close to 450,000 tonnes - a 16 per cent improvement over 1991/2. The company has also made progress in cutting costs. Mr Shamutete notes that the cost at mine (excluding interest, depreciation and capital expenditure, tax) has fallen from 73.5 cents per pound of copper produced in 1991/2 to 60.3 cents per pound in the seven months of the current year. By June 1993 the labour force will have been cut by about 10,000 to 46,000. All of this translates to considerable progress on the profit front. For the seven months to the end of October, ZCCM made net profits of K19.7bn, compared to budgeted figures for the period of K11.5bn. 'The results are very encouraging,' says Mr Shamutete. 'Things are going extremely well'. The improved cost, production and cost performances can be traced, in the first instance, to the access to power of the Chiluba government, committed to sound economic management. In ZCCM's case this involved installing new management with a mandate to return the company to its core business of mining metals. Assurances were also given, which the government has upheld, that it would not interfere in the running of the company. Crucially, the government has also given ZCCM the necessary foreign exchange allocation to allow for rational operational planning. Mr Shamutete confirms that the persistent shortage of foreign exchange through the Kaunda years has taken its toll on the company's infrastructure. In the short-medium term, Mr Shamutete says the company needs to spend about Dollars 150m in hard currency terms and Dollars 119m in local money equivalent annually for normal reinvestment. For the next five years the company can meet these commitments from its own resources and with recourse to short-term loan facilities already in place. What happens beyond this, however, is the question facing ZCCM's managers. During the next decade the massive Nchanga Open Pit will become uneconomic. Production from a replacement ore body must be in place in about seven years. The source of this production will be the Konkola deep project, in the North of the copper belt. A recent feasibility study revealed that a new mine, with ore reserves of about 355m tonnes and a mill head-grade of 3.5 to 3.6 per cent copper, could be developed within six years. Mr Shamutete says this mine should guarantee ZCCM maintaining an annual production level of 450,000 tonnes - possibly up to 500,000 tonnes - well into the future. He is hopeful the project will soon get the go-ahead. Konkola has a price tag of about Dollars 550m, 70 per cent of which will be in hard currency. Mr Shamutete says that over the next 14 years, ZCCM will have to spend about Dollars 1.3bn in foreign exchange and Dollars 700m in local currency, both in 1991 terms, to ensure sustained production at the 450,000 tonnes per annum level. The bulk of this will be spent on Konkola. Most likely is that ZCCM will develop Konkola itself, the required equity injection probably offering Anglo American the chance to increase its stake in the company. However the finance question is resolved, the improvement of ZCCM's balance sheet is a priority. Currently the company owes Dollars 722m to various lenders and has paltry share capital of K893m, against annual revenues of about Dollars 1.2bn - a testimony to neglect and abuse by the previous government, the majority shareholder, matched by an understandable unwillingness on the part of minorities to invest further in a poorly run company. Apart from a necessary capital injection, Mr Shamutete believes the debt can be restructured while assets, which have not kept pace with the devaluation of the Kwacha, need to be revalued.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (4): Grasping the nettle - The privatisation of ZCCM 
text:  QUESTIONS hang over whether, when and how the Zambian government will privatise Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the giant copper producer. Although the new government has shown a commendable willingness to take unpopular decisions, it is doubtful whether there is a larger nettle to grasp than the privatisation of ZCCM. Not only does the company remain the single dominant economic entity in the country - it has often in the past been referred to as a 'state within a state' - but it is also the repository for much emotional and ideological baggage. Within the miserable economic legacy of President Kaunda, the nationalisation of the copper industry probably ranks as the greatest act of folly. It took place in two stages: In January 1970, the industry was reorganised with the government taking 51 per cent of the two companies running the industry - Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines and Roan Consolidated Mines (merged into ZCCM in 1982). In late 1974, the government also took over the management of the mines, hitherto provided by companies associated with the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and AMAX. Nationalisation was disastrous. Strapped for cash, the government placed ever greater burdens on ZCCM forcing it into all sorts of peripheral activities at the expense of investment in the core business of mining metals. The result was a steady decline in production, slumping to a nadir of 387,000 tonnes of copper in the 1991/2 financial year from an average annual 600,000 tonnes combined production of Nchanga and Roan before they were merged into ZCCM. The Chiluba government came to power in November 1991 on a platform which included privatisation as a vital component of its economic programme. However, scepticism has persisted about its strength of conviction - fuelled a few months ago when vice-president Levy Mwanawasa said he favoured taking '20 to 30 years' over ZCCM's privatisation. Supporting this view, is the fact that the company's restored profitability gives the government less incentive to proceed with a sell-off. Second, many senior figures in government are intimately connected with the initial decision to nationalise the mines. Indeed, Mr Humphrey Mulemba, the incumbent minister of mines, presided over the nationalisation in 1970 in the same capacity as minister of mines. No matter what such men say in public, privatisation would involve a considerable humiliation. Furthermore, the government has already been accused of seeking to make a quick buck and may be anxious to dispel such accusations. However, the government will not want to compromise its hard-won economic reform credentials by bending to the wind over ZCCM. Baulking over the sell-off could also prompt the World Bank to make this a necessary condition for the provision of further aid. Ministers also appear committed, albeit for different reasons. Although Mr Mulemba cautions that the government must be 'very, very careful not to move carelessly', he adds that the privatisation of ZCCM is 'one of those things we would like to push as quickly as possible'. His reasoning is simple: maximising government spending options depends on putting ZCCM on a path of sustained profitability. This requires new private sector investment, which is most likely assured by withdrawing the spectre of government interference and control. Dr Mathias Mpande, deputy minister of mines is unequivocal that his priority as a minister is to achieve the turnaround of ZCCM through privatisation. 'If you're an economic nationalist, you're just a lost economic dinosaur in the world,' he says. Dr Mpande argues that whereas he originally envisaged a protracted debate of about a year, things are now going 'very quickly. All parties want to get it over'. The World Bank will be conducting a study, during the first quarter of 1993, which will come up with an action plan for ZCCM's privatisation. The other issue is what shape a sell-off would take. Mr Mulemba believes the government should maintain a minority stake, but says he is flexible depending on what will best foster investor confidence. Dr Mpande favours breaking up ZCCM into smaller units to attract as many foreign investors as possible, allowing the government to profit from competition between them. Although many of South Africa and the world's main resource groups have shown interest in the Zambian mining sector - RTZ, BHP, Phelps Dodge, Gencor and JCI among them - Anglo American, holder of a 27.3 per cent minority stake in ZCCM, is in pole position. Anglo has not disguised its interest in lifting its stake, and Dr Mpande says he takes it for granted this will be the case. 'When they come back they will be in charge of management, but there will be very little change. The people they need are already there. The human resource is there, but they can enrich it.' The chances of a total sell-off appear unlikely. The government will not want to forsake all influence over what is seen as the jewel in Zambia's crown. Any controlling shareholder is also likely to deem it prudent to have the government on board, if only to share responsibility for difficult decisions such as retrenchment. Although the government is unlikely to commit itself until after the World Bank study is completed, the chances of the privatisation being resolved within the next year must be good. The interim is likely to see a good deal of horse trading as private investors jockey for a piece of the action.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (1): Fresh start for Africa's newest democracy - While the government is bravely implementing radical reforms, more help is needed to combat a severe drought and to overcome the legacy of the Kaunda years 
text:  AFTER more than 25 debilitating years of mismanagement and regional wars, Zambia is making a fresh start. Peaceful elections in October 1991 marked the collapse of one party rule. A country once synonymous with African socialism has embarked on a reform programme as radical as any undertaken in Africa, which is being implemented at an unprecedented pace. Fourteen months after his overwhelming victory in Zambia's first multi-party elections in two decades, President Frederick Chiluba has won plaudits from donors and endorsements from the IMF and World Bank. Yet although aid and debt relief have been substantial Africa's newest democracy is under strain. The worst drought in living memory has contributed to a 10 per cent fall in gross domestic product fall. Government and private sector management is weak and daily depleted by Aids. Inflation is running at more than 100 per cent, on a year-on-year basis. Infrastructure is frail, social services are impoverished and industry needs re-equipping. Export receipts and aid flows may be enough for bare survival, but fall far short of what is needed for sustained recovery. Further painful reforms lie ahead and the impact on Zambia's social and political fabric will be severe. 'To make democracy work we need a sound economic base, and that we are unable to provide without more help,' said President Frederick Chiluba. Last October Mr Chiluba, a former trade unionist, led the Movement for a Multi-party Democracy to a sweeping victory. The MMD won 125 of the 150 National Assembly seats and Mr Chiluba secured 81 per cent of the presidential poll. For the first time since 1972, when Zambia became a one party state, the country had a choice. The electorate could hardly have been more emphatic in its rejection of the country's founding president, Mr Kenneth Kaunda and the United National Independence Party, in power since independence in 1964. In the weeks that followed the new government began tackling the legacy of Mr Kaunda. Executives of state owned corporations created under a late 1960s nationalisation programme were sacked. Subsidies were cut, the kwacha was soon to be further devalued, the agricultural marketing system liberalised. Fresh impetus was given to the privatisation of 130 state-owned companies including Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, responsible for more than 90 per cent of export earnings. It was as rude a shock as any African economy has experienced, but shock therapy was necessary, argued Mr Emmanuel Kasonde, the finance minister, when he delivered the MMD's first budget address in January. 'Our bitter experiences of the past have shown that piece-meal or half-hearted implementation of reform will get us no-where,' he told the National Assembly. The MMD inherited a disaster with roots that go back many years. When Zambia won independence from Britain in 1964 it had one of the highest per capita incomes of any black African state. By the time Mr Kaunda ceded power, Zambia had become - in per capita terms - one of the world's most indebted nations, its 8m people owing external creditors more than Dollars 7bn. Mr Kaunda's own inheritance was not easy. Zambia's colonial era ended with about 100 university graduates. From the start of independence, landlocked Zambia was in the front line of southern Africa's battles, at considerable cost: transport routes were disrupted, defence spending soared. To Mr Kaunda's credit, Zambia remained stable in a region at war, but far from resolving the problems he inherited, he compounded them, nationalising the country's two copper mines in the late 1960s, along with much of the rest of the economy. Agriculture suffered from too much state regulation and too little investment. Millions of kwacha were spent on white elephants, such as the Tika steel project. In 1975 came a blow from which Zambia has yet to recover. The price of copper, accounting for over 90 per cent of export earnings, plummeted for the second time in five years. By 1977 ZCCM's contribution to government revenue had fallen from nearly 55 per cent of the total to nil, while nearly two thirds of the foreign exchange earnings were taken up by the cost of production. The next 14 years saw a succession of failed recovery plans. The most serious obstacle to reform proved to be Mr Kaunda himself, reluctant to relinquish his socialist vision, presiding over a corrupt and authoritarian party. By 1990, when he buckled under domestic and international pressure and reluctantly accepted multiparty elections, Zambia's fortunes had reached their nadir. Most donors had frozen aid, arrears in repayment to the IMF had reached Dollars 1.2bn and the outgoing government had spent millions of kwachas of state money in an attempt to buy victory. The MMD, a broad coalition bringing together labour leaders, Unip defectors, prominent businessmen and a new generation of politicians and technocrats, has achieved much. Its efficient response to the drought has been widely praised. ZCCM output has risen under the new management, a markedly improved business environment is more conducive to foreign investment and the privatisation programme is proceeding apace. But long-suffering Zambians face more pain. The price of the staple food, maize, which has soared 500 per cent in real terms, rose again this month. Turning overstaffed state owned companies - notably Zambia Airways - into commercially viable organisations means more job losses. Cutting inflation - the aim is an annualised rate of 20 per cent by end-93 - requires further spending cuts and reductions in the civil service. In last month's local government elections the MMD won a comfortable victory but the percentage turn-out barely reached double figures, reflecting the weakness of the opposition rather than a mandate for the MMD, whose honeymoon with the electorate is over. A flawed constitution inherited from Mr Kaunda, now under review, encourages an authoritarian streak in some ministers. It allows bans on freedom of assembly and fails to guarantee press freedom. Nor has the MMD's status been enhanced by national assembly members' decision to award themselves tax-free salaries of Dollars 1,000 a month. All this not only angers Zambians, it also undermines Mr Chiluba's plea for further assistance to help democracy take root. Yet for all the shortcomings, Mr Chiluba leads what is 'probably one of the most modern, open and forward-looking governments on the continent,' says Mr Mike Hall, editor of the Weekly Post. This new dimension to Zambia's leadership offers hope for the country's future, tempered by the conclusion of a 1989 World Bank paper analysing Zambia's record: 'When reform efforts finally got into high gear, the initial position was one of acute disequilibrium. The economy had no cushion and no safety net. Successful reform under these circumstances required nearly perfect foresight, technically valid policy packages, strong political commitment, uninterrupted implementation and good luck.' This might yet serve as warning that unless Zambia can rely on donors for further expertise and additional resources. President Chiluba warns: 'If we lose this opportunity, I see no way out of the quagmire.'

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hillsdown sees heavy trading 
text:  SHARES in Hillsdown Holdings were the most heavily traded in the London market yesterday as the company announced a boardroom shuffle which included the replacement of Sir Harry Solomon, the chairman. A maintained dividend was also pledged. The shares, which have surged in recent days, rose 8 to 130p in heavy turnover of 23m. Analysts heralded the board changes as a possible turning point in the company's fortunes, with the new chairman expected to hasten Hillsdown's restructuring programme andconcentrate on its core food manufacturing. Among the disposals already being hinted at in the market yesterday was the sale of Hillsdown's furniture business, with Silentnight rumoured as a potential buyer. However, in the short term many observers see Hillsdown continuing to struggle to improve earnings. Mr Carl Short at Nomura commented: 'Hillsdown needs pruning back, but it will be a long and difficult task. There is unlikely to be any impact on the business from the new management until 1994.' He predicted a 26 per cent drop in earnings per share this year, following falls of some 15 per cent in both 1990 and 1991. GEC in demand Aggressive buying by Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL), the French-owned stockbroker, was said to have been res-ponsible for the strong performance by GEC late on Tuesday and throughout yesterday. CLL moved into the market after what was described as a 'very positive' meeting on Tuesday with Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, Mr David Newlands, the group's finance director, and CLL's institutional clients. Mr Mike Styles, an electronics specialist at CLL, said the GEC directors had detailed the company's strengths, highlighting the success of the Alsthom joint venture, the group's dividend growth policy, strong cash position and the impressive balance sheet. 'If you do not believe the UK recovery story, then look no further than GEC,' said Mr Styles. GEC shares moved up 7 to 269p on volume of 5.6m. RMC flurry Suggestions that Cazenove, RMC's stockbroker, had hoisted its current year profits forecast for the aggregates group and promoted some keen buying interest in the stock was the prime motivation behind a strong performance for RMC shares, finally 15 ahead at 542p. Dealers said the initial flurry of buying had uncovered 'a horrible shortage of stock', and led dealers to mark the shares sharply higher. Building specialists said Cazenove had increased its earnings estimate from Pounds 140m to Pounds 152m, although this was not confirmed by Cazenove, which never discusses its market operations with the press. The general consensus for RMC's 1992 earnings ranges from around Pounds 140m to Pounds 155m. RMC shares have substantially outperformed the Footsie index in recent months. Since early October, the shares have risen more than 40 per cent while the Footsie has moved up around 10 per cent. Owners applause Tour operator Owners Abroad won applause for the deal struck with LTU, the German holiday group which earlier this year bought the Thomas Cook travel agent chain. Analysts said the agreement, in which Owners and Thomas Cook took a 10 per cent cross-holding, would benefit the UK operator financially and strategically. Among the many upgrades, Smith New Court raised this year's forecast by Pounds 4m to Pounds 38m. Paribas moved to a buy, arguing the deal would not only ensure Owners' dominant presence as the UK's second largest tour group, but also that it still did not rule out a bid from rival Airtours. However, others in the market, who had climbed aboard in the hope of an Airtours bid, felt otherwise and baled out. After dropping sharply, the shares recovered to close a penny down at 87p in turnover of 4m. Airtours was ahead by the same amount at 264p. Stocks with a perceived international exposure were helped by the steady flow of encouraging economic pointers from the US. ICI improved 11 to 1033p and BOC saw good two-way business and was bought up to 762p to leave a net advance of 14 on good turnover of 1.1m. Reuters improved 13 to 1346p. A unit of Reuters announced that it had bought new securities lending software from two UK-based companies for an undisclosed sum. The recent oil/gas discovery off the coast of Burmah made by Premier Consolidated continued to drive the latter's shares higher; they closed 3 firmer at 21p on keen turnover of 6.9m. At least three of the leading UK building materials companies, Blue Circle, Tarmac and Pilkington were being touted as potential bid targets by market operators yesterday. A late bout of bid speculation saw all three share prices move ahead. The heaviest trading was in Pilkington, the troubled glass manufacturer, which last week raided its reserves to pay a maintained interim dividend. Pilkington settled 5 up at 90p on turnover of 5.9m. Tarmac, also among the market's bid favourites in recent months, moved up 6 1/2 to 106p with 5.4m shares traded. Blue Circle put on 3 at 178p on 1.8m. Tate &amp; Lyle improved as the market dwelt further on the impact of the new sweetener deal being negotiated with PepsiCo. However, observers pointed out that Tate had been optimistic on the subject for several weeks and most of the upside was already in the shares. They moved 1 1/2 higher to 399p. Some media stocks took heart from research on advertising prospects. Analysts said one survey, emanating from the US PaineWebber media conference, was predicting US advertising growth next year of between 0.2 per cent and 3.7 per cent. Pearson, which has significant exposure to the US, rose 10 to 391p as marketmakers found themselves short of stock. However, Reed International, seen as overvalued, eased a penny to 632p. Media-buying company Aegis fell 3 to 17p after the group announced more restructuring and Pounds 20m in exceptional costs. The company said trading conditions were expected to remain difficult in the main European markets. The Daily Telegraph exceeded its issue price for the first time yesterday. The shares were floated at 325p in June but began trading around the 290p level. Yesterday, the stock climbed 8 to 330p. Mirror Group remained firm, closing 3 1/2 stronger at 89 1/2 p, helped by some talk that the administrators were considering placing part of their stake at 125p. Specialist chemicals manufacturer MTM was the principal casualty in the London stock market yesterday. The shares halved in value after the group announced the need for further provisions because of poor trading. MTM said: 'The continuing high level of debt and associated interest payable, as well as the exceptional fees being incurred has negated any short term financial progress being made. The decline in the pound/dollar exchange rate has increased the group's sterling obligations. MTM shares closed 16 lower at 15p. A stock overhang was responsible for the decline in Associated British Ports. The stock gave up 7 to 341p. Shares in Alvis jumped 5 to 19p after the results. Among aerospace stocks, the news that the Airbus consortium had won an order for 28 aircraft from ILFC led to strong demand for British Aerospace. The shares jumped 7 to 147p in heavy trade of 8.3m. Strong demand for Rolls-Royce after it said it would supply Dollars 160m of engines to power ILFC aircraft was tempered by dividend worries The shares closed 5 1/2 higher at 109 1/2 p. Optimism in the sector also boosted Smiths Industries and the stock firmed 4 to 352p. Smith New Court, however, remains cautious. Two trades totalling 15.4m shares in BET were executed at 75p, apparently an overnight tax-related deal. BET closed unchanged at 83p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (56).

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Good advance as confidence returns 
text:  RENEWED demand for UK equities reversed the traditional pattern yesterday by spreading from the second line stocks and boosting the FT-SE listed blue chips. Disappointing November statistics on domestic retail sales and Public Sector Borrowing Requirement failed to restrain investors' optimism and London responded favourably to the latest data on the US economy. Trading volume increased briskly and a scattering of bid stories, albeit featuring many old favourities, underscored the note of optimism. Two trading programmes were identified, spread across the full range of the market. Activity in stock index futures ahead of Friday's expiry deadline again buttressed the underlying equity market, although there was less arbitraging between futures and equities than in the previous session. After drifting lower at first to touch 2,713.1, the Footsie turned higher, attracting some genuine buying interest rather than the merely futures-related demand seen earlier this week. The market climbed steadily throughout the session, closing just below the day's best to record a final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,732.8, a net gain of 14.9. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index remained very positive, ending with a further advance of 18.4 on the day. Volume in second line stocks well outpaced that of the Footsie-listed issues and the day's total of Seaq-reported business rose to 676.3m shares from the 551.6m of the previous day. Retail business on Tuesday was worth Pounds 1.15bn, regaining the higher levels briefly lost on Monday. Equity strategists at County NatWest drew attention to the substantial recovery in share trading which, they claim, has brought the most active year since 1987, the annus horribilis of the stock market. County comments that average daily turnover of more than Pounds 1bn this year compares with Pounds 912m in 1991. The news that UK retail sales dipped by 0.1 per cent last month was slightly disappointing for the stores sector, where a rise of about the same proportions had been expected. But the reaction in share prices was calm, with most of the store leaders closing a shade higher. Analysts are focusing on the prospects for the Christmas selling season. With the bad news from IBM offset by better reports yesterday on US housing starts and industrial production, London continued to look for an early improvement in the economy across the Atlantic. UK investors were unabashed by a slow start to the new session on Wall Street, which was a shade off in London trading hours. In spite of the upturn in equities, traders remained cautious ahead of the year-end, for which many securities analysts are still predicting a Footsie close of 2,700. Yesterday's buyers appeared to be focusing on stocks which have been under downward pressure recently. Some drinks shares staged a recovery from the upset prompted last week by downgradings on Guinness. Banking issues found support. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, predicted a good rally in UK equities next month, when it believes that attention may return to the cyclical sectors, such as building materials, chemicals, metals, packaging and paper. January rallies, said Goldman, often reflect window-dressing by fund managers, or just investor psychology.

text:  ROLLING forward of positions from the December contract into March was the main feature in stock index futures, although buying from a large US house helped to boost turnover, writes Joel Kibazo. After opening at 2,720, selling of the December contract on the FT-SE by independent traders led it to fall to 2,715 within the first hour of trading. Dealers, however, appeared to have been caught short, and together with good buying said to have come from one US house, December recovered to move forward for the rest of the session. The release of disappointing retail sales figures for November had little effect and instead led to some renewed speculation of a cut in interest rates. With only two full days to go before the expiry of the December contract, trading was again featured by extensive switching into the March version. December finished at 2,740, up 20 from the previous close and at a 9-point premium to the underlying cash market. Turnover in the December contract was 7,746 lots, while that in March reached 4,793. Volume in the traded options returned to more modest levels. Total turnover came to 29,456 lots, of which 9,339 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. Asda was the busiest stock option with turnover of 6,252 contracts. It was followed by Rolls-Royce on 1,470 and Ladbroke on 1,346.

text:  A LOWER futures market prompted profit-taking by dealers and investment trusts, wiping out share price gains from a morning rally, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average was finally down 212.03 at 17,268.71 after a day's high of 17,601.20 and low of 17,266.40. The index was bolstered in the morning by reports of tax measures to reinvigorate the real estate sector, and depressed by selling in the late afternoon. Volume rose to 250m shares from 213m. Declines led advances by 639 to 351, with 149 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 8.57 to 1,317.33. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.99 to 1,069.91. Most of the activity was futures led yesterday, hence the predominance in trading of investment trusts and dealers. Reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had prepared a final proposal on reviving tax breaks for those who renew housing, and that it had reviewed the possible abolition of the land tax system, excited some traders, but most investors remained on the sidelines. Brokers actively traded issues with large latent assets on rumours that financial authorities are minded to allow banks and companies to revalue assets and count any surplus as capital. Most analysts were sceptical over the implementation of such book-keeping measures. Mr Alex Kinmont, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: 'They would only be exchanging one fictional value for another,' referring to the lack of qualified land surveyors. Nippon Express, which was initially bought on the asset revaluation theme, lost Y4 on balance at Y760, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y5,000 to Y549,000. Keisei Electric Railway appreciated Y7 to Y827. Real estate companies rose on news of possible land tax reforms. Mitsui Fudosan put on Y30 to Y1,030 and Mitsubishi Estate Y30 to Y935. Further rumours of a takeover by Harrods pushed Yokohama Matsuzakaya up Y99 to Y639, the largest percentage gain of the day. Nagase, a trading company, advanced Y40 to Y745 on hopes of brisk sales of its antibacterial cloth. High-technology issues lost ground on profit-taking by investment trusts. Hitachi slipped Y2 to Y743 and Fujitsu retreated Y17 to Y557. However, Hitachi Electronics climbed Y40 to Y1,420 on firm earnings projections. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 54.78 to 18,839.62. Large lot cross-trading, or realising profits on long-term holdings without changing underlying portfolios, boosted volume to 117.9m shares, against 21.1m. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y100 to Y11,000 on profit-taking. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets continued to be mixed, with domestic issues predominant. HONG KONG strengthened in the afternoon session as some confidence returned to the market following recent nervousness over political relations with China. The Hang Seng index rose 100.15, or 1.9 per cent, to 5,415.96 in turnover of HKDollars 2.4bn. Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia gained as some investors switched out of HSBC Holdings on reports that it might have to make new debt provisions. Hang Seng Bank was up HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 51.50 while Bank of East Asia gained HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 33. HSBC closed unchanged at HKDollars 55.50, after a day's low of HKDollars 54.50. SEOUL advanced slightly with interest in Daewoo group stocks on news that Daewoo Corp had won a Dollars 280m construction order from Malaysia. The composite index rose 3.88 to 654.09 and Daewoo Corp added Won500 at Won11,700. TAIWAN remained weak in cautious trading ahead of Saturday's parliamentary elections. The weighted index closed 13.34 lower at 3,674.92 in turnover down to TDollars 6.6bn from TDollars 7.2bn. MANILA was helped higher by the recovery of Philippine Long Distance Telephone in New York. The composite index improved 39.42 to 1,222.91 in combined turnover of 679.5m pesos. PLDT rallied 30 pesos to 840 pesos, while Philippine National Bank advanced 14 pesos to 220 pesos SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index moved ahead 14.52 to 1,456.62 in turnover of some SDollars 252m. Cycle and Carriage, up 10 cents at SDollars 6.50, led the market: Jardine Strategic Holdings, of Hong Kong, said it had bought a 16 per cent stake in the car distributor. In KUALA LUMPUR the composite index ended 4.01 up at 632.89 with Multi-Purpose gaining 2 cents at MDollars 2.21. AUSTRALIA weakened on profit-taking, the All Ordinaries index closing 12.6 off at 1,497.0 in turnover of ADollars 260.15m. News Corp was among the day's biggest losers, following a downgrading by a US broker, and the shares ended 82 cents cheaper at ADollars 29. Banks remained under pressure, with National Australia falling 17 cents to ADollars 7.53, ANZ 5 cents to ADollars 2.68 and Westpac 3 cents to ADollars 3.03.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program trading sharply weakens Dow 
text:  Wall Street US SHARE prices fell sharply yesterday afternoon as program trading combined with a second day of strong selling of IBM stock, and also the erosion of Goodyear's share price, to drive the market lower, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator dropped 29.18 to 3,255.18 after spending most of the day only modestly lower. New York SE volume was heavy with 244m shares changing hands. Falls outscored rises by 1,041 to 726. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, however, eased only 1.05 to 431.52 and the Nasdaq composite dipped 1.12 to 649.63. There was little reaction to the day's economic news, that housing starts were 1.5 per cent higher in November. Although the gain was stronger than expected it was consistent with a picture of a gradually improving US economy. The October report was revised to show a gain of 0.2 per cent from a previously reported decline of 1.1 per cent. IBM continued its downward spiral, tumbling Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 51 7/8 after dropping Dollars 6 3/4 a day earlier. Investors started to flee from IBM, one of the market's biggest stocks, after the company said on Tuesday that it was cutting 25,000 jobs and taking a Dollars 6bn restructuring charge. In the technology sector, Compaq improved Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 43, regaining its previous day's loss. Motorola added Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 101 1/2 , but Digital Equipment shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 . Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 66 1/2 after the stock was downgraded by Merrill Lynch, reflecting concern that European and Latin American currency fluctuations would hurt the company's fourth-quarter earnings. American Cyanamid lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 on news that it had agreed to buy a 53.5 per cent stake in Immunex by contributing Dollars 350m towards the creation of a new biopharmaceutical company. Immunex put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 46 1/4 on the Nasdaq. Safety-Kleen, a hazardous waste recycler, plunged Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 in heavy trading on disappointing fourth-quarter earnings projections. The company said that it expects to post profits of Dollars 12.5m in the quarter after a charge of Dollars 1.3m. In the 1991 fourth quarter Safety-Kleen earned Dollars 13.9m. In contrast, Intel soared Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 83 1/2 , above its previous 52-week high of Dollars 80 1/2 , on strong fourth-quarter earnings predictions. The integrated-circuit maker expects the quarter's earnings to be well above analysts' expectations, thanks to high demand for its Intel 486 microprocessors. Canada THE Toronto market ended sharply firmer after a round of prime lending rate cuts of a quarter-point, a rise in bullion prices and a positive report by the OECD fuelled a rally, which came in spite of the setback on Wall Street. The TSE 300 Index advanced 31.5 to 3,296.1 and rises led declines by 360 to 310. Volume was again heavy, totalling 43.5m shares, after Tuesday's 52.7m. The gold and silver index climbed 146.3 to 5,293.4, led by American Barrick, CDollars  7/8 higher at CDollars 38 5/8 . Comex gold futures ended USDollars 3.40 up at USDollars 338.70.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Bombay suffers as violence hits the city - Political problems weigh on the equity markets 
text:  Bombay has this week slowly limped back to commercial life, following the violence which hit the city after the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya. But it will take much longer to restore confidence in the nervous financial markets. Shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange, which was closed for three days after the mosque's demolition unleashed a nationwide wave of unrest, have fallen since trading resumed to 8.8 per cent below pre-crisis levels. Yesterday the exchange's index of 30 leading stocks dropped 102 points to 2,374.72, pushed down by news of the imposition of central government rule in three states. The stock exchange authorities have tried to slow the decline by tightening limits on trading volumes, but with little effect on sentiment. Brokers said yesterday that the uncertainty would persist until Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao restored political stability. Doubts about the future course of the economy are expected to cloud the financial outlook until the government announces the next phase of its economic reform programme in the budget due in February. Financial companies are also still suffering from the effect of the Rs35bn (Dollars 1.35bn) securities market scandal, which has depressed activity in almost all markets, including stocks. Mr Hemendra Kothari, chairman of DSP Financial and Investment Services, a leading broker, said: 'I personally feel the political situation will clear sooner rather than later, though how long it will take is anybody's guess.' Mr Kothari, a former stock exchange president, added that stocks could fall further as investors were waiting for the budget to get a correct picture of economic reforms, although mid-January might be a good time for bargain hunting. The crisis has severely dampened activity in the burgeoning market in primary issues. Hindustan Aluminium Company, a leading aluminium maker, last week postponed the pricing of a planned Dollars 100m euro-equity issue. Investment bankers in Bombay said the issue would probably now be postponed until after the budget is published on February 28. Other proposed issues, including Essar Gujarat, which is raising funds for a sponge iron plant, could also be delayed, they said. Indian brokers have also become wary of marketing local share issues for fear that the decline in share prices is squeezing investors' resources. Yet the market is not entirely dead: private individuals have, for example, flocked to buy stock in Wockhardt, a Bombay pharmaceutical maker. The political upheaval over Ayodhya will delay investments by foreign fund managers. Foreigners this autumn won permission to invest directly in India's equity market, albeit on strict conditions. But so far only eight out of 19 applicants have been approved. Many of the remaining 11 institutions are fund management groups linked to security broking companies, and have been held up by delays over deciding the terms of entry for foreign securities companies. One foreign banker in Delhi said that even before the Ayodhya crisis foreigners had been in no hurry to invest in India. Apart from the Ayodhya crisis and the financial scandal, foreigners are concerned about the relatively high valuation of Indian stocks. The top 30 shares trade on price/earnings multiples of about 32. As a result, Indian brokers believe that the country will see an inflow of portfolio investment funds of a bare Dollars 100m in the financial year to March, compared with an original unofficial target of Dollars 1bn. Similarly, Indian companies are now expected to raise only about Dollars 500m to Dollars 600m in Euro-equity issues, just over half the Dollars 1bn originally expected. Meanwhile, the stock exchange authorities are concerned that the political crisis may yet bring further trouble on the broking community by driving some broking firms into financial collapse. The industry, which enjoyed an unprecedented boom until April, has since seen prices and trading volumes fall sharply, causing financial problems at many small broking concerns.

text:  Individual stocks featured in senior bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT continued its painful revision of carmakers' prospective earnings and dividends, and current market ratings. Volkswagen fell DM9 to DM235.50, and Daimler DM6.40 to DM506.60 as the DAX index closed a relatively modest 9.17 lower at 1,472.07. Turnover eased to DM3.5bn from DM3.7m, VW trading in DM225m after DM125m as it talked of substantial fourth quarter losses, effectively confirmed that it will cut this year's dividend and indicated that 1993 could be a good deal worse. Mr Bob Barber, who heads the automotive and capital goods team at James Capel, said that he now expected earnings per share from VW of only DM9 against DM36 in 1991, and forecast a DM400m loss for 1993, with the dividend falling from DM11, through DM6 for this year to DM4. PARIS weakened late in the session on news that Societe Generale was to increase its base rate to 10 per cent from 9.45 per cent from today. The bank said that the increase followed the recent rise in money market rates because of the franc's weakness in the last few weeks. The CAC-40 index closed down 8.10 at 1,736.69, off the day's high of 1,757.45, in turnover of some FFr2.7bn. Societe Generale rose FFr5 on the news to FFr578 while Paribas recovered some of its losses to end down 80 centimes at FFr333. Suez closed down FFr2.50 at FFr231.50. Peugeot dipped FFr5 to FFr555 after the group forecast a 4 per cent fall in European car sales, and Volkswagen warned of larger-than-expected fourth quarter losses. MILAN reversed weakness earlier this week in privatisation stocks, BCI recovering L145 to L4,179, Credito Italiano L224 to L2,735 and Nuovo Pignone L250 to L4,520, the last two strengthening further to L2,875 and L4,620 respectively on the kerb. The Comit index, however, rose only 2.07 to 406.32 amid political nervousness generated by the Craxi affair and the ruling parties' rebuff in local elections. Rinascente soared, closing with a session gain of L685 or 11 per cent to L7,025, and to L7,200 after hours. The Fiat group retailer has been at centre of speculation about a possible sale for some time. ZURICH's SMI index rose nearly 1 per cent, closing 18.8 higher at 2,023.9 in moderate volume. Dealers said that window-dressing of year-end accounts by some brokers was behind some of the day's late buying. BRUSSELS saw some gains in the financial sector with SGB putting on BFr15 to BFr1,810. The Bel-20 index gained 5.22 to 1,106.35. Petrofina, which suffered a 6 per cent fall on Tuesday after announcing that it would cut its dividend 50 per cent, fell a further BFr50 to BFr7,440. Solvay bucked the trend with a gain of BFr150 to BFr11,200. STOCKHOLM saw Astra weakening further following a disappointing analysts' meeting earlier in the week. The Affarsvarlden index shed 14.35 to 864.75 with Astra free shares slipping SKr21 to SKr711. OSLO continued to weaken as high interest rates depressed sentiment. The all share index fell 4.57 to 372.08 in turnover of NKr202m. Among actives Kvaerner A shares lost NKr1 to NKr147, Bergesen A fell NKr3 to NKr98, and Elkem slid NKr3 to NKr28. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency Index closed 0.4 lower at 103.1. ING put on 50 cents to Fl 53.50 with overseas interest being seen. Elsewhere in the financial sector Aegon fell 80 cents to Fl 72.70 and Amev lost 50 cents to Fl 58.30. VIENNA lost ground after Creditanstalt announced that it planned to cut its 1992 dividend to 6 per cent from 15 per cent in 1991. The ATX index closed down 13.04 or 1.7 per cent at 738.77 while Creditanstalt preferred shares fell Sch14 to Sch421.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- December 16                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open         10.30        11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1032.57       1033.48      1033.41     1035.18 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1111.83       1111.37      1112.53     1113.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00         14.00        15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1035.66       1036.52      1038.11     1036.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1114.79       1114.78      1118.33     1117.67  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 15    Dec 14    Dec 11    Dec 10     Dec 9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.14   1041.18   1044.03   1049.63   1054.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1115.23   1116.33   1117.72   1123.58   1133.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1038.94; 200 - 1118.33 Low/day: 100 - 1032.47 200 - 1110.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Money Markets: French rate rise 
text:  FRANCE'S national banks raised their main lending rates yesterday, amid worsening sentiment towards the French franc on financial markets, writes James Blitz. The leading state-owned banks said they were increasing French base lending rates to 10 per cent from 9.45 per cent. The move is effective from today, and came in the wake of the recent sharp rises in money market rates. In the German cash market, call money eased slightly to around 8.95 per cent as market activity normalised in the wake of the Bundesbank's securities repurchase tender. However, sentiment persists that the Bundesbank is unlikely to reduce its official rates until well into the spring, a factor which will continue to keep pressure on the French franc high. The rise in French base rates followed this week's rise in cash market rates, which commercial banks have found incompatible with the rate structure in the retail sector. French three-month money climbed again yesterday, to 11 1/2 per cent from a previous close of 11 3/8 per cent. French franc futures fell back again: the March contract was down 15 basis points at a close of 90.40. Miss Joanne Perez, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, said the decision to lift base rates reflected general disappointment in France's banking sector that there was no reduction in German official rates last week. Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets in London, suggested that French monetary policy may have to be tightened even further today. She believes that the Bank of France will be forced to raise the rate in the 5 to 10-day lending window today in order to support the franc. One reason for this is that French call money, which closed yesterday at around 9 15/16 per cent, is virtually touching the current 5 to 10-day lending rate of 10 per cent. Miss Cottrell also said that the Bundesbank has sent strong signals in recent weeks that it will be prepared to defend the franc only if the French central bank plays by the rules of the European exchange rate mechanism. 'The message being sent to the French is that if they want the Bundesbank to come into the market and intervene to support the franc, they must first show a willingness to raise rates,' she said.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Prospects for franc deteriorate 
text:  THE FRENCH franc remained under considerable pressure against the D-Mark yesterday, as foreign exchange dealers took a more pessimistic view of the prospects of the currency avoiding devaluation, writes James Blitz. The currency markets were again the scene of the thin trading associated with the Christmas period. The dollar, for example, lost more than a pfennig against the D-Mark, finishing at DM1.5550, as a handful of players had a big impact on the leading exchange rates. The US unit improved a little in New York to end at DM1.5570. Trading in the D-Mark cross rates remained jittery. The yen, French franc and Italian lira were all sold at one time or another against the German currency, and dealers continued to take the view that the Bundesbank will not lower interest rates in a hurry. By far the biggest problems confronted the franc. Although trading was quiet in the European morning, the French currency came under renewed pressure after France's leading state-owned banks responded to recent rises in money market rates by lifting their base rates by 25 basis points. The currency was also besieged by rumours that the news conference to be held today by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, will be the stage for a dramatic announcement. Among the subjects rumoured to be on the agenda were the resignation of Mr Beregovoy, the resignation of Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, and a rise in French official rates. None of these rumours could be confirmed. The franc was unchanged at FFr3.4170 against the D-Mark at the end of European trading. But in US trading it fell further, to below FFr3.42. Another factor worrying dealers was that the franc fell to 77 percentage points on the ERM divergence indicator. Under the Basle-Nyborg agreement, it is presumed that a central bank must defend its currency either by inter-vention or by increasing int-erest rates if it falls below the 75 percentage-point level. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, believes there has been a striking deterioration in sentiment over the French currency in recent days. He thinks that the currency remains strong on fundamental economic grounds. 'But it will be very difficult for the franc to survive without a devaluation, either in this calendar year or the next,' he said. Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, believes France must now tighten monetary policy to show its willingness to defend the currency. 'The lesson of sterling's devaluation is that if a central bank does not defend its currency promptly, devaluation is unavoidable,' he said. Yesterday's dollar fall was due to technical factors alone. US industrial production in November rose by 0.4 per cent, exactly in line with forecasts.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelters feel 'green' squeeze 
text:  ENVIRONMENTAL pressures are causing a structural change in the metals smelting industry - particularly in copper and zinc smelting - that will force smelters to raise prices charged to the mining industry by 20 to 25 per cent, according to Mr Thomas Baack, chief economist at Metallgesellschaft, the German metals and mining group. He suggests that in the short term copper miners can afford to absorb the increase in smelter treatment charges but this is not the case for the zinc miners. And, 'in the medium to longer term, the higher processing costs will have to be reflected in (metal) prices,' warns Mr Baack. He says, in MG's latest metals markets survey, that smelters are suffering 'irreversible' changes to their revenues and costs, changes directly or indirectly related to pollution control measures. To comply with present standards, smelters need to spend up to a third of their capital investment and operating costs on control measures, he points out. At the same time, some revenue-producing by-products of the smelting process, such as sulphuric acid and cadmium, are threatened by present environmental trends. Smelters, forced to capture more sulphur from ores, are producing much more sulphuric acid, yet demand for the acid has fallen - also because of environmental factors. Mr Baack says it is possible that before long smelters will have to pay heavily to dispose of sulphuric acid. He points out that the price of cadmium has also fallen so low that it is hardly worth recovering during zinc smelting. 'Since the use of cadmium is being further restricted because of its toxicity, it is unlikely that the market will recover,' Mr Baack adds. 'As a consequence of this development, higher smelting charges are unavoidable. . . Surcharges of between 20 and 25 per cent can be reckoned on.'

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC ministers strive to tie up farm reform package 
text:  EUROPEAN COMMUNITY agriculture ministers were striving last night to tie up a package of 'loose-ends' from this year's reform of the common agricultural policy, combined with a series of measures which have to be in place for the internal market starting on January 1. The complex, end-of-year compromise package - which in parts reads like a letter to Santa Claus from ministers seeking presents for farmers unhappy about CAP reform and cuts being agreed under the Uruguay Round world trade reform - was last night the subject of intense bilateral negotiations between the member states, and the European Commission and current UK presidency of the EC. Decisions looked unlikely until today at the earliest, but two developments may inject some urgency into the farm ministers' habitually drawn-out horse-trading. According to senior commission officials, proposals on banana tariffs, the 'green currency' regime, and compensation to Spain and Portugal for giving up transitional protection they won for their farmers when they joined the EC in 1986, could be put to other ministers for decision if the farm council procrastinates further. The 12 meet today to finalise Single Market rules, and on Monday EC foreign ministers are due to meet. In this extreme case, the extensive list of unsettled national demands - seen by some agriculture ministers as a vital sop to farmers for accepting internal and internationally agreed cutbacks on price, output and exports - would be put aside and lose purchase on future negotiations. Second, the undertakings the EC agreed last month with the US within the farm trade chapter of the Uruguay Round were yesterday handed in to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva. France had on Tuesday made a further attempt to hold up the Geneva negotiations to conclude the Uruguay Round, and its failure was underlined by delivery of these 'schedules'. The Uruguay Round talks in the 14 other trade sectors earmarked for liberalisation are now expected to gather momentum, locking in the farm deal. Moreover, senior EC officials say there is an emerging majority behind the EC-US farm trade deal. They say that more than half the 12 are willing to defend it, lest the EC be forced into further concessions by the other 95 signatories to the Gatt. Among the most problematic issues in dispute last night was bananas. A common regime on bananas is required to complete the single market. But Gatt also requires that the EC replaces blanket protection for banana growers in outlying community territories and former European colonies by tariffs. The commission originally wanted to put a quota on far cheaper Central American, or 'dollar' bananas, to protect these growers. The 'dollar' zone already supplies 60 per cent of the 3.4m tonnes of the fruit consumed in the EC, and too free a market would wipe out high-cost EC suppliers from the Canary Islands to the Caribbean. The compromise fixes a 1.9m tonnes annual quota for the Latin suppliers, with a 20 per cent tariff of Ecu100 per tonne. Above this quota - part of which they would have to share with EC suppliers - they would have to pay an Ecu700 (Pounds 560) tariff per tonne. The 12 were polarised last night between France, which wants the low tariff quota limited to 1.4m tonnes with an Ecu800 surcharge on each extra tonne, and Germany, the EC's main banana consumer, almost entirely from the dollar area, which was holding out for a 2.4m tonnes annual quota, with a maximum tariff of Ecu250 on additional imports.

text:  MOROCCO'S OUTPUT of non-ferrous metals is being doubled with the opening of the Guemassa zinc-lead-copper mine, 35 km (22 miles) due south of Marrakesh. Guemassa, Morocco's largest mine, is a joint venture between the privately-owned Omnium Nord Africain and the state-controlled Bureau de Recherches et de Participation Miniere. The mine has reserves estimated at 12m tonnes and production is forecast to run at a rate of 750,000 tonnes of ore a year, giving a 16-year mine life. It is scheduled to produce annually concentrate (an intermediate product) containing about 67,600 tonnes of zinc, 19,200 tonnes of lead and 3,000 tonnes of copper. Most of the output will be exported to Europe, particularly to Spain. The Guemassa mine ranks as one of the ten largest zinc mines in the world and the second largest in the European and Mediterranean region after the Tara mine in Ireland. ONA has invested Dirhams 850m (Pounds 70m) in the project, Dh520m from its own reserves. The annual turnover of ONA, whose activities include tourism, food processing, distribution, banking and real estate, amounted to Dh14.2bn last year, Dh600m coming from mining, which is concentrated in three areas. They include mining precious metals and copper oxide in the Anti- Atlas, polymetallic ores and precious metals in the Maroc-Central region, as well as Guemassa.

text:  THE SEPTEMBER rains had left enough moisture in the subsoil to allow India to produce up to 11m tonnes of oilseeds during the winter, according to government figures. With the summer harvest estimated to have reached 10.9m tonnes that means total production for the 1992-93 season is likely to be nearly 3m tonnes above target at a record 21.9m tonnes, compared with 19.5m tonnes last year. The summer crop estimate comprises 5.7m tonnes of groundnuts, and 2.9m of soyabeans, as well as 700,000 tonnes of sunflowerseed, 700,000 tonnes of castor seed and 200,000 tonnes of niger. The technology mission on oilseeds, set up by the federal government six years ago to reduce the country's dependence on vegeteable oil imports, has been making efforts to promote oilseeds cultivation on scientific lines and the country has succeeded in bringing more and more land under oilseeds by giving good returns to the farmers. But productivity of about 800 kg a hectare is among the lowest in the world. According to government officials, the main reason for the low productivity is the limited use of hybrid seeds.

text:  INDIAN COTTON prices are much lower than last year's, in spite of the federal government raising support prices and sanctioning an export quota of 500,000 bales (170 kg each) of cotton, plus 85,100 bales of yellow pickings and soft and hard cotton waste, ahead of the arrival of the new season crop. The delayed monsoon has ensured that this year's cotton crop will be late and crop arrivals are just begining to pick up momentum. Last year, however, cotton prices were too high, which restricted mill offtake to 10.3m bales. So the 1992-93 season opened in September with very comfortable stocks of nearly 3.3m bales. The behaviour of cotton prices has once again proved that India cannot depend entirely upon value-added exports of yarn and fabrics. The interest of farmers in cotton cultivation is unlikely to be sustained unless India remains a regular exporter of cotton. In fact, the government may allow further exports of cotton in the current season to maintain domestic prices. Mill offtake is also likely to rise to 11m bales. Estimates of this year's cotton crop vary between the ministry of agriculture's 11.51m bales and the East India Cotton Association's 12.8m-13.6m bales. The Cotton Corporation of India puts the figure at 13m bales. Based on these projections, the Cotton Advisory Board has settled on a range of 12m to 12.5m bales, up from 11.9m bales last year. As the season progresses, however, the crop estimate may be revised, as had always been the case in the past.

At the London Metal Exchange attention was focussed on ALUMINIUM prices, which rose to the highest level since September. Traders said the rise, which left the three months delivery position Dollars 16 higher on the day at Dollars 1,240.50 a tonne, was instigated by an early burst of commission house buying, possibly against options. US buyers joined in after lunch they added. The ZINC market took heart from the firmer aluminium price and mixed buying and short covering lifted the three months price by Dollars 11.50 to Dollars 1,078 a tonne. Crude OIL prices moved higher after the president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries said he thought the recent slide was bottoming out. Compiled from Reuters

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Progress seen in world settlement systems says G30 
text:  THE settlement systems of stock markets around the world have come a long way since the 1987 crash first provoked concern about their effectiveness, according to a report issued yesterday by the Group of 30, the Washington-based think tank. However, ambitious targets for the standardisation of settlement arrangements, set by G30 and due to be completed by the end of this year, have still not been met by many leading financial centres. It was in March 1989 that a G30 steering committee, led by Mr John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, set its far-reaching targets. These included recommendations that all trades should be settled three days after they have taken place (known in the jargon as T+3), that each country should have a central securities depositary and that settlement systems should achieve delivery-versus-payment (DVP) - that is, stocks and cash should be transferred simultaneously. A target date of the end of 1992 was set for all three of these recommendations. So far, though, they have been met in full by only a handful of investment centres. Of 34 countries reporting in G30's latest annual survey of international settlement arrangements, for example, 10 have achieved T+3 or are in the process of changing to such a system, while nine are on shorter settlement cycles. Attainment of other targets is more difficult to establish. Most countries claim to have achieved DVP, though this may not mean that cash and shares are transferred free of any claim or recourse. 'Against that stern test, quite a lot will fail,' says Mr David Holland, consultant to the G30 settlement initiative. The group's latest status reports on settlement systems reveal both the advances that have been made in a number of countries this year, as well as some of the weaknesses that still exist. France and Sweden, for example, have both made the move to T+3, while Hong Kong has launched a centralised securities depositary based on book-entry transfer. The UK remains among those that are further behind, though its planned paperless settlement system, Taurus, is tipped to be completed next year. The London stock exchange said yesterday that 100 listed companies had passed the amendments to their articles of association to transfer to Taurus. This signals growing acceptance of the system in the corporate world. Others to lag on some aspects of the G30 recommendations include the US, which has yet to make the switch to T+3. Concern in some quarters of the securities industry about whether such a short settlement period is suited to retail investment has helped to stall the move. In spite of this, the G30 can claim credit for focusing attention on the inadequacy of settlement arrangements and giving momentum to developments in a number of financial centres. Its involvement came after the 1987 crash, which brought home to the securities markets the extra risks involved with the slowness and inefficiency of settlement systems. 'The accounts of recent developments . . . make it quite clear that the momentum of reform is being maintained,' say Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne, former governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, in an introduction to the G30 report. 'The general direction is unmistakable. Rolling settlement is replacing account settlement; settlement periods are shortening; securities are being immobilised or dematerialised in central securities depositories to facilitate transfers by book entry; and there is a particularly welcome emphasis on improving DVP procedures.'

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: French notes weakened by pressure on franc 
text:  FRENCH government bonds closed lower yesterday as the French currency came under pressure and speculation increased that the Bank of France may be forced to raise its key interest rates shortly. Money market rates continued to edge higher, with three-month money quoted at around 11.5 per cent yesterday. The rise in money market rates forced several French banks to raise their base lending rates from 9.45 per cent to 10.00 per cent yesterday afternoon, and led to more speculation over whether the Bank of France would be forced to raise its 5-to-10 day interest rate shortly to help support the franc. Dealers said there was further speculation over whether the French currency would be devalued or allowed to float outside the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Short-dated bonds dropped during the day with the yield on the 8 per cent bond due 1994 moving from 8.40 per cent to 8.60 per cent. Longer-dated issues were less seriously hit, with the yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 moving from 8.27 per cent to 8.29 per cent. News that the prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, was holding a press conference this morning led to speculation that an important announcement would be made concerning the franc. However, dealers said the prime minister's office was later understood to have denied that there would be a statement on a devaluation, claiming that the press conference would simply provide an opportunity for the press to put questions to the prime minister. 'The worst possible scenario for the bond market is if we have no devaluation but higher interest rates', said Mr Julian Jessop, economist with Midland Montagu, referring to the possibility that the Bank of France may raise its 5-to-10 day rate. Mr Dominique Barbet, economist at Paribas, said the decision by the commercial banks to raise their lending rates yesterday would 'increase the political pressure in France to either devalue the franc or float the currency'. Today's planned auction of FFr14bn to FFr16bn of two and five-year notes may further depress prices at the short end of the yield curve, dealers said. ITALIAN government bonds tumbled again at the opening following Tuesday's announcement that Mr Bettino Craxi, leader of Italy's Socialist Party, was under investigation for involvement in a political corruption scandal. However, after an initial fall of about a point, the bond market recovered some of its losses. The March futures contract, which opened at 92.93 and fell to a low of 92.00, ended the day at 93.20. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds traded in a narrow range with the Liffe bund future contract edging up from 91.57 at the opening to a high of 91.60. UK government bonds closed higher in thin trade helped by weaker-than-expected retail sales figures for November. Retail sales fell 0.1 per cent between October and November, after a 0.2 per cent increase the previous month. In the cash market, the 10 1/2 per cent gilt due 1997 edged up from 110 17/32 to 110 19/32 , while the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 improved from 108 9/16 to 108 23/32 . A drop in the Tokyo stock market rekindled hopes of an easing in interest rates and helped to lift Japanese government bond prices yesterday, dealers said. The Nikkei average index fell 212.03 to 17,268.71 and dealers said further falls in the stock market would revive hopes of a cut in the Official Discount Rate soon. The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.62 per cent, the low of the day, and ended at 4.615 per cent. US Treasury prices firmed yesterday on the back of economic news suggesting that the US economy is growing gradually. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  7/32 higher at 102 5/16 , yielding 7.425 per cent, while the two-year note was up  3/16 to yield 4.624 per cent. The market moved slightly on the release of housing starts for November, which rose 1.5 per cent. In addition, industrial production rose 0.4 per cent in November. In the afternoon, the Treasury said it would auction Dollars 11.25bn in five-year notes and Dollars 15.5bn in two-year notes.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan withholding tax expected to continue 
text:  THE Japanese government is likely to approve the continuation of withholding tax exemption for Japanese corporate bonds issued overseas. The decision, expected to be finalised today by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Research Commission, comes after strong lobbying from Japanese companies and securities houses, which feel the introduction of withholding tax would deter overseas investors. The Keidanren, the federation of leading business organisations, the Federation of Electric Power Companies, and the International Primary Markets Association, lobbied against the abolition of the withholding tax exemption rule for non-resident investors, or Article 6 under the Special Taxation Measures Law. The special law is reviewed every two years, and will expire next March. Japanese companies face a wave of equity-linked bond redemptions over the next two years, with maturities next year estimated at some Y10,000bn (Dollars 80.4bn). Most companies are expected to refinance these bonds through straight bonds. Underwriting of foreign bonds has become an important source of income for Japanese securities houses, which face a sharp drop in profits due to the sluggish volumes on the Tokyo stock market. However, the main beneficiaries of the move will be Japanese institutional investors, who are the leading buyers of Japanese corporate bonds issued overseas.

text:  COUPONS on Swiss franc straight bonds fell below 6 per cent yesterday, with a SFr300m 10-year issue for Osterreichische Kontrollbank, a regular borrower in the sector. Lead-manager Swiss Bank Corp admitted that the terms of the deal, with a coupon of 5.5 per cent, looked aggressive. The last time rates were at this level was nearly four years ago, when they were on the way up, it said. The market is convinced that rates have further to fall, it said, as the Swiss franc benefits from a shift of sentiment caused by the currency turmoil in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and other European countries. The previous issue from Osterreichische Kontrollbank, in early October, for SFr300m over 10 years through SBC, had a coupon of 6.25 per cent. In addition to the Austrian state guarantee, this latest issue could be helped by the general shortage of new paper at this time of the year, agreed bankers. SBC surprisingly led a second deal on a day when most other houses reported little or no new issue activity. Credit Local de France is raising SFr125m over seven years through a private placement, which SBC said was greeted less enthusiastically than the OKB bonds. It carries a coupon of 5 3/4 per cent. Elsewhere, the market expects the two separate Y10bn Euroyen issues for Daicel Chemical Industries to find their way back to Japan fairly quickly. One issue is for four years, the other is for seven years. Moody's, the rating agency, has lowered the long-term ratings of Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais. BNP's senior debt was cut to Aa1 from Aaa while Moody's cut the Credit Lyonnais rating to Aa3 from Aa2.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Volkswagen plans further cutbacks 
text:  VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest carmaker, is expected shortly to announce another round of restructuring, including heavy job cuts, following yesterday's announcement of a slide into loss in the last quarter of this year. The plans are expected to be agreed at an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory board on January 13, which will also approve sharp cuts in the new year's investment programme. According to Mr Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, heavy fourth-quarter losses would make a considerable dent in the full-year earnings, and he repeated an earlier warning that the dividend might be cut. The group made just over DM1bn (Dollars 637m) profit in 1991, and paid out DM11 on ordinary and DM12 on preference shares. He also forecast further trouble in the new year, when, he said, the German car market would shrink by 20 per cent and deliveries to Europe would fall 10 per cent. The motor trade had deteriorated 'suddenly and dramatically' since September, he said. Other factors included the recent appreciation of the D-Mark, which would cost the company DM200m. Extraordinary pension provisions during the quarter had drained a further DM485m, compared with DM85m in the comparable part of 1991. Mr Ullsperger, who gave no details of expected losses, said the group had also lost DM250m because of the forced closure of its Sarajevo plant in the former Yugoslavia. An illegal strike in Mexico had cost DM100m. Economies already made this year included a reduction of almost DM3bn in planned capital spending. Cost-cutting action already taken this year included cuts of DM1bn in spending plans for the Seat subsidiary in Spain, DM1.2bn at the German parent company - including DM250m in its plant in Mosel, eastern Germany - and DM400m in other overseas operations. In the spring, before the extent of the current downturn was suspected, VW announced plans to reduce its German workforce through natural wastage by 12,500 over five years. Around 6,800 domestic jobs have already gone this year and short-time working has been introduced in all its plants. Analysts said the company was now preparing its employees for even more dramatic action. They suspected the extra pensions provisions, necessary for the early retirement component of the payroll reductions, had been loaded into the fourth-quarter result to underline the need for greater economies. Mr Ferdinand Piech, who formally takes over as group chairman on January 1, is already having a profound influence on management thinking, according to analysts. He is an eng-ineer, known as a hard man to please, and dedicated to increasing productivity. VW produces 12 cars per employee each year compared with more than 17 at its rival Opel, owned by General Motors. Despite its problems, the group claimed to have increased its European market share from 16.4 per cent to 17.5 per cent this year. Group turnover was likely to rise 13 per cent to DM86bn and unit sales were expected to be up about 6 per cent at 3.5m vehicles. Volkswagen shares, which peaked at DM410 in May, dropped a further DM9 to DM235.50 on the news. Daimler-Benz, parent of Mercedes-Benz, also lost DM6.40, falling to DM506.60 after the group further reduced its production forecasts for 1992. Short-time working at the turn of the year would cut total output of cars to 529,000, compared with 578,000 in 1991. Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, said on Tuesday night that 1992 had been 'an annus horribilus although our house has not burnt down'. The group, which is currently reducing its workforce by almost 50,000, had made an early start on dealing with its difficulties, he said. Daimler expects full year profits to fall to around DM1.5bn after DM1.9bn last time. See Lex

Deutsher said in its formal takeover document that the offer would enable ITW to expand in south-east Asia and extend its Ramset businesses to Australia, New Zealand and the UK. However, Siddons said both the ITW offer and a rival ADollars 86m bid by Pacific BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK motor components maker, significantly undervalued the company. Siddons said it expected to publish an independent valuation of its assets before the end of the year. Deutsher's offer document said ITW would try to optimise Siddons' Asian distribution network and expand its product range and technology skills. Deutsher said no decision had been made about the future of Siddons' businesses or future employment levels. The offer said the bid would be funded by drawing on an unused USDollars 300m revolving credit facility with 13 US and international banks led by the First International Bank of Chicago. Pacific BBA has not matched ITW's offer, but has reserved its right to increase its bid.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Switzerland goes to the market on stock indices - The introduction of SILO and MILO 
text:  THE Swiss stock market is dominated by the shares of a handful of giant multinational industrial companies and banks. This has an important bearing on Swiss index futures. In the SMI index of the 21 leading Swiss shares, the three pharmaceutical groups, Ciba-Geigy, Roche and Sandoz, account for over one-third of the weighting, and Nestle alone another 28 per cent. Lombard, Odier, the Geneva private bank, argues that these companies' activities are so international that their performance has precious little to do with the Swiss economy or business climate. Thus, the SMI index and even the all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI), where the SMI 21 accounts for more than 70 per cent of the total market capitalisation, give a misleading impression of what is really going on. Lombard, Odier has developed two new indices, one of medium-sized Swiss quoted companies (the MILO index) and one of small Swiss companies (the SILO index). There already exists a Vontobel Small Companies Index (VSC), and Lombard, Odier acknowledges that the performance of it and SILO are much the same, even though composition criteria are slightly different. Lombard, Odier uses the same criterion, market capitalisation, for selecting the components of its indices as the SMI, and is basically taking up where the SMI leaves off. The MILO index is composed of the 94 listed securities of the next 50 largest companies after the SMI 21. SILO reflects the remaining 295 listed shares of 209 companies. Why draw the line at 50? It seemed the right place to split between medium and small companies, Mr Serge Ledermann, Lombard, Odier head of Swiss research, says. It also happens to be close to the capitalisation of SFr500m which is accepted as the border between small and medium-sized companies. Lombard, Odier has been able to project its indices backward to 1980. The result is not a pretty picture. Both MILO and SILO have underperformed the market as a whole, SILO disastrously. The SBC index of nearly the whole market, for example, has doubled since 1980 while MILO is up only 80 per cent and SILO is down 20 per cent. The divergence in performance is particularly pronounced since 1988. The SMI (which was introduced in 1989) is up 30 per cent, while MILO is off 12 per cent and SILO nearly 50 per cent. Lombard, Odier analysts say this is to be expected, given a high inflation rate and the Swiss government's credit squeeze in that period. Also, the smaller company shares are generally less liquid and not of interest to index funds. In recent weeks, the uncertainty over Switzerland's referendum on joining the European Economic Area has accentuated the divergence between big and small shares still further. But it may also point to some opportunities when signs of recovery in the Swiss economy appear. Many of the companies in these indices have made great efforts to improve their competitiveness in the past few years. 'In the mid-range we think we will find the blue chips of tomorrow,' says Mr Ledermann.

Earlier this week, Jardine announced it had bought the C &amp; C stake from OCBC Securities, a company owned by the Singapore-based Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp. Singapore-based investment analysts said the Jardine move was both good and bad news for the island republic. The purchase has brought life into what has been an inactive local market. It also signals a further move by Hong Kong's biggest 'Hong' - or trading house - into Sing-apore. In late October, Jardine announced that its retail division, Dairy Farm International, would buy the Singapore retail company Cold Storage Holdings for SDollars 130m. But brokers were concerned about the effects on the local market of continued KIO disposals. 'The KIO has sold a large chunk of its holdings in this part of the world in recent months,' said one broker. 'If it sells everything in a hurry then it could cause some nervousness around the region.' The KIO still retains substantial shareholdings in blue chip stocks in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. It also has extensive property holdings and is involved in the plantations sector. A consortium led by Singapore's Keppel Corp has acquired the Philippines National Oil Dockyard and Engineering Corporation (PDEC) for 680m pesos (Dollars 27.6m), Reuter reports. The offer by Keppel and its three Philippine-based partners was the highest among foreign bids which closed in October. The sale of the 22.9 hectare yard is part of the Philippine government's effort to privatise state-owned companies and revitalise the Philippines economy.

The Caja, the largest insurance company in Argentina with a 13 per cent market share, is the latest of a number of companies to be offered for sale by the government since it began an ambitious privatisation programme in August 1989. Kleinwort Benson, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, together with its local partner, Harteneck Lopez, have been retained to advise on the sale, which is expected to go ahead as soon as March next year. Kleinwort has been involved in other Argentine privatisations in the energy sector including the sale of Gas del Estado, but this is its first venture in the financial services area. Mr John Williams, of Kleinwort Benson, said that the government was seeking to sell a majority stake of between 50 and 60 per cent of a new holding company, which would in turn own the Caja's insurance and banking businesses. The government is likely to be looking for possibly as much as one-and-a-half times the these assets, added Mr Williams. Caja's net assets are currently estimated at between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m. Companies in North America, Germany, and France had already expressed signs of interest, said Mr Williams.

text:  A US JUDGE has overturned a Dollars 338m jury verdict brought by Standard Chartered against Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, in a move which paves the way for a new trial next spring. Judge John Sticht, of the Superior Court of Arizona, has granted PW's motion for a new trial, which was submitted in July following a verdict last May against the firm on seven of eight charges. In a memo circulated yesterday to all his Price Waterhouse partners, Mr Shaun O'Malley, the senior partner in the US, says the judge called the jury verdicts 'so irreconcilably inconsistent as to be blatantly erroneous'. But Standard Chartered said last night that it remained confident in its claims and would be 'pressing forward to recover the full amounts, together with the interest now accruing'. It has the options of appealing the judge's verdict, pursuing the new trial or entering out-of-court discussions for a settlement. The PW memo said no such discussions had yet taken place. The court case stems from a lawsuit brought in 1988 by Standard Chartered which alleges that Price Waterhouse had failed to identify and report 'material deficiencies' in the loan portfolio and internal controls system of United Bancorp, an Arizona bank bought by the UK bank in 1987. Standard Chartered paid Dollars 335m for United, which made heavy losses, and 18 months later sold it to Citicorp for Dollars 207m. The UK bank's lawsuit claimed that Price Waterhouse was negligent in its 1985 and 1986 audits of United Bancorp. The trial in Arizona lasted 11 months until last May, and has already cost Price Waterhouse and Standard Chartered millions of pounds in legal fees. If Judge Sticht had not granted the application for a new trial, PW would have been forced to produce a bond of at least Dollars 200m before it could have appealed the verdict to a higher court. Standard Chartered announced the sale of 13 commercial buildings in Hong Kong housing some of its branches, which it will lease back from the local purchaser. The sale proceeds before disposal costs will be Pounds 64m (Dollars 97.3m) while the cost of the properties including improvements was Pounds 9m. The bank said the sale would increase its Tier 1 capital by Pounds 55m.

Mr David Morton, chairman and chief executive of the Canadian group, forecast that demand should grow significantly in 1994-95, adding that it was 'a period when no additional primary capacity would becoming on-stream', AP-DJ reports. Mr Morton said net capital spending in 1993 would again be lower than the USDollars 880m spent in 1991. He added that the level should be 'below Dollars 500m'. The company is expected to end the year with about Dollars 530m in capital spending. Since 1989, Alcan has cut about 8,000 jobs, or 14 per cent of its work force, and has scaled back production costs as well as selling and administrative expenses. Through the first nine months of 1992, the company has cut Dollars 166m in costs, after inflation. Mr Morton said the industry's oversupply was not likely to be remedied in the coming year. There is about a 1.5m metric ton surplus of aluminum, in large part because of production by the former Soviet Union. He added that a 500,000-ton swing in the surplus could cause a 'rocketing' in aluminum prices, which are currently about Dollars 1,200 a metric ton. Such a swing, he pointed out, could come from one or two smelters dropping out, and from a surge in imports by China, which 'is growing like a weed'. Mr Morton said the company would set up an office in Moscow which would be in operation in the next quarter. He said that the new office would help identify and pursue opportunities in metal trading, the sale of smelter technology, possibly joint research and development, and downstream fabrication. But, he went on, 'we are not rushing out there with an open cheque book'.

In Toronto, O&amp;Y said the filing was based on the November proposal under which senior creditors could claim their collateral at any time. This eliminated an earlier provision that would have delayed this right for five years and required further capital injections into O&amp;Y's flagship office towers in Toronto. Under the new plan, senior creditors could take back O&amp;Y properties immediately and O&amp;Y would become a management company controlled by the Reichmann brothers. Besides the main Canadian properties, creditors could also seize O&amp;Y's stock in Abitibi-Price, the Canadian forest products group, Gulf Canada Resources, an energy company, and Trizec, Canada's largest publicly-traded property holding company. About 34 creditor groups will vote on the plan in the week of January 11. Meanwhile, O&amp;Y remains under bankruptcy protection in Canada. O&amp;Y is negotiating separately to restructure its US property holdings. Several bankers and bondholders, who did not wish to be identified, said if creditors refused the plan, for closure proceedings could begin immediately as institutions rush to seize collateral. A vote in favour would mean acceptance of what amounts to an orderly liquidation of the O&amp;Y Canadian business under which further negotiation might be possible.

The company, which earned Dollars 189m, or 90 cents a share, in the 1991 fourth quarter, also said fourth-quarter revenues would be 25 per cent above the third quarter's Dollars 1.43bn. According to estimates collected by Zacks Investment Research, Intel's fourth-quarter net income per share is forecast to be between Dollars 1.15 to Dollars 1.30 a share. Estimates from IBES place the figure between Dollars 1.15 to Dollars 1.36. Mr Andrew Grove, Intel chief executive, said the combination of seasonal strength, brisk personal computer unit demand, worldwide migration from the Intel386 to the Intel486 microprocessor, excellent factory performance and solid demand 'for our other products' was producing better-than-expected fourth-quarter results.

text:  AMOCO, the Chicago-based energy group, has underlined the trend in the US oil and gas industry towards keeping a tight rein on capital spending and directing more funds to projects outside the US. Amoco said it planned to spend Dollars 3.2bn on capital investment and exploration next year, a budget that is largely unchanged on the spending level authorised for this year. Some Dollars 1.85bn of this amount will be devoted to exploration and production, of which 70 per cent, or some Dollars 1.3bn, will be outside the US. Last year, the company spent Dollars 1.275bn on exploration and production overseas. A growing number of US oil and gas companies have decided recently to redirect exploration efforts away from the US. This trend results partly from congressional and local restrictions on drilling offshore of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Last July, Amoco announced cost-cutting plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or 16 per cent, by the end of next year. In the first nine months of this year, Amoco's net income was Dollars 222m, compared with Dollars 1.33bn in the same period of last year.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Argentine insurer's issue cleared 
text:  THE ARGENTINE parliament has given the go-ahead for the privatisation of the Caja Nacional de Ahorro y Seguro. The Caja, the largest insurance company in Argentina with a 13 per cent market share, is the latest of a number of companies to be offered for sale by the government since it began an ambitious privatisation programme in August 1989. Kleinwort Benson, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, together with its local partner, Harteneck Lopez, have been retained to advise on the sale, which is expected to go ahead as soon as March next year. Kleinwort has been involved in other Argentine privatisations in the energy sector including the sale of Gas del Estado, but this is its first venture in the financial services area. Mr John Williams, of Kleinwort Benson, said that the government was seeking to sell a majority stake of between 50 and 60 per cent of a new holding company, which would in turn own the Caja's insurance and banking businesses. The government is likely to be looking for possibly as much as one-and-a-half times these assets, added Mr Williams. Caja's net assets are currently estimated at between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m. Companies in North America, Germany, and France had already expressed signs of interest, said Mr Williams, while Mapfre, the large Spanish company which already has strong Latin American subsidiaries, could also be a bidder. The Caja sells annual life, motor and general insurance. Annual premiums in the year to June 30 amounted to Dollars 503m. Its commercial and savings banks had over Dollars 566m in deposits at the end of June. At present, the company sells simple term life insurance products, but prospects for life business could be transformed by new pensions legislation planned for next year which will permit the provision of private pensions. The life industry in neighbouring Chile grew strongly in the 1980s following similar legal changes. The Caja also has good distribution with a network of 42 branches and 12 agencies. It employs 3,064 people, of whom 1,972 work in insurance and 1,092 in banking. Argentina also plans to sell off the nationalised reinsurance company Instituto Nacional de Reasseguros (Inder). probably next year.

text:  PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to switch to historical-cost accounting from its previous current-cost system with retroactive effect from January 1 1992. The move is part of wider changes in accounting policies designed to bring the company into line with most other big international companies. Philips also plans to use the US dollar as the 'functional' currency in highly inflationary South American countries such as Brazil instead of the local currency. This will enable Philips to simplify reporting by dropping the lines 'revaluation,' 'gearing adjustment' and 'monetary adjustment' for these local currencies from its annual financial reporting. If these changes had been implemented in 1991, Philips' net profit from normal business operations would have been around Fl 881m (Dollars 489m), Fl 100m lower than the published figure. The ratio of total liabilities to total capital employed would have been 75.8 per cent against 73.5 per cent. The changes, foreshadowed in the company's 1991 annual report, coincide with the appointment at the end of the month of a new Anglo-Saxon-trained finance director, Mr Dudley Eustace, the former finance director of British Aerospace. Mr Eustace, who joined Philips in mid-1992, will be taking over from Mr Henk Appelo, who is retiring. Philips also said it would adopt new US standards on post-retirement benefits such as healthcare and other non-pension benefits for its former employees around the world. On software, Philips is to apply the principle of capitalising the expenditure on software for certain products and then writing this off over the product's life. However, it said it would not be capitalising any expenditure this year 'in the interest of prudence'. The company will also move to a more international practice on goodwill payments by capitalising and amortising them. Dutch accounting rules allow a company to charge goodwill directly to shareholders' equity. In a recent interview with an in-house magazine, Mr Eustace said he planned to start up a high-profile programme of holding meetings with analysts and fund management to coincide with the release of quarterly figures, in line with Anglo-Saxon practice. He also said cutting the debt bill would be a priority. 'If there was just one thing I would like to achieve in the next five years, that would be to make this company healthy again by substantially reducing its debt,' he said.

headline:  FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Suez to expand capital of two banking subsidiaries 
text:  THE precarious state of the French property market has forced Suez, the industrial and financial group, to pump FFr2.36bn (Dollars 430m) of new capital into Indoseuz and Credisuez, two banking subsidiaries. Suez, which has extensive holdings across the French property sector, has already made provisions of FFr1.9bn on property losses. It is expected to make additional provisions for the second half, in addition to the recapitalisation which will inject FFr800m into Indosuez and FFr1.56bn into Credisuez. The announcement of Suez's refinancing comes when France's banks and insurers are awaiting the announcement of government proposals to support the property industry. The property market has experienced difficult problems for the past three years, particularly in Paris where average rentals have fallen by 20 per cent. The Paris market has not fared as badly as that of London or New York, but French financial groups have still suffered sharp falls in the value of their property holdings. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, recently estimated that the French banks' outstanding property loans were between FFr400bn and FFr500bn. Suez saw its interim net profits fall to FFr500m for the first half of 1992 from FFr1.8bn in the same period last year, mainly due to the large rise in property provisions. Indosuez alone raised its interim loan loss provisions to FFr1.39bn from FFr517m, triggering a slide in net profits to FFr82m from FFr517m. Banque La Henin, which is linked to Credisuez, barely broke even in the first half because of property problems. La Henin has already been restructured and will receive FFr560m of the capital Suez is injecting into Credisuez. The announcement of the recapitalisation comes when Suez is under pressure from Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurer, which is one of its largest shareholders, to cede control of Colonia, a German insurer. Suez recently broke off negotiations with UAP over Colonia. World Stock Markets, Page 35

The group said premium income would rise 3 per cent to SFr6.3bn. Life business growth was weaker than in 1991 but satisfactory.

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The art of seduction  -Money spent on packaging can go a long way 
text:  Seducing customers into buying your product and building a loyalty from that initial purchase are key marketing problems. Few steps are more important in that seduction than getting the packaging right. Ugly, old-fashioned presentation can ruin a brand or newly launched product; first impressions are critical. But packaging designers in particular are fast learning that in a recession they need to demonstrate the commercial, bottom-line value of their work; cosmetic skills alone are not enough. The traditional UK jam and marmalade market has been in steady long-term decline - down from 109,000 tonnes in 1984 to 89,500 tonnes in 1991. In the 1980s healthier, lower-sugar diets became fashionable, product innovation seemed limited, preserves manufacturers waged price wars, and own-label preserves took market share from brands. All that left little room for lavish promotional spending. The only growth niche seemed to be in low-sugar preserves, but consumers were turned off by unconventional tastes and textures. Chivers Hartley, a division of Premier Brands and a traditional name in preserves, decided to develop a low-sugar preserve range which also tasted good. It set about new product development in conjunction with a London design consultancy, The Design Bridge. Chivers developed a new cooking process with a much higher fruit content, emulating the taste and texture of higher-sugar jams and marmalades. But equally important was the development of a new packaging design. Chivers set itself the target of taking 5 per cent of the low-sugar market last year, the first full year of the new range, called Hartleys Extra Fruit; it took 7 per cent. According to Mike Whetter, Chivers Hartley's marketing manager, the packaging design was 'absolutely fundamental. If you get your design right you are well on the way to success. If you get it wrong, then you'll never succeed.' Perfecting the packaging design can also help make or break product relaunches. In February 1990 Chivers Hartley took a step into what was then a relatively new market, ready-made convenience desserts, with a range called Chivers Fruit Cup. The market has grown to a retail value now of some Pounds 19m annually. But the dominant green colour of the original packaging meant that retailers frequently placed the product - fruit in jelly - on shelves next to canned fruit. Consumers failed to be tempted, and the product reached only 60 per cent of all retail outlets. 'We found that the graphics of the pack were totally underselling the product and were not conveying what was inside the pot. The pack itself was not exciting them to pick it up and try it,' says Whetter. Chivers Hartley literally went back to the drawing board. Design Bridge worked out new colours, graphics and packaging, and the Fruit Cup range was relaunched earlier this year. Mike Whetter is confident that the range will increase its market share from the 5 per cent taken on relaunch to 8 per cent by the end of the year. The total cost of relaunching Fruit Cup, including design work, he puts at Pounds 120,000. 'New product launches like this are very difficult; marketing money here is sacred, we have to make every pound work hard for us. We have a total marketing spend of about Pounds 2m annually; about 3.5 per cent of turnover,' says Whetter. Packaging designers are increasingly being consulted at an early stage of new product development. The Design Bridge was called in by chocolate manufacturers Terry's of York, which in 1989 decided to produce a premium 'special treat' chocolate bar. Aimed at 25-44 year old women, the new bar was designed to capture qualities such as 'indulgence', 'richness' and 'uniqueness' in an already crowded market. The design brief was to develop packaging which would sell the bar as a luxurious treat; understated, yet appealing to women purchasers looking for more than a quick chocolate 'fix'. The new bar, called Moments, exceeded its first year sales targets by 47 per cent, with retail sales of Pounds 10m in 1991 - an achievement in a market where more than four out of five new product launches fail. Good packaging design helps sell more than food and snacks. Wickens Tutt Southgate, another London design agency, has worked on several accounts to re-vamp brands in equally competitive markets, such as paint aimed at do-it-yourself home owners. The leading UK brand name for specialist paint for metal is Hammerite, made by Hunting Specialised Products, based in Northumberland. Hammerite has a 77 per cent share of this market, but at the end of the 1980s it became concerned that its image was too 'professional' for some purchasers - particularly women - and decided to re-launch its brand, broadening its appeal without losing existing customer loyalty. According to Guy Falkenham, European marketing controller of Hunting, money used to obtain successful design is as important an ingredient of successful marketing as advertising spend. 'It is very expensive to sustain a television advertising campaign 12 months of the year; we spend in excess of Pounds 1m on a six week TV campaign,' he says. 'TV advertising has terrific influences on sales - we have seen 600 per cent increases for the period during and immediately after television advertising. That's very good, but you can only sustain it for so long.' So Hunting briefed Wickens Tutt Southgate to create packaging both more 'aesthetically pleasing and informative and with less of a macho image. We tried to cut through technical jargon and back-of-pack caveats,' says Falkenham. Hunting consolidated two brands - Hammerite and Smoothrite - into one single brand. The designers came up with a branding device, a shield, to symbolise strength, protection and durability. In Falkenham's view, good packaging design is vital but only one element in an overall sales promotion effort. Nevertheless, get it wrong and it can be costly: 'Your chances of success with a good design are quite limited, the consumer will only grasp one or two elements of the design of the pack.' But given the choice between Pounds 1m for six weeks of television advertising and Pounds 60,000 for design work on a brand launch, it must make sense to get the drawing board out before hiring the film crew.

text:  A FAVOURABLE cash position at Victaulic offset difficult trading conditions enabling the pipes and fittings maker to report unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.9m for the six months to June 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 57.4m to Pounds 51.2m, mainly reflecting reduced demand for pipelines from British Gas which has cut back heavily on capital expenditure. This is because of uncertainties regarding the future structure and ownership of British Gas's network following the referral of these matters to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The uncertainty is likely to continue into next year. Mr David Stewart, Victaulic's managing director, said that British Gas had began to cut back on new projects since the beginning of the year. In the water industry, the group's other main market, some of the water companies reduced their investment on the repair and maintainance of mains, affecting sales of Viking Johnson, which is involved in the refurbishment of mains. The difficult trading conditions were reflected in trading profit, which fell from Pounds 6.79m to Pounds 6.46m. However, net cash of Pounds 10m resulted in interest received of Pounds 461,000 compared with Pounds 57,000 in the comparable period. Mr Stewart said cost reductions, a decline in the workforce and increased margins of 12.6 per cent compared with 11.8 per cent had also helped offset difficult trading conditions. The interim dividend is increased from 2.35p to 2.5p. Earnings per share were unchanged on last time's 10.3p.

In line with the rest of the industry, pensions registered the strongest results, boosted by rising unemployment as people made redundant transferred their pension funds. The ordinary branch's with-profits pension business saw a 60 per cent increase to Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 36m). New business in unit-linked pensions more than doubled, to Pounds 6.81m (Pounds 3.29m). Ordinary branch life assurance premiums were up almost 20 per cent to Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 34.9m), helped by the company's single-premium with-profits bond. Elsewhere in the group, industrial branch assurance new business rose from Pounds 58m to Pounds 60.7m. General branch premium income improved from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 15.1m and the underwriting loss was cut from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 2.3m. Britannic also announced reductions of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent in the terminal bonuses payable on 10-year and 15-year with-profits products. Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, attributed this to the sluggish markets this year, which had forced the company to make slight reductions compared to the high returns available in the mid-1980s. He pointed out that Britannic was able to phase reductions in gradually by announcing terminal bonuses every six months, rather than annually as used to be the case.

Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive of Maple Leaf, said that while the merger would have 'solidified' the company's position in the bakery industry and simplified future acquisition opportunities, Maple Leaf was 'quite satisfied' to retain its present interest. CF has reported record profits for 11 consecutive years.

'This is up to the market's best expectations', he said. Irish recurring premiums were up 3 per cent to IPounds 135.9m (IPounds 131.9m).

The industrial holding group's 3-for-10 share offer, with a partial cash alternative, had been accepted by the holders of 10.2 per cent of the shares yesterday; that gave control to TT, which already owned 40 per cent. Now unconditional, the offer values MMG, a USM-quoted maker of magnetic components, at Pounds 11.1m - or 60.6p a share - using TT's closing price of 202p. Last year's cash bid was worth Pounds 9.9m, but more TT shares were on offer in the 4-for-10 paper alternative. The earlier bid was blocked by a family holding of 44 per cent, headed by Mr Eduard Michaelis, the group's nonagenarian founder. Since then the board had changed entirely, the group had been rationalised, planned property sales had proved difficult to attain and the economic climate had worsened. Mr Nick Walker, finance director, said the new board felt that TT could offer additional resources to MMG. The predator's tenure of a 40 per cent stake had created uncertainty over future ownership, inhibiting efforts to develop the business independently.

Mr John O'Brien, chairman, said: 'The existence of a dispute and the current investigation has been the subject of correspondence between solicitors instructed by Alliance and Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott.' He said the board was investigating the Dollars 1.5m fees incurred in Alliance's flotation at 40p in 1991. Gilbert Eliott claims it is owed Pounds 38,346 - in addition to the Pounds 71,635 already paid - and has served a petition to wind the company up. Mr O'Brien also confirmed that Manx Petroleum, where he is also managing director, had agreed to loan Alliance Dollars 200,000 to develop reserves. That agreement was officially concluded just two weeks ago, he said, and the money paid to Alliance. The chairman of Manx is Mr Algy Cluff, the natural resources entrepreneur. In addition to the loan agreement, Alliance undertook to pay Manx management fees of Pounds 10,000 a month. These charges were being accumulated and treated as debt to be repaid with the Dollars 200,000 loan. Mr O'Brien, who became chairman of the struggling Alliance on May 5, denied the management fees were high. He said Alliance shareholders would benefit from his restructuring of the company. He draws no salary from either Manx or Alliance, he said. Before he agreed to become chairman, Mr O'Brien set out the loan and management fee conditions in an agreement dated April 30. This was passed by the Alliance board on May 4, the day before he joined. The document also sets out an agreement in principle which states that 'when Alliance is sufficiently large to make an offer for Manx without prejudicing Alliance's listing . . . Alliance will make a recommended all-paper offer for Manx.' This would involve the issue to Manx shareholders of 11 Alliance shares for every one of Manx's. Mr O'Brien holds 29.9 per cent of Manx. The agreement was never made public. But Mr O'Brien said yesterday that Manx, having completed due diligence at Alliance, was no longer interested in the offer.

text:  CREDITORS OF Mountleigh, the property company which collapsed in May with debts of Pounds 590m, were warned at a meeting in London yesterday not to expect a swift realisation of assets. Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Stephen James, partners of KPMG Peat Marwick, joint administrative receivers, told creditors that the affairs of the companies in the group were so closely interlinked that it was impossible to estimate the probable distribution until the properties and assets were sold. Since their appointment, the receivers have raised Pounds 57m from property sales, part of which was used to discharge overseas borrowings on certain properties. The receivers said they were determined to avoid 'fire sales' of the remaining assets. They have drawn up a 'planned and controlled' disposal programme for the remaining properties. They plan to sell the UK properties over the medium term, in the belief that a quick disposal would not realise the properties' maximum value. In some cases, they said, work will be necessary to enhance the value of properties. The receivers said they were not aware of any moves to have liquidators appointed to any of the companies in the group which are currently in receivership. 'We do not believe that it would benefit the creditors to start liquidation proceedings now,' they said. Mountleigh's debts comprise Pounds 400m owed to a group of banks holding debentures and floating charges, Pounds 140m due to bond holders and about Pounds 50m owed to trade and other creditors. The receivers said they held out little hope of payment for unsecured creditors. Mountleigh owns 83 investment, development and trading properties throughout the UK, most notably the Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands.

Turnover at the financial training and publishing group rose to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 19m). The publishing side increased profits to Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 191,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 2.67m). Mr Richard Price, chairman, said some Pounds 900,000 of the advance was due to the inclusion of Melrose, which makes video-based training packages, and Letts Educational, a publisher of home-study books for A-level and GCSE exams, though there had also been about Pounds 100,000 of launch write-offs from a series of titles on financial risk management. Mr Price said the parts of BPP's training and publishing businesses which led to the taking of exams had remained 'fairly robust,' but activities not leading to exams had seen a fall-off in discretionary spending. He also pointed to the 'virtuous circle' whereby 'student-driven' expansion in courses for the Stock Exchange, banking, and all types of accountancy resulted in higher sales of the text books needed for those courses. Profits in professional training grew to Pounds 522,000 (Pounds 492,000) on turnover up Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 5.4m. The language training side - of which two thirds is overseas - increased profits from Pounds 439,000 - depleted by the Gulf war - to Pounds 620,000 on reduced turnover of Pounds 9.03m (Pounds 9.36m). Linguarama needed 'a real improvement in business confidence' to fulfil its potential. 'Softer recruitment' last September in the five independent sixth-form colleges, or crammers, owned by MPW resulted in lower profits of Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 642,000) in the academic education division. Earnings were 7.2p (6.4p) and the interim dividend 2.7p (2.4p). The group has no borrowings.

'The holy grail is to get tier 1 capital in tax-deductible form,' said Mr Brian Worsley, assistant treasurer at Barclays Bank. 'This structure is as close as we can get.' Under new international capital guidelines which come into effect next year, banks must hold tier 1 and tier 2 capital totalling 8 per cent of their assets. Barclays plans to issue undated, subordinated debt, which qualifies as upper tier 2 capital. This can be converted later, at the option of the bank, into preferred stock, which counts as tier 1 capital. As long as the issue remains in debt form, the interest costs are tax-deductible, providing considerable cost savings over a conventional preferred stock issue. Mr Worsley said that the debt would only be converted into preferred stock if Barclays' tier 2 capital was set to exceed its tier 1 capital, which is not permitted under the guidelines. Barclays current capital-to-assets ratio stands at 8.9 per cent, of which 5.9 per cent is tier 1 and 3 per cent tier 2. National Westminster Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland are among the banks which have also been looking at this type of structure. The same tax benefits are also likely to be available to other European banks, some of which are under considerable pressure to build up capital. A similar structure has already been used in the US by Bankers Trust, but the conversion into preferred stock in that case was mandatory. Barclays, on the other hand, can continue to deduct interest payments from tax until it decides to convert the debt into preferred stock. The structure has been developed by Barclays, in conjunction with Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, but Barclays has not yet mandated either US bank to arrange the US offering. The structure has been approved by the Bank of England.

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / Profits fall at Pioneer and Sony 
text:  SONY and Pioneer Electronic, the Japanese consumer electronics groups, each reported a steep decline in consolidated pre-tax profits in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which ended in June. The poor performance of both companies reflected weak demand throughout the world economy and the overcapacity in the consumer electronics industry that has led to a sharp inventory build-up and severe price competition. The industry is also suffering from a lack of new products with mass appeal. However, the declines in profits fell short of the worst fears in the market, where rumours on Monday that Sony had lost money at the operating level prompted a steep decline in share prices. Sony's pre-tax earnings were off 52 per cent to Y27.04bn (Pounds 110m), compared with the same period last year, while sales increased by 4.2 per cent to Y900bn. Pioneer saw its pre-tax profits fall by 38.5 per cent to Y9.87bn. Sales grew by 2.3 per cent to Y144.5bn. For Sony, which is a bellwether for the whole industry, the good news was that the company climbed back into profitability following a consolidated operating loss in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year amounting to about Y18bn. Sony's traditional electronic equipment business saw a year-on-year decline in profits of 46.7 per cent to Y27.3bn, while on the entertainment side of the business, which includes films and recorded music, profits grew by 26.3 per cent to Y9.45bn. The entertainment business, where Sony has enjoyed a string of hit records and films, has recently provided the only significant growth for Sony's business. However, analysts, and the company, say it is too early to tell whether Sony's expensive purchase of Columbia Pictures entertainment two and a half years ago has proved to be a success. Neither Pioneer nor Sony revised profits projections for the fiscal year ending next March; an indication that both companies are confident their businesses have stabilised, in spite of the deteriorating economic environment at home. For both companies, strong sales in the US helped to compensate for weakness in Japan. Results in full, Page 21

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / BICC pessimistic after 12% fall 
text:  THE longevity of the UK recession was brought home yesterday as BICC, the cables and construction group, announced a further fall in first-half profits. 'We do not expect any improvement in most of our markets until 1993 and even then volume recovery is likely to be modest,' said Mr Robin Biggam, chairman. No UK recovery was expected for 12 months. There was encouraging news on the Channel tunnel contract, which last year necessitated a Pounds 12m provision. BICC is involved in Transmanche Link, the consortium building the tunnel, and Mr Biggam said no further provisions should be necessary. BICC's interim pre-tax profit fell 12 per cent to Pounds 58m, from a peak of Pounds 100m in 1990. Sales were reduced in every part of the business, leaving group turnover at Pounds 1.77bn, against Pounds 1.9bn. Resilience in infrastructure markets and cost-cutting limited the fall in operating profit to 4 per cent, a total of Pounds 75m. Mr Biggam said operating profit was slightly ahead of the second half of last year. Rationalisation costs of Pounds 9m were taken at the operating level. Factory closures and other cuts were reducing the workforce at the rate of 10 per cent - or 2,000 jobs - a year. Interest charges rose from Pounds 12m to Pounds 17m. However, with Pounds 154m of rights issue proceeds arriving in June, net debt was eased to Pounds 15m going into the second half. BICC Cables, the European business, saw operating profit fall by 19 per cent to Pounds 47m on turnover of Pounds 500m. North America - where prices had at last started to firm - made a Pounds 1m profit, a turnround from a second-half loss of Pounds 5m. Australasia improved from Pounds 8m to Pounds 13m. Balfour Beatty, the contractor, increased profit from Pounds 13m to Pounds 15m on Pounds 869m turnover. The 72 per cent of the business in civil engineering and power had remained resilient. The group broke down its property portfolio to show Pounds 110m in projects completed or under construction - of which 40 per cent were rented at a rate of Pounds 4m a year; Pounds 65m in the Spitalfields joint venture; and Pounds 50m in frozen schemes. Earnings per share amounted to 11.2p, against 13.6p. The interim dividend was held at 6p and Mr Biggam underlined the group's intention to maintain this year's total at 19.25p after a strong cash performance. The share price gained 17p to close at 279p, compared with 285p for the rights issue. Lex, Page 16

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / Japanese publisher to take over Berlitz International 
text:  BERLITZ INTERNATIONAL, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation, which discovered a majority of its shares were pledged improperly to banks as collateral by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, has signed a merger agreement with Fukutake Publishing, the Japanese correspondence course and book publishing concern. If the deal is completed, existing Berlitz shareholders would own about one-third of the company's ongoing equity. Fukutake, which is making the offer through its US subsidiary, would hold the rest. The deal requires approval from two-thirds of the shareholders. That will be complicated as ownership of 6.8m of the 20m shares is in dispute and subject to legal action. When the formal offer document is issued, it is expected to require approval from both sides claiming ownership of these shares: Macmillan on one hand; and Shearson Lehman, Credit Suisse, Swiss Volksbank and Advest on the other. The announcement follows market speculation, and comes after Berlitz, based in Princeton, New Jersey, said earlier this month that it was in talks with parties interested in the possible takeover. Fukutake acquired 20 per cent of Berlitz's Japanese unit in 1990. A letter of intent, allowing Fukutake to buy the 56.5 per cent stake in Berlitz held by Macmillan, MCC's main US subsidiary, for Dollars 265m, was signed in November 1991. That was rendered void when MCC went into bankruptcy, following Mr Maxwell's death late last year. Since then, MCC has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. At present, most of the Macmillan stake in Berlitz is in the hands of five banks and companies that received stock as collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Apart from shareholder approval, the deal between Berlitz and Fukutake is conditional on certain transactions, involving share transfers and the waiving of claims by MCC. Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC, refused to comment yesterday, saying the issue was sensitive because ownership of Berlitz shares is still in dispute.

text:  Sir, Professor Gavin McCrone (Personal View, August 17) correctly identifies the benefits of an enlivened private rented sector, the help it would provide in getting out of recession and the critical importance of persuading institutions to re-enter this market. But he is off the mark in saying that 'rent controls . . . have now been removed'. Rent controls still exist and, if anything, are being applied with increasing intensity. In the east end of London, 'fair rents' on properties controlled under Section 70 of the Rent Act of 1977 are about 20 per cent of open market rents - probably the lowest relative level for many years. Our company has one controlled tenancy dating from 1945 in which, by way of his subsidised rent, the tenant has received more than twice the capital value of the property he occupies. The means the DoE uses to maintain controlled rents at derisory levels amount to an abuse of the legal system. Institutions abandoned the private rented market because many fingers were burned by retroactive legislation creating controlled tenancies out of agreements freely entered into by both parties. The large number of empty flats above shops and offices in every high street reflects the resolve of the same institutions not to expose their fingers again. As long as there are controlled rents for a significant number of tenants, the private rented sector will never be revitalised. If the government seriously wants to enliven the private rented sector it could do so at a stroke by abolishing rent control. But is is unlikely to do so, if only because this would increase the PSBR through housing benefit claims and, perhaps, deprive it of the votes of those tenants who would now have to pay a proper rent. The government apparently hopes the passage of time will solve the problem: rent-controlled tenants, many of them elderly, will eventually die off. But I need hardly point out that landlords are growing old at roughly the same rate. M A Philcox, Park House Properties Delta House, 181-183 Romford Road, Stratford, E15 4JF

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / Letter: New law not necessary to achieve board accountability 
text:  Sir, Dr Maurice Gillibrand (Letters, August 11) is wrong in his premises and his conclusion that further legislation is needed to make company boards accountable. First, he is wrong to believe the CBI opposes the Cadbury Committee's recommendations. Rather, the CBI finds many positive features in the code at the centre of the Cadbury committee's draft report. Much of it represents what CBI members consider best practice. But we reject Cadbury's proposal that a statement of compliance with the code in the annual report and accounts be made a Stock Exchange listing obligation. Disclosure in this form will be bureaucratic because a statement which is both a listing obligation and subject to review by auditors will have to pass muster with a company's lawyers. Ques-tions of interpretation will inevitably be raised, and explanatory notes and more detailed rules will surely follow. The proposal is also unnecessary because it ignores how compliance will be achieved in practice. The code is, in effect, a checklist against which boards can measure themselves. It is also a tool which institutional investors can use; it is they who can effectively urge reform on boards which are failing to perform. They do not need the mechanism of a listing obligation. Dr Gillibrand asserts that boards have become self-perpetuating. This scarcely squares with the evidence of changes in the leadership of companies where shareholders have become dissatis-fied. For accountability to achieve its purpose, it needs to be exercised by regular process rather than dramatic intervention. Annual general meetings can be part of that process; and active participation by shareholders should be encouraged. We have urged that the responsibilities of shareholders (especially the institutions), as owners of the business, be spelt out in the Cadbury code. Institutional shareholders should, whenever possible, use their voting rights and declare to companies in which they have invested how they intend to exercise them Finally, Dr Gillibrand is wrong to conclude that more company legislation is needed and that two-tier boards should be part of reform. Matters in the code such as the calibre and independence of non-executive directors cannot be legislated. It is an error to suppose that the supervisory board can be transplanted from a country in which it has deep roots (back to the 1920s in Germany) and be fruitful in quite another tradition. Cadbury has already prompted many companies to review their board structures and procedures. The CBI looks forward to carrying the debate forward at its national conference in Harrogate in November at which Sir Adrian Cadbury will be presenting his recommendations.

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The benefits of lower house prices 
text:  Is there a contradiction in calling for lower inflation and a rise in UK house prices? Of course, there is. Asset prices, whether of commodities, houses or shares, are more volatile than the general rate of inflation. When inflation merely slows down, asset prices fall. When inflation rises slightly, asset prices rise by leaps and bounds, although there is no neat synchronisation. Just as most of the more sensible documents related to popular equity ownership contain a warning that share prices can go down as well as up, there should be a similar notice in every house agent's window. If we are serious in wanting stable prices, then we can hardly want a revival in house prices at so early a stage in the economic cycle: and schemes which attempt to bring this about are misconceived. House prices are on average some 10 to 20 per cent below their 1989 peaks, depending on the index used. But the regional variations have been large. According to Nationwide, the price to a first-time buyer in East Anglia is now a third below its 1989 peak. Any forthcoming economic package should be limited in intention to trying to discourage further falls and not to restarting the disastrous housing escalator. It is time to consider the benefits of lower house prices. In his article in the Weekend FT of August 8, John Authers mentioned that the initial annual mortgage payment, expressed as a percentage of average earnings, had fallen by a third for a first-time buyer from its 1989 peak. This is a great gain. Such couples are nevertheless still reluctant to buy, partly because of the general lack of confidence, but also because they are holding out for further price falls. The worst way to try to overcome this hesitation would be by an inflationary boost to the housing market. A rising trend of house prices would make it more expensive for future newly formed households to acquire accommodation, and thus impede the mobility of labour which ought to be one aim of housing policy. Another bonus from lower house prices has been the long-delayed revival of the rented sector. There have been numerous cases where letting has recently seemed a better proposition than leaving properties empty or selling them at a knockdown price. A sitting tenant is no longer always the drag on house values he or she used to be. The combination of rent decontrol on new tenancies and the house-price slump has given the rentals market the biggest kick start it has had for decades. Rented accommodation is inherently more convenient for many people, including the young and professionally mobile, than the commitments of home ownership. Such people were deterred from renting both by the lack of suitable properties, following decades of rent control, and by the belief that they would be fools to miss out on an investment which was sure to beat inflation by a comfortable margin. It will be a great gain from recent developments if people now regard houses as places to live rather than as guaranteed double-your-money investments, and allow the choice between buying and renting to be dictated by circumstances. People will no longer feel an economic imperative to 'trade up', and will decorate their homes to suit themselves rather than the estate agent. An even bigger social gain will be the end of houses as a topic of dinner table conversation. (If we could banish schools as well, we would really be getting somewhere.) Last but by no means least in the litany of benefits has been the puncturing of the price of urban land. At the end of the last decade, land constituted nearly 45 per cent of the price of a new dwelling in the south-east and East Anglia. This was a diversion of the national income from both capital and labour to the providers of space, for whom it was just a windfall gain. And one did not have to be an egalitarian to dislike the distributional effects which diverted an increasing proportion of the national income both to the owners of landed estates and the pension funds. In Greater London the average price of a hectare of land shot up from Pounds 390,000 in 1981 to Pounds 3.096m in 1989. By the first half of 1990 it was down again to Pounds 2.078m. There will be few tears about any further drops. The main focus of attention in recent discussion has, however, not been today's buyer, but the plight of those who bought homes in the boom of the late-1980s, whose dwellings are now worth less than the outstanding value of their mortgages. The Bank of England has estimated that there are nearly a million of these householders, with a total negative equity of Pounds 6bn, three-fifths of whom are to be found in the south-east. But it would be no more reasonable to restart inflation for their sakes than it would be to restart it for the benefit of property developers and their banking backers who are having difficulty in maintaining their policy of upwards-only rent revisions. There is an analogy with the victims of commodity price fluctuations. The latest thinking is to avoid rigging prices and instead to extend direct credits to the victims. Indeed, a special compensatory finance facility of the International Monetary Fund exists for this purpose. The aim is to cushion the well-being and spending power of the victims without impeding necessary price changes. A similar approach should be applied to homeowners in difficulties. An example of the right sort of relief would be to raise the Pounds 10,000 limit on building societies' unsecured lending, so that they can lend to homeowners who are good credit risks, but have been caught out by recent developments in the property market. An increase in total mortgage interest relief should be avoided like the plague, but the existing concession could be rearranged to make more available in the early years. It is important not just to avoid panic attempts at house-price boosting now, but to break the boom and bust cycle in the longer term. It is the boom that causes the bust as well as troubles of its own. There is no law of the Medes and Persians that house prices must in the long run rise at least as fast as earnings and twice as fast as the retail price index. This apparent trend was due to the rapid growth in households, 'Nimby' planning restrictions, rent controls and fiscal privilege for home ownership. The Nimby restrictions remain, but many of the other influences are declining. The restriction of mortgage interest relief to the basic rate will reduce fiscal privilege. So will the council tax due to start next year, which will re-establish in small measure some taxation of the benefit in kind from home ownership. Obviously the early 1990s have not proved the ideal time for either reform. But neither could be made while Mrs Thatcher was prime minister, with her misidentification of home ownership with economic virtue. If we wait for the ideal time no reform will ever be made. The task should be not to lose the benefits of the housing shake-out, but to convert them into long-term structural gain which will remain when recovery comes.

Its annual report deserves rigorous attention. The fees charged to local authorities rose by an average of 6.6 per cent during the 1991-92 year, compared with an inflation rate of 4.1 per cent. The report tries to justify this by comparing the rise with the 6.7 per cent rate of salary inflation in the financial sector. Average salaries rose by more than 10 per cent to Pounds 24,674, despite a fall in staff turnover for the third successive year. Meanwhile, Controller Howard Davies took a hardly less generous 9.9 per cent rise in total remuneration to Pounds 106,018.

text:  TODAY, HUNDREDS of thousands of UK school leavers will learn the results of their A-level examinations. Their future prospects - in higher or further education and the careers of their choice - will often depend upon the results. The headline news that entries and pass rates have again risen is cheering, but it cannot conceal the unacceptable damage which the A-level exam continues to inflict on the education system in England and Wales. The A-level exam is a highly refined procedure which successfully selects a small minority of students to go on to university degree courses, which reach a world-beating standard in just three years. The hurdle is necessarily set high, to screen out the three out of four young people for whom there are no university places. For that majority, there are various post-16 technical and vocational qualifications which - despite government reforms - are still a long way from enjoying 'parity of esteem' with academic qualifications among pupils, parents or employers. For those permitted to attempt the A-level hurdle, the penalty for failure is high. One in five entries results in a fail grade, leaving the candidate with nothing to show for two years' intensive study of the subject. Even the successful entrants must bend to the system's iron determination to impose premature and excessive specialisation: the brightest and best are encouraged to become scientists and engineers who cannot communicate, or arts specialists who can barely calculate percentages. Moves to broaden post-16 education have been resisted by ministers, who have been concerned to defend what they describe as the 'gold standard' of A-levels. The only concession has been the creation of AS-levels, examinations which aim to reach the standard of A-levels with around half the content. While these offer the opportunity for young people to take more subjects in the sixth form, they have not proved popular with either pupils or schools (which find them hard to timetable). This year, there were fewer than 53,000 entries, compared with more than 730,000 at A-level: the AS-level has clearly failed to catch on. A broader curriculum is necessary, drawing on the excellent and proven model of the International Baccalaureate. IB students take six subjects, with mathematics, English and a foreign language compulsory. Three subjects are followed at a higher level and three as subsidiaries, with the final grade depending on performance in all six. Whether this broader approach is adopted as part of a system which encompasses similar standards in technical and vocational education (as the French baccalaureate does) is a secondary matter. But the creation of a compatible system which provides a convincing range of qualifications suited to all talents and disciplines is long overdue.

text:  THIS WEEK'S report that the US government may wind down its funding for Sematech, the semiconductor research consortium, will cause satisfaction in various quarters. Set up in 1987 to help US semiconductor manufacturers tackle Japanese competition, Sematech was an isolated example of US taxpayers' money being spent on industrial policy in the European manner. If the semiconductor manufacturers are now to be left to their own devices, the principle of free markets is apparently reaffirmed. It may not be that simple. Sematech's demise is far from certain. If it comes, it will be at least partly because the programme has achieved its object. In essence, this was to demonstrate that state-of-the-art semiconductors could be made using only US equipment. This could not have been said five years ago. According to this week's report from the US General Accounting Office, it should be true by the end of this year. The contrast with such EC initiatives as the Jessi semiconductor programme is instructive. Jessi is bigger, more complex and more diverse in its objectives. It is also something of a mess. The difference may be traceable to the fact that Sematech was born in the ideologically hostile environment of the Reagan years. This gave it three starting advantages: a restricted budget - Dollars 500m of government money in all, a quarter the size of Jessi; correspondingly modest and achievable aims; and senior figures from the semiconductor industry rather than bureaucrats to run it. Granted, the wider effects of the project are not easy to define. At the outset, the underlying objective was to stop the US semiconductor industry's decline in world market share, then running at 3 per cent a year. The decline has duly been arrested. But this will have more to do with the achievements of individual US companies than with any technological advances produced by Sematech. The US industry also has a habit of holding market share during recessions and losing it again dramatically in the next upturn. It might be queried whether the Sematech experiment will be repeated in the US. It is hard to envisage another industry arousing the same protectionist fervour as semiconductors, which are central to the future of the wider electronics industry. In addition, the argument that domestic production of advanced semiconductors is essential to national security has lost some of its force with the end of the cold war. The Japanese electronics industry, too, is in a much more chastened mood than five years ago, partly because of the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble. It is therefore possible that Sematech will prove a one-off instance of co-ordinated industrial policy in the US. Either way, it points an awkward moral: that those countries which have least need of such policies are most likely to succeed with them.

text:  ACCOUNTING FOR GROWTH By Terry Smith Century Business Pounds 12.99. 223 pages It's bold, it's brash, it's labelled 'the book they tried to ban'. And a month before it was due to be published, it is already on the shelves. Rarely has a technical business book attracted so much advance publicity. The decision by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, to suspend Terry Smith, the author and head of its UK research department, has been well reported. UBS has issued a writ against him and his publisher after complaints from at least one of the companies cited in the text. Readers may find that the book does not deliver all it promises. It begins with a clear and important question: how can a company fail when its most recent set of accounts show a profit? Recent examples include Polly Peck, British &amp; Commonwealth and Maxwell Communication Corporation. During the past decade, there have been many more. The book sets the scene with a brief historical tour through the 1980s, which it calls the decade of the deal. Corporate finance activity expanded sharply, mergers and acquisitions surged and debt soared. After the party, the hangover of the 1990s. Companies are trying to reduce their debt burden in favour of raising money through share issues. But many are too late, says Smith, leaving 'bleeding balance sheets, soaring bad debts, devastating bank profits and penniless shareholders. The scene is littered with tarnished reputations and broken careers . . . and jail.' Accountancy, Smith argues, must take a share of the blame. Its flexible rules have allowed companies' financial information to be presented in ways that provide few warning signs to investors of the true position. In 12 chapters Smith explains a series of accounting techniques which have had the effect of improving the profits or reducing the significance of the debt on many UK balance sheets. None breaches existing standards. Smith does a good job of describing the techniques and their effects, illustrated with extracts from company accounts. He also provides three more detailed case studies of collapsed companies in appendices. The final chapter is probably the most useful. It lists six 'survival techniques' for investors in the 'accounting jungle'. Above all, Smith stresses that lack of cash is the reason companies fail - profits are secondary. He says investors should read accounts from the back forwards, looking for discontent in the resolutions at the annual general meeting, and the note on contingent liabilities, while skimming over the often uncritical chairman's statement at the front. Most of the controversy surrounding the book has been generated by a single 11-page chapter towards the end. Smith publishes a series of tables showing the top UK quoted companies, with blobs against each to show which of them uses the 12 techniques he has described. He is careful to issue provisos, stressing that inclusion 'does not automatically mean that the company is indulging in creative accounting'. But the implication - reinforced throughout the book - is clear: companies which use the techniques are massaging their figures. Unfortunately, his case is not proven. The techniques he lists are not only legal but also widely used. A case can be made for 'capitalising' costs by putting them on the balance sheet in certain circumstances, for example, a technique he attacks. Indeed, the practice is compulsory in the US. Most of the methods he highlights have either been changed or are under scrutiny by the new Accounting Standards Board and its associated bodies. This means the book's interest is historical and it is of little use as a predictive tool for identifying future collapses. In fact, Smith fails to establish the link between accounting practices and financial difficulty. He cites the poor share performance last year of a number of the companies which used at least five of the techniques. Yet his evidence is selective. He does not compare these figures with the worst-performing shares on the stock market during the period. He does not even include all the quoted companies which used at least five techniques. An analysis by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, shows that the average share performance of companies which did not use any of the techniques was worse than those which used at least five. There is a more fundamental problem. Smith draws heavily on public information in company accounts. Analysts ought to be able to extract this information and recalculate if they disagree with the accounting treatment adopted. Admittedly, this may be more difficult for less-qualified investors. The whole thrust of reform by the Accounting Standards Board is that investors should be less concerned with a single number - particularly earnings - and more with the accounts as a whole. It is the concentration on profits which has encouraged companies to inflate that figure. The book reveals at least as much about the readers of accounts  - particularly analysts - as it does about their compilers.

Do you remember those comforting stories about the British being really responsible for the post war German economic miracle thanks to their revolutionising German unions and German politics? Well now it seems that Japan's modern success can be put down to American initiative. Business Matters (7.30) investigates the influence of W. Edwards Deming who, in 1950, went to Japan to teach the natives quality control. The opening episode of The Climbers (8.00) promised an engrossing series. Today Chris Bonington treks to the Diamir face of the Nanga Parbat. The game show Ps And Qs (8.30) should either take snobbishness seriously and use Jennifer from 'Jennifer's Diary' and Garter King Of Arms, or whatever, to head the teams answering questions on etiquette, or it should self destruct. The opening episode last week was disastrous. Alan Bennett's series of solo dramas, Talking Heads, was superb and the episode repeated today, 'A Cream Cracker Under The Settee' (9.40) with Thora Hird as the house-proud pensioner who has a fall, is one of the best: marvellous writing and a tremendous performance.

text:  ALIEN 3 (18) Odeon Leicester Square WATERLAND (15) Curzon West End LOVERS (18) MGM Piccadilly, Odeon Mezzanine JERSEY GIRL (15) Plaza THE curtains part, the spotlights rake the monumental letters, then the 20th Century Fox fanfare turns into a long curdled shriek. Yes, the alien has penetrated that sanctum sanctorum, the Hollywood logo. How long before it spawns all over Tinseltown and grows too large for studio loyalty? Shall we see a full-size alien skeeter atop the Paramount mountain, or growl out from the MGM scroll, or impersonate the Columbia torch lady? In Alien 3, a film half silly and half splendid, the slobbering reptile with the curved black head and Meccano jaws once more demonstrates the terrors of ubiquity. This time it infests a distant planet functioning as an all-male penal colony under the brutal rule of one Superintendant Andrews. In any other film Brian Glover as the bald, bad, barking Andrews (no relation) would be the most charismatically grotesque thing on view. But the alien has landed, unwittingly brought in by Sigourney Weaver's battle-scarred Ripley, who crash-lands here from a previous adventure. By climax time, all is mayhem as before: the sudden glimpse of dripping jaw or oily tentacle, the starting-gun scream. New Zealand film-maker Vincent Ward (Vigil), who wrote the story but was ousted as director by pop video alumnus David Fincher, bequeathed the brilliant conceit of a group of ex-murderers and rapists living in an interstellar monastic foundry. Fumbling with their newfound mysticism - 'some sort of apocalyptic millenarian Christian fundamentalism' vaguely explains Medical Officer Charles Dance - they are like the cast of The Name Of The Rose flung into hyperspace. Weaver's grimy, crop-haired Ripley adds to the film's Rembrandt-goes-to-Hell look and the black comedy is vivid and versatile. The alien's secret birth is cross-cut with the pious words delivered at a prisoner's funeral ('There is always new life. . .'); an oxygen mask falls from a ceiling, its scaly hose momentarily suggesting something far worse; and a defunct robot is described as having 'negative capability.' (Thank you, Mr Keats, we will be in touch about the royalties. . .) But once the chase starts, wit and luminosity are replaced by gimmickry and pyrotechnics. Worse, the script by Alien veterans David Giler and Walter Hill with Larry Ferguson expunges the two most interesting male characters in an early kill, leaving Ripley to orchestrate the also-rans. A film that starts out as a crackpot masterpiece about cabin fever in the cosmos ends up as a monster flick comme tous les autres.                          *       *       * Though I have not read Graham Swift's fenland novel Waterland, I intuited that something was wrong with the film from its opening. What are we doing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania? Short answer: looking for an American audience. Jeremy Irons, sere of face and cicatriced with moustache, regales his college history class with trauma-packed memories of boyhood, sex and East Anglia. 'Sir, sir,' they all but cry, 'why are you telling us this?' 'Well, children,' he all but replies, 'because screenwriter Peter Prince and director Stephen Gyllenhaal (Paris Trout) think we should have a framing device to explain to you transatlantics what fens are and what England was like when everyone who lived in them went 'Ooohh, eeeggh, aaarrhh.' Incest, fishing, nude bathing, abortion, the Great War: it is all here. But what dismays about Waterland is less its off-the-peg pastoral torments - the village idiot brother, the dark hints of inbreeding, the love trysts in the barn, the old crone crowing over her abortion patients - than its lunatic attempt to extract a message for middle America. When not flashbacking to the fens, Irons pads around Pittsburgh explaining that his raunchy tales are as bona fide a part of 'history' as, say, the Battle of Valley Forge. Not surprisingly his fellow teachers disagree and think he should go. And his wife Sinead Cusack, ruing the infertility brought on by that long-ago pregnancy termination, has already gone. One half-admires the film's moments of stark courage: as when it literally tips Irons and his pupils into early-century Norfolk, driving them through the past in a vintage multiseater from which they view the beery natives on the eve of World War I. But even this smacks of Americanisation. The past used to be a foreign country; now it is a theme park. They speak a universal language there, one composed of folksy wisdoms about the child fathering the man and cinegenic proverbs about giving a human, picture-book touch to public or social history.                          *       *       * Victoria Abril, the pouting star of Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down] and High Heels, is quite wonderful in the Spanish film Lovers. The face at once gaunt and pixie-ish, the manner distrait and monomaniacal: she was born to play the beautiful widow who seduces the gullible soldier (Jorge Sanz) in this truth-based tale of love's young dream turning to nightmare and scandal. For the young man is courting his commandant's pretty, virginal maid (Maribel Verdu) when he takes lodgings - ah fatal day] - with Miss Abril. Soon she has him in bed and is doing unmentionable things with a silk handkerchief. Passion and perversity meet in hot embrace and Miss Verdu is left out in the cold. Even when the young girl gives up her virginity for the cause, she is no match for the siren. Miss A was trained, after all, in the Pedro Almodovar School of Absolutely Anything Goes. Sex, jealousy, handkerchiefs, cut-throat razors: it will be fun for a while and then end in tears or murder. Writer-director Vicente Aranda was inspired by a crime of passion in 1950s Spain, which sent its culprits to jail after Franco had commuted the death sentence. But the film is inspired by Miss Abril, who won the Best Actress prize last year at Berlin. With her moue of a mouth, spiky-lashed eyes and honeyed throatiness of voice, she is a junior-team Gloria Swanson presiding over her side-street Sunset Boulevard. What she and the film and its sex scenes will do to most male filmgoers I tremble to think. What they should do for Miss Abril's career is make her an international star.                          *       *       * Finally, Jersey Girl. Just for a moment I thought this might be a Lana Turner bio-pic. Miss Turner, once known as the Sweater Girl, was famous for making woollen garments bulge in all the right places. But no: this movie bulges in all the wrong places and the Jersey invoked is the place not the pullover. Toby (Jami Gertz) is the working-class out-of-towner who falls for Mercedes-owning New York yuppie Sal (Dylan McDermott). But can Cinderella hold on to her Prince Smarmy? Not until her girlfriends have screamed dire warnings, her gift-happy Pop (Joseph Bologna) has embarrassed her with his taste in evening dresses, her snooty Park Avenue rival (Sheryl Fenn) has tried to steal Sal back and - oh enough, you cannot want me to continue. We thought they did not make films like this any more, but it is the silly season and we were, alas, wrong. David Burton Morris directed.

text:  A NEW fund to protect customers of failed scheduled airlines should be financed by an increase in air transport licence fees rather than a supplement paid by passengers, the Civil Aviation Authority has told industry representatives. The CAA said variations in ticket prices would make it difficult to provide passengers with cash refunds. Instead, it envisages asking other airlines to honour the tickets of failed carriers, in return for an agreed proportion of the usual fare from the fund. The proposals are outlined in a letter from the CAA to airlines and trade bodies, following the announcement in March by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, then transport secretary, that the government intended to establish the fund. Mr Rifkind said protection for scheduled-service passengers would be limited to those using UK airlines. There are already arrangements to protect charter passengers. If the government had proposed protection against failure by foreign airlines as well, the CAA said it would have imposed a supplement on passengers at UK airports. It would otherwise have been difficult to collect contributions from foreign airlines. The CAA is opposed to the accumulation of a large fund, as investment income would be taxable. It envisages a fund of less than Pounds 10m - equivalent to about 25p per passenger over a full year. If the fund were exhausted it could be replenished by a levy and borrowing. The primary legislation needed to set up the fund is unlikely to be introduced before the 1993-94 parliamentary session, according to the CAA. It said it would consider industry views before making recommendations to the government.

text:  BARCLAYS Bank is to appeal against the High Court's refusal last month to grant it an injunction stopping the administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation suing it in the US bankruptcy court for Dollars 30m (Pounds 15.5m). The bank received the money, which it had demanded under an overdraft facility it had given MCC, three weeks after the death of Robert Maxwell in November last year. Price Waterhouse, the administrators, contended that the payment was an unlawful preference over the claims of other MCC creditors and asserted the right to sue for it in New York, where MCC is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Barclays argued that the English court was the natural forum for trial of the dispute because the overdraft facility was an English commercial transaction, governed by English law, to provide working capital for an English company and its UK subsidiaries. Mr Justice Hoffmann said that, though an English company, MCC's principal assets - estimated at between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn - were in the US, and the Dollars 30m had been paid to Barclays out of the proceeds of the sale of the computer publishing division of Macmillan, MCC's principal US subsidiary. He added that an injunction could only antagonise the US court and prejudice the co-operation between the Chapter 11 proceedings and UK administration.

text:  THE government yesterday moved to counter delays in the industrial tribunal system, but the proposals immediately came under fire for being inadequate. The employment bill, due to come before parliament in the autumn, will contain legislation allowing those who chair industrial tribunals to sit on their own rather than with two lay members in particular categories of cases which together account for about 25 per cent of hearings. More than half of the cases brought to English and Welsh industrial tribunals - the independent judicial bodies that settle disputes mainly between employees and employers about employment rights  - had waited longer than five months for a first hearing by last month. The tribunal chairman or chairwoman has legal qualifications and is aided by two lay members with practical experience in industrial relations. One is drawn from a pool nominated by employers' organisations and the other from a pool nominated by employees' organisations. The government also said it has offered more women and black people appointments as lay members. The new appointments will raise the proportion of women from 24 per cent to more than 27 per cent, while ethnic minority representation will rise from 3 per cent to more than 4 per cent. However, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, employment minister, said the figures were still too low. The number of cases brought has increased sharply in recent years because of legal changes, the decline of collective bargaining and the growing willingness of unions to represent their members at tribunals. Mr Stephen Cavalier, a partner in Brian Thompson and Partners, the firm of solicitors most active in tribunals, said more resources should be spent on the system and added: 'This measure is not sufficient to deal with the delays endemic in the industrial tribunal process.' The Confederation of British Industry said it would oppose any move to excessive legalism in the system.

He said Cuba had remained outside the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty as it did not want to renounce the right to possess arms needed for its defence.

text:  THE US merchandise trade deficit fell 7.7 per cent in June to Dollars 6.59bn, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, providing a modest fillip to President George Bush and his fellow Republicans at their current party convention in Houston. The administration hailed the 7.2 per cent rise in exports to a record Dollars 38.3bn as a vindication of Mr Bush's trade policies. However, imports were also a record, at Dollars 44.9bn, and more than 40 per cent of the increased exports was due to a volatile component, foreign sales of civilian aircraft, which rose by Dollars 1.1bn during the month to Dollars 2.57bn. For the first six months of 1992, the adjusted trade deficit totalled Dollars 35.5bn, compared with Dollars 30.5bn in the equivalent period last year. The higher export figure reflected increasing foreign sales of capital goods, industrial supplies and materials, vehicles, parts and engines, foods, feeds and beverages, and consumer goods. Although the rise in exports might not be sustained, foreign sales continue to provide the best news in the sluggish US recovery. The administration will use export growth to try to win voters over to the newly negotiated North American Free Trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. In June, the US ran a trade surplus of Dollars 334m with Mexico and a Dollars 440.6m deficit with Canada.

text:  INDIA'S external debt will rise to Dollars 93bn (Pounds 48.6bn) in five years from Dollars 74bn now, mostly because of increased foreign aid, the World Bank said in an annual confidential report to India's aid donors, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The bank said India would need about Dollars 10bn a year for the next five years to finance the current account deficit, repay its debt and increase foreign exchange reserves. India's current account deficit in 1992-93 is expected to double to Dollars 6bn from Dollars 3bn the previous year mostly due to the lifting of import curbs, the report said. The curbs were imposed in April 1991 when India was in the throes of a severe balance of payments crisis, amid caste and religious strife and political upheaval. Foreign bankers refused to extend new loans. The crisis forced Delhi to borrow Dollars 2.2bn from the International Monetary Fund and embark on a reform programme. 'Despite the large (debt) repayments, the substantial inflow of official assistance required to support the adjustment programme would raise India's external debt. . .to Dollars 93bn in 1996-97,' the report said. It said much of the aid to India in the past had not been used because of bureaucratic logjams and the government's inability to raise matching funds for projects. Foreign investment has had a small role in India. It averaged Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m a year from 1985-90, as opposed to Dollars 700m to Dollars 1bn a year in Indonesia, Dollars 1bn to Dollars 2bn in Thailand and Brazil and Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn in China.

text:  ON the roads leading south from the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, the logs seem to be everywhere: heaped in timber yards, lying on the verges, stacked in lorries or rumbling along slowly, one by one, on carts drawn by water buffalo. These days there are few large trees within sight of the roads. Shrugging off the risk of landmines, Cambodian peasants have brought the hardwood logs from the hills in the distance. Timber unsuitable or too small for the sawmill is sold as firewood or baked into charcoal in roadside kilns. There is no sign here of the Cambodian 'environmental ceasefire' urgently recommended by a report prepared for the UN in April. Instead, the world's timber merchants have taken advantage of the power vacuum in Cambodia to indulge in a frenzy of deforestation all over the country. The report estimates that legal and illegal exports in 1992 will reach about 1.15m cubic metres, more than four times the probable sustainable yield of 250,000 cubic metres. It also blames deforestation for flash floods a year ago and for the siltation of rivers and lakes. 'Following the signing of the Paris peace accords in October 1991, an unprecedented period of 'asset stripping' has begun in the forestry sector that is having a potentially catastrophic effect on Cambodia's remaining forest stocks and will further aggravate on-going degradation to the resource bases of both lowland agriculture and fisheries,' the report says. Cambodia's plight is made worse by the fact that neighbouring Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, after damaging their own forests, have imposed logging bans. 'People are forced to come to Cambodia to get their logs,' says Mr Rajeev Pillay of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Phnom Penh. The loggers can count on the inability of the Vietnamese-installed, lame duck administration to enforce such laws as there are. They can also depend on the eagerness of guerrilla factions to make the most of border territory they control before they yield their authority to the UN, in accordance with the peace plan leading to elections next year. Khmer Rouge guerrillas in western Cambodia - and their foreign business partners - are among the worst offenders. 'Is there anything wrong with buying wood from Cambodia?' a Thai buyer on the border was quoted by Reuters as saying recently. 'Or do you just want us to sit idle and allow the Singaporeans and Japanese to come in and take it all before the election?' The report, prepared for the Earth Summit, identified Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and France as buyers of Cambodian timber. Nor have Cambodians failed to notice the accelerating deforestation of their homeland. The report says some refugees have been disoriented on returning home by denuded forested areas made 'as bald as a monk's head'. However, it will be difficult to translate their concern into action until an effective government is in power. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of the transitional Supreme National Council, which embraces the four main Cambodian factions, emphasised the urgency of his country's environmental problems when he addressed a donors' conference in Tokyo in June. Shortly afterwards, Funcinpec, the royalist party, announced a complete logging ban in its territory, although Funcinpec officials acknowledge that their logging interests are less significant than those of other factions. 'The amount is very little compared to Phnom Penh (the Hun Sen government) and the Khmer Rouge,' said Mr Ek Sereywath. The Hun Sen administration has established an environmental committee but continues to sell timber, which is one of its few sources of income. The Khmer People's National Liberation Front has split into two factions - one civilian and one military - and the civilian leadership says it cannot stop the military officers from behaving 'like wood-eating termites' and selling trees. The Khmer Rouge, while refusing to co-operate with the UN and put its forces into cantonment areas, appears to be selling timber and gems as fast it can to increase its financial reserves. Dr Than Sina, one of Prince Sihanouk's palace advisors, says everyone is too busy with other matters to pay attention to the environment. 'The question of cantonment, the question of the Khmer Rouge, has overcast the whole issue. I think it's a matter of setting priorities for the future. I don't think anything can be done right now.' Without an effective military ceasefire in Cambodia, the chances of imposing an environmental ceasefire remain exceptionally slim.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         CAMBODIAN TIMBER EXPORTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991 (cu metres)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hun Sen government (at least 8 contracts)                   320,000 Illegal flows to Vietnam                                    250,000 Illegal flows to Thailand via Laos                          200,000 Khmer Rouge exports to Thailand (at least 5 contracts)      200,000 Funcinpec exports to Thailand (2 contracts)                 128,000 KPNLF exports to Thailand                                    50,000 Total                                                     1,148,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: UNICED  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Both sides agreed to discuss Kashmir and signed two agreements on the prohibition of chemical weapons and a code of conduct for diplomats in the two countries. Mr Shaharyar Khan, Pakistan's foreign secretary, described the sixth round of secretary-level talks as the 'most productive' so far, saying that agreement 'on the need to address the Jammu and Kashmir issue' was 'in itself a step forward.' Mr R L Bhatia, Indian minister of state for external affairs, yesterday told parliament that the Indian government believed dialogue with Pakistan was essential to 'lower temperatures' between the two neighbours. However, he pointed out that while India was willing to discuss all matters with Pakistan, 'meaningful discussions on bilateral issues, specially on more complex questions' could only be held once Pakistan 'stopped its support to terrorism and subversion in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab'. Categorically denying that Pakistan was fuelling terrorism in Kashmir, Mr Khan said that his country also faced a problem of terrorism in Sindh because of the free availability of arms. He suggested a joint approach to the problem. Mr Khan said that the wishes of the Kashmiri people would also be taken into consideration. When asked if Pakistan would agree to the option of an independent Kashmir, the foreign secretary said that a framework of the UN resolution already existed, implying that this was not an option. Although the confidence-building measures between the two countries have been more successful this time than before, foreign affairs experts in India are sceptical the sides will be able to hold meaningful talks on Kashmir, which has been the main obstacle to peace in the sub-continent for 47 years.

He also said it would be 'tragic' if Arab participants did not join constructively in Middle East peace talks due to resume early next week in Washington. Arab officials were due to meet in Damascus yesterday to discuss tactics for the sixth round of talks since the US-sponsored Middle East peace effort was launched in Madrid last October. Mr Peres said it was a 'tragic mistake on the part of the Arabs to appear negative, demanding, conditioning, postponing'. He urged the Palestinians in particular to join Israel in the search for peace without delay. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new prime minister, has called for an interim self rule agreement with the Palestinians within 12 months, and elections for a 'self-governing authority' in the West Bank and Gaza by next April. However, he infuriated Palestinians last week when he said that Israel was pressing ahead with 11,000 homes already under construction in the territories. Palestinian officials threatened to postpone participation in the Washington talks in protest at President Bush's decision to release billions of dollars in loan guarantees to Israel without securing agreement for a complete freeze on Jewish settlements. 'We are seeking a unified Arab stand to demand US clarification on the deal and guarantees of a complete freezing of all settlements on all Arab occupied lands, including Jerusalem, before the start of the August 24 talks,' Mr Yassir Abed Rabbo, a senior PLO official said in Amman. The PLO has indicated it will instruct the Palestinian delegation not to negotiate Palestinian autonomy without unequivocal Israeli commitment to stop all settlement buildings. The Palestinians will also demand clarifications from the Israel and the US on the status of East Jerusalem. The US has stipulated that the holy city be discussed later. But the Palestinians are demanding that it be dealt with as part of the occupied territories at all stages of the peace talks.

text:  BOLIVIA is to supply Brazil with natural gas from the start of 1995, under a preliminary agreement signed by President Fernando Collor of Brazil and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia, Christopher Philipsborn reports from La Paz. The gas will run through a proposed pipeline from Santa Cruz Department in eastern Bolivia to Campinas, in Sao Paulo state, 2,000km away. The World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and Eximbank of Japan are said to be considering loans for part of the pipeline's Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 730m) cost, with the rest to come from the private sector. At first, 8m cubic metres of gas a day are planned to reach Brazil, rising to 16m cu m. Prices will vary with that of fuel oil, at first based on Dollars 0.90 per 1,000 cu ft at the wellhead, and Dollars 1.22 at the border. The deal may help Brazil shift from dependence on poor-quality oil for making electricity. Most of the Bolivian gas will power part of the industrial and domestic demand for electricity in Sao Paulo. Those worried about pollution from burning oil with high sulphur content to make electricity favour the gas alternative. Gas use by Sao Paulo industry is set to reach 35m cu m by the year 2000, possibly heralding a gas deal between Brazil and Argentina, which has an estimated 60bn cu mts of natural gas in its Salta reserves. For Bolivia, the deal could not come quickly enough. It was hard hit by the fall this year in the price of its gas sales to Argentina. British Gas in Kazakhstan, see Commodities page

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexican meat could be Caribbean poison - Canute James on concerns that Mexico's presence in Nafta will undermine the region's economies 
text:  THE agreement which will link Mexico's economic destiny to that of its US and Canadian neighbours to the north is being regarded with more than slight discomfort by the countries in the Caribbean Basin. For the past year, there has been little doubt in the minds of Caribbean and Central American trade ministers that the region will be hurt by Mexico being part of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both the Canadian and US governments have been petitioned repeatedly to ensure some form of preferential treatment for the region. Mr Brian Mulroney, Canadian prime minister, on a recent visit to Trinidad, offered countries in the region some comforting words: 'The Caribbean countries will lose nothing but there will be greater competition in the North American market. What we would propose is to evaluate any impacts after a reasonable time, see what they are and, if there are any, try to accommodate them in meetings with the Caribbean leaders.' The problem for the region is based on the fact that, for many years, it has survived through trade preferences. Most recently, 24 Caribbean and Central American countries have been benefiting from the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), a trade programme offered by Washington, which selects countries which may ship a range of products to the US duty-free. Several countries also benefit from a similar programme offered by Canada, while others have preferential access to the European Community market under the Lome Convention. Mexico in Nafta threatens to remove the advantages of preferential entry to the US and Canada because small regional economies cannot compete with Mexico. Business leaders and government officials in the region say they are already seeing the effects of Mexico's participation in Nafta. Investment decisions were delayed as the negotiations for Mexico's entry went on. 'The US is not yet willing to consider the likely impact of an expanded Nafta on the Caribbean Basin states, but says this will be reviewed in four to five years,' says Ms Judith Bennett, a promotions officer with Jampro, Jamaica's economic development agency. 'But, during this period, the Caribbean states will lose a large part of their industries, particularly agriculture and garments.' The region has made much of opportunities to expand exports of garments to the US in recent years. Although not allowed duty-free access under the CBI (a concession to the fears of the US domestic industry), countries in the Caribbean and Central America have been granted quotas under a programme in which US-made fabric is cut in US plants and then sent to the region for assembly, with duty paid on the added value on re-entry to the US. The countries which have benefited from this Dollars 2bn-a-year industry have asked Washington to ensure that they are allowed duty-free entry to the Nafta when Mexico becomes a member. 'If this does not happen, then we can tell this industry good-bye, and face the political price of the anger of the hundreds of thousands of women who work in the factories,' said one official from the Dominican Republic. The region's sugar exporters have also been worried at reports that Mexico could ship 1.5m tonnes of sugar a year to the US. This would amount to more than current US imports under quotas from 44 countries, many in the Caribbean. There is general agreement in the region that one way to control the damage would be to join forces. But, for the Caribbean states, such co-operation has always been slow and difficult. Mr Norman Garca, executive director of Fide, the Honduran export development agency, says the start of the Central American common market in January will allow its members more strength in dealing with Nafta. This should be followed by discussions with the Caribbean islands to create a wider economic union, he suggested. 'We must either get out of the way of Nafta, or follow,' Mr Garca said. 'We must follow Nafta. We have no alternative. The Caribbean Basin countries must first get together, and then talk to Nafta.' Mexico is expected to be admitted to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation group (Apec), the 15-nation regional economic consultative body, officials at the South Korean foreign ministry said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. A ministry official said no objections to Mexico's membership were expected at the group's fourth ministerial meeting in Bangkok on September 10-11. Apec is made up of Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, the US, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei.

text:  THE Bank of Portugal said yesterday it had cut its intervention rate by one percentage point to 16 per cent for lending to commercial banks, Reuter reports from Lisbon. This second sharp cut in a month of the country's key interest rate follows last week's central bank announcement that all remaining controls on capital movements would be lifted by the end of 1992. Economists agree that the three-stage lifting of restrictions on capital movements was bound to lead to a sharp fall in Portugal's high interest rates. Mr Jose Tavares Moreira, who ended a three-year term as Governor of the Bank of Portugal in May, predicted on Monday that borrowing rates for good risk companies would fall four to five points to about 13 per cent by the end of this year. The governor, Mr Miguel Beleza, declined to quantify the expected fall, but said Mr Tavares Moreira's estimate was 'probably not far out.'

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / Industrial production in France falls 0.4% 
text:  FRENCH industrial production fell by 0.4 per cent in June, according to official figures, underlining the sluggish state of the economy. The main reason was the poor performance of the energy and construction sectors, where output fell by 1.37 per cent and 4.76 per cent respectively. By contrast, output in the manufacturing sector fell only 0.08 per cent. The June fall followed one of 1.6 per cent in May. Many of the largest French industrial companies - including the Suez industrial group, Thomson-CSF in electronics, Publicis in advertising, Pernod-Ricard in drink and Lafarge Coppee in building materials - have recently announced reductions in interim turnover. The decline in production is also reflected in rising unemployment and a fragile stock market. The CAC 40 Index fell again yesterday, for the second successive day, having fallen for most of last week, to close 0.14 per cent lower at 1,734. France's current account deficit fell to FFr1.92bn (Pounds 200m) in the first half of this year, its lowest level for six years, according to the finance ministry. This is compared with a deficit of FFr31.11bn in the equivalent period of 1991. The June deficit shrank to a seasonally adjusted FFr4.39bn, against a revised figure of FFr9.1bn for May.

headline:  FT  20 AUG 92 / Weekend 'Chetniks' on the warpath: Should Nato be fearful of military involvement in Yugoslavia? 
text:  THROUGHOUT the capitals of western Europe, an unequivocal consensus has emerged over the past week: Europe must not get involved in the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. In London, Paris, The Hague and Rome, defence ministries and senior officers have repeatedly warned their governments that any large-scale military involvement in Bosnia would incur a high financial and human cost. Western governments are even reluctant to provide any substantial military support to protect aid convoys. Moreover, the idea mooted at last month's Geneva conference on refugees concerning the establishment of security corridors in Bosnia has now been abandoned, as confirmed by Mr John Major, the British prime minister on Wednesday night. Such deep reluctance begs the question of why western governments are so in awe of the Serb military machine in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Officials at Nato yesterday tried to explain Europe's reluctance to become involved. 'First, Nato is not ready for such an operation. We have not fought in any war. But second, leaving aside the terrain, we don't know what kind of army, or how many armies we would be fighting in Bosnia,' a Nato official said. The Serb army in Bosnia inherited at least 500 artillery pieces, 300 tanks and 40,000 soldiers from the former Yugoslav army. It also took over an indigenous defence industry in Bosnia, a communications network and a senior officer corps handpicked by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. One of the key army commanders in Bosnia is General Ratko Mladic. As former commander of the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina, western Croatia, Gen Mladic helped to organise the Serb insurrection against the Croats in 1991. But four weeks after the European Community recognised the independence of Bosnia-Hercegovina last April, Mr Milosevic ordered Gen Mladic to take command of Sarajevo. 'This is the man who controls the formal army units,' a UN official based in Belgrade said. 'This is the man you negotiate ceasefires with.' However, Mr Charles Meynell, editor of the London-based East Europe Newsletter, says the former JNA units exist uncomfortably alongside bands of thugs and irregulars. 'Much of the professional officer corps of the JNA, including the most influential Serbian generals - many of whom have resigned - were, and are aghast at the mixture of Serbian hoodlums, criminals and 'Ramboesque' drug-taking delinquents who have been so prominent in the ransacking of Bosnia,' says Mr Meynell. The low morale among sections of the army is partly confirmed by the recent resignation of Major General Vuk Obradovic, once considered a 'hard-nosed' loyal Serb nationalist. 'This is a measure of how disreputable the Serbian military machine has become,' added Mr Meynell. Apart from the army and the irregulars, parts of Bosnia is overrun by 'weekend Chetniks.' Between Fridays and Sundays they cross the river Drina from Krajujevac, Nis and Valjevo in Serbia, and from Montenegro. Those captured say they have been paid DM500 a day for fighting in Bosnia. 'These guys are well fed, nationalist and ready for a weekend's fight,' said a UK Ministry of Defence adviser. 'They wreak havoc.' But what is the combat effectiveness of such a two-tiered force? 'If you look at the way in which 45,000 Croat troops, managed to push back the Serb army from Mostar (the capital of western Hercegovina, in western Bosnia) between late May and early July, it begs the question why a combined western force cannot take on the Serbs in other parts of Bosnia,' a western military attache said. A Nato official noted that 'The army is good at bombarding. And they still have the air-power. But it has no infantry. Look at how long it took them to flatten Vukovar? (the eastern Croatian city ). In some ways, apart from Mostar, the army, or the irregulars for that matter, have never been really tested,' he said.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A hard game to join 
text:  FORECASTS that a work revolution in the 1980s would leave half the UK's employed population beavering away behind computer screens in their own homes not only proved hopelessly exaggerated but also under-estimated the psychological difficulties of earning a living in the isolation of a private house. 'Working alone at home is very hard, the hardest thing about what I do,' says Michael Seal. 'When I can, I will move into a studio where there will be some inter-action with other people.' Seal designs and makes games from the living room of his flat in Brighton and suffers from the familiar headaches of under-capitalisation and competition from large companies with muscular promotional budgets. 'I often find that shops do not want to take a game that does not have a large amount of advertising behind it.' Seal studied architecture at Brighton Polytechnic but found designing factory units for industrial estates was not intellectually stimulating. Seal, who is 32, had long been interested in geometry, the relationships between shapes and ancient Egyptian architecture. Artefacts in his living room include a large propeller blade and a bullet-shaped fan. One wall is made of a bookcase he built with a secret door and mock temples pillars. In 1988 Seal designed a game called Altar. He cordoned-off part of his bathroom as a workshop, constructing moulds out of card and wax for the pieces and hand-carving the wooden board for the game which has some similarities to chess. His company, Seventh Seal, started selling the game in local design shops and to the game shop chain of Virgin, to which he had shown a prototype. A local company he found in Yellow Pages produced the fibre-glass resin pieces while Seal made the boards. He learnt screen-printing and packaged the product in the flat. The game was ready in December of that year and for Christmas Seal generated a turnover of just Pounds 500, selling games retailing at Pounds 30 and costing about Pounds 8 to make. In 1989, Seal fitted kitchens and constructed furniture to make a living while he designed a new game, Axiom, which is now his main bread-winner. This is a three-dimensional game made of cubes shaped with hollows and bulges and, like Altar, is based on strategy with no element of luck. Seal says turnover, largely from this game, has risen from Pounds 4,000 in 1989 to Pounds 20,000 in 1991 and about Pounds 30,000 last year, during which he sold some 2,000 Axioms. This turnover is generated from selling to shops at half the retail price of Pounds 20 and to direct customers at a Pounds 2 discount from the retail price. Direct sales are mainly at the Camden open-air market in London, a weekend stall costs Pounds 60 to rent. Seal, though, finds the business a struggle and not just because of the recession. 'The game looks strange because there is no board and it can appear very complex even though it is quite easy to learn.' The packaging was a mistake: a slight upright box. 'That did not make it look like a Pounds 20 game. I've re-designed the packaging now so it comes in a flat box and looks much more substantial.' Using Yellow Pages, Seal picked toy, gift and design shops around Britain, visiting them to demonstrate the game. Reactions were often less than positive. 'The Virgin people were very nice and took the game but some shop managers will not sell games unless those games have big advertising budgets. I was in one shop and a customer came in to buy a football and bought the game there and then right under the nose of the manager. But the manager still wouldn't take it.' Seal's operation is too small to take advantage of cheap manufacturing in the far east. 'It costs Pounds 2.50 here to have all the plastic pieces made for one game of Axiom. I had a quote from Hong Kong to do all those pieces for 33 US cents but we are not big enough to use that. Large game makers can get their products made for virtually nothing and spend a large part of their sales on promotion.' He advertises little except in the 'house' magazine of Mensa. Sales in the UK are not as good as Seal hoped but two German businessmen who saw Axiom at Camden last year have bought 600 to sell in Germany and have been discussing a joint venture in which they would sell the game in continental Europe. 'Germans are big buyers of thinking abstract games, much bigger than in the UK, so I have been hopeful about this.' Seal has been approached by a large British games maker interested in buying the rights to Axiom. This would scupper plans for a tie-up in Germany. But, the terms the suitor has offered so far are not satisfactory. Seventh Seal is also about to market a puzzle. All Seal's income now comes from the business but it is only generating a very moderate living for its owner. Seal would like to devote all his time to designing games, leaving production to someone else. He also contemplates the possibility that he might be forced to return to architecture.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / As They Say In Europe: Germany yearns for realpolitik - James Morgan detects envy for Britain's policy of self interest 
text:  THIS IS the time of year when we look to new beginnings, prospects seem brighter. The Easter message of 'cheer up' makes tentative inroads on today's all-enveloping gloom. But even so, the bleakness of the European situation renders it hard to sustain even a seasonally adjusted upsurge of optimism. Fortunately the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung is there to show us that many mountains may be no more than molehills. And its readers help out in this endeavour. Thus a Herr Klaus P Lucke wrote to the paper the other day about the situation in the former Yugoslavia. He had noted that the attempts of the German army to intervene in the local crisis of 1941 had often been portrayed in an unfavourable light. The Germans had, it was generally alleged, bitten off more than they could chew. But, wrote Herr Lucke, 'The Yugoslav campaign did not last even two weeks. On the German side there were only 151 losses to complain about. The French historian, Raymond Cartier wrote in his standard work, The Second World War, that this campaign occasioned 'fewer losses than a single weekend on the roads of Europe at peace'.' The lesson is clear and I expect you are feeling better already. But in the German press anything that cheers is counterbalanced by a searing attack on what the naive might have supposed to be a promising development. Thus the agreement of last weekend between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin occasioned some incoherent reflections from an embittered Hamburger Abendblatt: 'The DM2.56bn approved by President Clinton is in fact nothing more than the famous drop in the ocean when set against the 80bn Bonn has shovelled into the East. But then the Americans did not lose the second world war . . . Secondly in the USA there are no CIS soldiers for whose removal Bonn would pay any price (sic). And third Washington is four times as far from Moscow as is Bonn and is not so afraid of the collapse of the democracy movement as is Germany.' These long extracts highlight a problem facing western Europe today - what is Germany for? The old West Germany had a clear role: a milch cow, an Aunt Sally to be knocked down by references to its unsavoury predecessor and a good friend in time of need. A mammoth Switzerland in human form. Now that the time has come for a bit of self-assertion, the traditions of more than 40 years forbid it. Geopolitical ambition degenerated into farce in a constitutional court case which was supposed to resolve the question, 'should Germans fly over Bosnia?' Always a tricky question, and the future of the government could hang on it. But this kind of strife is a bit odd in a country which would like to be a permanent member of the Security Council where macho self-assurance used to be a necessary if not sufficient condition of membership. So it was that the FAZ had another good ruminate about German power. It quoted the British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd enviously: 'British foreign policy has the task of protecting and promoting British interests. In spite of the changes in the world nothing has changed this basic truth. The question of what are British interests must be answered anew by each generation.' The FAZ noted that this was a classic 'national-state declaration' and added: 'It is hard to imagine such a policy statement coming from the mouth of a German Chancellor.' I tested this view on a number of Germans, handing them the German text and putting deutsche in place of britische. The consensus was that the statement had been either a sober assessment of reality on the part of Bismarck or a drunk one from the lips of the present foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel. All agreed that no German politician could speak of the country's national interests without the addition of some rambling Euro-rhetoric, but that Germany was gradually moving towards a position where a Bismarckian statement could be made, and never mind foreign wincing. The Frankfurter Allgemeine added its bit of Euro-rhetoric, emphasising that Germany's prosperity depended on the Community's markets. But what Germany suffers is by no means unique. In spite of the bold clarity of Douglas Hurd's statement of principle, there is no clear view in any large country about the definition of its 'national interest.' In the old days, if it was only natural for Germany to attack Serbs, it was also right for the French to help the Serbs. The British would check to see whose victory appeared the less desirable and come down on the other side. The US would see profitable opportunities in keeping out of trouble while the Russians reckoned on consolidating their hold on anything they could grab. Those old certainties may have been flawed, leading to world wars and suchlike, but at least we knew where we were. Today's generation, in Britain especially, would be no better off than the Germans in agreeing on a clarion call to mobilise the nation. I propose, 'Half a treaty is better than a strong pound.'

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Computing For Investors: The playful way to do your accounts  -Jean Miles tries finance programs and learns to love mice 
text:  I CAN summon the necessary stoutness of heart to deal with a flesh-and-blood mouse, but I have not had the same success with the ones attached to computers. Mice are an almost invariable accompaniment of the Windows operating system. Windows is a program to be run before you run any other program. It needs a lot of computer memory and a lot of disk space. It has little pictures, called icons, for you to click at with your mouse. With Windows, you can run several programs at the same time. Windows does seem to be the signpost to the future. I swallowed my scepticism and looked at three finance programs for Windows: Microsoft Money, a Windows program tout court; Quicken for Windows, brother of a DOS program; and Sage Moneywise, which comes with the DOS and the Windows versions in the same box so you do not have to decide until you get home. I have written about Quicken (for DOS) before as a home budget program. But I use the phrase 'finance program' this time because Money and Quicken are also something else, new in Britain: serious accounting programs for people who think they do not understand accounting. Moneywise, on the other hand, is unashamedly a computerised cashbook, part of the traditional double-entry book-keeping system. Money and Quicken are US imports, carefully converted; Moneywise is a British program. The basic structure of all such programs is the same. You define the accounts in which your money resides. As sums arrive and depart, you assign each transaction to one or more income or expense categories: salary, interest earnt, electricity, mortgage, whatever. Quicken and Money allow subcategories, which can be included or 'hidden' in your financial reports. If you are registered for VAT, each of your categories can have a VAT code and transactions will then automatically, in all three programs, be broken into Net and VAT amounts. Quicken and Money can suppress this feature. Moneywise enforces VAT tracking until you figure out how to turn it off. In Money and Quicken it is possible to assign a transaction to a class or a subclass as well as to a category or subcategory. The mind begins to boggle, although it is straightforward in practice. All US budget programs assume (interestingly) that you are likely to own or manage rental property: assigning transactions to classes lets you view both income and expenditure property-by-property. The system also has its uses if you want to break things down by client, by job, or by project. Quicken and Money both let you fiddle with categories, subcategories, classes and subclasses, after you have started using the program, changing the names, merging categories, reassigning transactions. Moneywise enforces proper standards of accountancy. No change can be made once a transaction has been 'posted'. I had to install the program from scratch several times because it refused to allow me to redeem the mistakes made in setting up my accounts. It is the freedom to shape the program to your purposes which is the novel element in Quicken and Money. Gone are the formal constraints and the terminology of accounting. But programs can still handle accounts receivable and accounts payable. Aged debtors (I love that phrase) can be identified. Quicken is the better at predicting cash-flow. Half the point, and more than half the fun, of Windows programs are the graphics. Moneywise is restrained, offering only bar or line graphs comparing actual, budgeted, and last year's expenditure. Both Money and Quicken offer a rich variety of line, bar, stacked bar, and pie charts. In Money, you call up charts as a visual representation of a financial report, once you have tweaked the report to your liking. All those categories and classes provide a lot of scope for designing and filtering reports. Quicken does things the other way around: you specify a chart, then click on a particular section of it to see the underlying figures. By this stage I was having a lot of fun with my mouse. Best of all was Quicken's iconbar, a row of coloured pictures across the top of the screen, providing quick access to various aspects of the program. You can choose icons yourself and assign them to actions you use frequently. I found an icon of a cash dispenser and set it up to open my cash account. This may cut as much as a second from the time otherwise taken in choosing that account, but that is not the point. What did I conclude? Moneywise did not seem a good choice for private accounts. It is a program for small business cash accounting. There were features I liked, including the feeling of rugged reliability. A club treasurer bowed down by a sense of responsibility for other people's money might welcome the constraints this program imposes. Quicken and Money are both very usable, similar in concept, and as suitable for private accounts as for small businesses and the self-employed. I prefer Quicken. Both have good manuals, but Quicken's is fuller. Money will not print your cheques or monitor your portfolio; Quicken will. VAT tracking is more sophisticated in Quicken. it will calculate VAT on transfers between accounts. And in Quicken you can customise the iconbar. All three programs require an IBM-compatible computer running DOS 3.1 or a later version and Microsoft Windows. The prices below include VAT.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tokyo breathes again - But will the market revival continue? 
text:  THE TOKYO stock market, which seemed only last year to have nowhere to go but down, has revived. The Nikkei 225, which in August reached a low for the decade of 14,929, peaked briefly above 20,000 this week. For non-Japanese investors, the strength of the yen has given an extra boost to returns. The Japanese market was up 18.6 per cent in dollar terms in the first quarter of 1993, making it the best-performing major market bar South Africa. Over the year to April 6, the rise in dollar terms was 42.3 per cent. For UK investors, the effect of September's devaluation, makes the rebound even more dramatic. Since the Nikkei's low in August, the index is up around 89 per cent in sterling terms. The average Japanese unit trust rose 38.2 per cent (offer to offer with income re-invested) over the six months to April 1, according to Finstat. But the market continues to trade at only half its level at the start of January 1990. So, private investors should be asking: is the rally set to continue, or have those who buy now missed the boat? Ian Burden, who manages the James Capel Japan Growth fund - second in the sector over 10 years, with a rise of 483.9 per cent - says the rebound 'feels completely different from any of the bear market rallies we have had over the past few years. The authorities are moving to a much more pro-active and aggressive policy stance.' He points to the speed with which the 1993 Budget was passed. 'The Japanese economy is in severe recession, but fiscal policy is being used quite aggressively and there has been a gradual improvement in liquidity.' Burden adds: 'The stock market will be an initial beneficiary of any short-term growth in liquidity, just as in the US when interest rates fell sharply and investors moved out of cash and into equities. There has been encouraging anecdotal evidence that the domestic individual is coming back into the market.' That move could be echoed by foreign institutions, Burden feels. 'Since Japan has been something of a one-way bet for the past three years, many US and European investors have been underweight in the area.' Burden warns, however: 'The news on the economy and earnings is still poor and I am not expecting any really good news on earnings until the period September 1993-March 1994. What the market is doing now is anticipating that 1994 recovery.' John Wright manages the Stewart Ivory Japan fund which, Finstat shows, is top of the sector over 10 years with a return of almost 500 per cent (offer-to-bid with net income re-invested). 'The general expectation was that the Japanese government would help the market ahead of the March year-end when banks have to value their equity holdings,' he says. 'Nevertheless, the fundamentals of the market are not that lousy. The country can take stimulative measures without putting the Budget into deep deficit, and inflation is very low.' One factor that always puzzles the overseas investor is that Japanese shares tend to trade on very high price-earnings ratios. In the mid-1980s, Japan bulls argued that these were irrelevant to Japan, where accounting standards are different. The cynical saw that as the kind of argument that can be self-deluding, and the 1990 decline as a come-uppance for those who choose to ignore fundamentals. Early in the 1990s, the problem has not been that share prices are high but that earnings have fallen dramatically. According to Datastream, the p/e ratio on the Japanese market is 49 now. If UK shares ever reached that rating, most sane investors would be heading for the exits. Wright says Japanese companies are often 'not run for bottom line earnings per share, but for market share and volume.' He points out, though, that there are important valuation measures other than the p/e ratio: 'Japan is cheaper than the UK and the US on a price to cashflow basis.' A further important factor is that the very low interest rates of the 1980s encouraged Japanese companies to splurge on capital spending. This hits earnings by increasing the depreciation charge. But capital spending now is dropping sharply. This will reduce the depreciation charge and allow earnings to recover. P/e ratios may start to fall. So, will the market move ahead once more? Wright fears there could be a correction once the Nikkei 225 moves into the early 20,000s. He thinks a more major move could depend on confirmation that corporate earnings are improving; like Burden, he believes this might not happen until late this year. Ken Inglis, group investment director at Allied Dunbar, says: 'It is reasonable to assume there has been some sort of sea change in attitude towards Japan. The market has reached the end of a long dark tunnel, and it is encouraging for western investors to see that the banks are not leading this rally.' He feels that, though the rise will not be continuous; the market has further to climb.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Joanna romps in as top adviser - A fee-based IFA has won a top contest 
text:  ATTEMPTING to assess financial advisers is not easy. They specialise in different areas and have to deal with people whose personal finances often differ radically. But a reliable system for judging the quality of advice is central to any reform of the UK's financial services. The IFA of the Year competition, run by the magazine Money Week, has made such an attempt. Advisers were given detailed case studies of households and required to produce a 2,000-word report recommending how best to manage their personal finances. The winner was Joanna Stone, who works for the fee-charging adviser Murray Noble. The case study she was set, and her response, showed just how complex personal financial planning can become. Her case was that of Mr and Mrs Robertson, aged 41 and 40, with children of 16 and 13. The couple's annual incomes were Pounds 30,000 (including Pounds 7,000 in bonuses) for him and Pounds 20,000 for her (including Pounds 3,000 in bonuses). Both belonged to the company pension scheme, and the family carried private medical insurance. Most of the income was spent right away, due to mortgage payments of Pounds 1,050 a month and school fees of Pounds 7,000 a year. But the Robertsons did have assets, including a French cottage and a share portfolio valued at around Pounds 10,000. They had asked for advice simply to assess their position. They believed their budget to be very restricted, with no more than Pounds 100 a month to spare. While nothing much rings alarms bells there, Stone found several areas where she felt the Robertsons needed to alter their finances radically. She said the big problems were the school fees and the mortgage, which was not protected by life cover, and she set out a plan to re-arrange the family's cash flow. In descending order of importance, the key aspects were: Agree a new budget and finance structure Stone spotted that the Robertsons had an outstanding balance of around Pounds 10,000 on various credit and store cards. This is a ruinously expensive form of debt, and she pointed out that it was worth selling the equities to repay the card bills. (An equity portfolio would have to be chosen exceptionally well to manage a growth rate greater than a credit card interest rate). She also suggested that they should rent their property in France for Pounds 4,000 a year. These two acts increased greatly the income available for spending each month. She also recommended forming a profit-related pay scheme into which the bonuses could be paid tax-free, and taking out a fixed-rate mortgage. All of this would allow the Robertsons a sizeable cash reserve. Arrange for further life cover Stone looked at what the company pension scheme guaranteed and found Mrs Robertson's annual income would increase by only Pounds 8,000 after her husband's death while her debts would increase by Pounds 6,389. So, she suggested the family take out a protection policy to cover its Pounds 160,000 mortgage (at a cost of around Pounds 50 a month), plus term cover of Pounds 120,000 for Mr Robertson to last until age-65 (costing about Pounds 54). She also suggested Mrs Robertson take out term cover (at Pounds 24 a month) to cover her until age-60. Replacement income Stone worked out that if both could not work because of temporary or permanent illness, their disposable income after 12 months (when their employer's sick pay arrangements ran out) would be Pounds 5,777 a year. So, she proposed that both take out permanent health insurance which would start paying them an income once they had been unable to work for 12 months. (This time lag kept premiums much lower than if the income payments began earlier). Total annual premiums would be Pounds 500 (Pounds 700 if they wanted inflation protection). Once this groundwork was in place, Stone suggested the couple build up a cash reserve and then invest in a regular savings scheme (probably the National Savings Yearly Plan), making occasional contributions to a larger portfolio when finances allowed. What made Stone's work stand out? According to Keith Popplewell, who set the case studies: 'The poorer candidates concentrated too much on the clients' need for death benefit. This 'need' may not exist in practice beyond cover for the mortgage and credit card balance . . . Surely an equal or even greater need is for permanent health insurance, a possibility left relatively unexplored by some entrants.' His final comment was telling: 'To suggest, as many candidates did, that the expenditure saved could be invested in monthly savings or pension plans was, in my opinion, misguided. The immediate need for these clients was protection.' Stone's employer, Murray Noble, charges fees but not commission. Thus, it has no incentive to force clients straight into a high commission-bearing savings plan based on life assurance. Amanda Richards, editor of Money Week, said the remuneration side was very attractive, adding that the magazine had received many strong entries from commission-charging advisers. But the award must cast doubt on the complaint, made often by advisers, that customers will not pay a fee. Murray Noble seems to charge them without difficulty, and the evidence of this competition is that customers get good value for money.

However, this residential assessment is due to be reconsidered in April 1993 when we expect to be treated as no longer resident. Both of us have several Peps taken out over a number of years. What will be the position when our situation changes and we are no longer required to pay tax in the UK? Will these investments in Peps be allowed to continue or must they be liquidated? All that happens (under regulation 8 of the Personal Equity Plan Regulations 1989) when a Pep investor ceases to be both resident and ordinarily resident in the UK is that he or she is not entitled to put any more cash into any Peps.

text:  I HAVE JUST received a dividend from Euro Disney sent by the National Westminster bank. They say the form claiming a French tax refund should be completed in quadruplicate. Does this mean I should send four forms to the NatWest and one to the inspector of taxes in this country? Also, in claiming back the French withholding tax, it seems I shall lose a percentage of it. How much will actually be sent to me and my wife? Finally, do I claim the full amount that is on the dividend slip, as the shares are held jointly with my wife? She is a 25 per cent taxpayer and I am a non-taxpayer. Send all the completed copies of the form RF4-GB to your tax office. The inspector will complete his part, keep one copy for his file and send the others back to you; you should then send them back to the bank. You will be paid the 50 per cent avoir fiscal (tax credit) plus 2.5 per cent out of the 25 per cent withholding tax; so, ultimately, you will bear 22.5 per cent French withholding tax - which is equivalent to 15 per cent of the dividend-plus-avoir fiscal. As a basic-rate taxpayer, your wife ultimately will bear UK tax at 10 per cent on the dividend-plus-avoir-fiscal, so she will end up with 75 per cent of the dividend-plus-avoir-fiscal (subject to the variation in the exchange rate between the time the dividend was converted to sterling and the time when the payment from the French government arrives). A joint claim by your wife and yourself will probably be acceptable to the French tax authorities. If your wife's tax affairs are dealt with at a different tax office from yours, however, it might may be simpler to ask the bank for another form so that each of you can submit a claim in respect of your half share of the dividend.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Income lure in new bond 
text:  GUARANTEED equity bonds have offered little so far to investors who want income. Now Acuma, the financial planning arm of American Express, has devised a new product to meet that gap - the Fixed High Income bond. The key to this offer is that Acuma has chopped up the income and capital elements in a new way. After five years, basic-rate taxpayers are assured of a minimum capital return which, in addition to the income received, gives them back their original investment. That is the same guarantee as on a conventional GEB - the return is just offered in a different way. Getting only your money back after five years is not much of a deal - the capital will have declined in value in real terms and you will have missed the interest you could have earned in the building society. What is needed to make the bond worthwhile is a rise in the stock market: the capital repayment level is linked to the FT-SE 100 index. But investors need to know what they are doing when they buy this bond. Three levels of income are offered - 10, 9 and 7.5 per cent (these are paid net of basic rate tax; higher rate taxpayers may face an extra charge). The higher the level of income you choose, the more the FT-SE 100 will have to grow to repay your capital in full, as well as earning the income. An example might help. If you invest Pounds 10,000 (the minimum is Pounds 5,000) and opt for 10 per cent income, you will get Pounds 1,000 a year in income for five years, or Pounds 5,000 in all. If the FT-SE 100 does not rise at all over the next five years, or falls, you will receive Pounds 5,000 of capital back in 1998 to take you back to your original Pounds 10,000. The FT-SE 100 would need to rise 10 per cent a year in order for you to get back all your capital plus the income on top (so your overall gain would be 50 per cent). If you opt for the 9 per cent income, return of capital depends on 8 per cent growth in the Footsie; at 7.5 per cent income, the Footsie needs to rise at only 4 per cent a year. These are not overly demanding rates of return - in the five years to end December 1992, the index rose by 10.7 per cent a year. But you would not get more than your original capital returned. And, as with other GEBs, you do not benefit from the yield on the Footsie. All this makes it a difficult product to assess. It is an odd hybrid of equities and cash. Even a 7.5 per cent income is highly attractive at present interest rates, and it would be reasonable to expect the 4 per cent annual rise in the Footsie needed to get your money back. But if the market climbs substantially, you would do better to buy most conventional GEBs - and even better to buy an indexed unit trust, such as Gartmore's. And if the market falls, you will be better off in the building society. The lure of the income offered could attract many investors to Acuma, but they should be aware of the risks.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES; cause for anxiety 
text:  THE DUST is still settling on the most tempestuous year for the business expansion scheme. Now, it starts its last nine months before being abolished at the end of 1993. Total investment in BES companies more than doubled, to Pounds 957m, in the 1992-93 tax year compared with Pounds 367m in 1991-92, according to figures from the Allenbridge group. In many cases, last year's investors will have received excellent deals. But they have cause now to be anxious that the sponsors who put these together did not take any short cuts with the paperwork involved. The Inland Revenue gives every impression of having lost patience. This might be because the BES has lost touch with the high-risk start-up companies it was supposed to help. Allenbridge's figures show that only Pounds 7m went to trading companies last year, the worst level since the BES began. But assured tenancies took Pounds 950m, of which Pounds 880m went to schemes with contracted exits. In three separate cases, tax inspectors have laid down a strict interpretation of BES rules and are threatening to deny relief. These cases are: Johnson Fry's schemes, launched just before last year's general election, which bought accommodation for University College, London. The schemes had not received provisional approval and the Revenue believes regulations may have been broken because the accommodation was let to conferences during the summer vacation. Loan-back schemes launched before the Budget by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and the National Westminster bank. Each scheme took Pounds 25m and allotted shares before the deadline, but the Revenue is not convinced the shares were issued correctly to shareholders in time. Country Gardens, a series of trading companies which raised Pounds 15m under the BES in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Investors have been asked by the Revenue to return their tax relief with interest. Inspectors decided the companies were in technical breach of regulations by operating a non-qualifying subsidiary and holding too much money in cash. These episodes suggest that investors should avoid sponsors which lack experience, or schemes that stretch the rules. But what are the prospects for supply over the rest of the year? The abolition of non-recourse loans has not damaged the economics for building societies of using the BES for repossessions - it remains cheap finance for them. But the lack of a quick exit route means societies would have to be prepared to raise money over several months, which makes the BES less attractive. The Halifax is now unlikely to use the scheme. It points out that raising funds this way is too complex, although it is still considering the BES as an option. But the Building Society Association disagrees, and there will be plenty of repossessed housing available to BES companies for the rest of the year. Investors have another problem. The issues are confused this year because the BES season will end with the calendar year, not the tax year. An imminent deadline could allow intermediaries to hurry investors into making decisions, but it would be wise to resist the pressure. If you do not know how much top-rate tax you would need to pay for the 1993-94 tax year, you should err on the side of caution.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Throgmorton's painful fightback - Investment Trusts 
text:  THROGMORTON is an example of an investment trust that lost its way in the 1980s. According to Micropal, it has been one of the 20 worst performers over the past five years, with a fall of 14 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income re-invested). Admittedly, Throgmorton specialises in a sector - smaller companies - which has been battered by recession. But consistently its long-term performance is below the sector average: 11th out of 16 over 10 years, 14th of 18 over five, and 15th of 19 over three. The big problem has been ventures into outside areas, especially property. The chairman, Lord Stewartby, says: 'The strategy is to get the trust back to basics. During the second half of the 1980s, it increased debt in order to acquire extraneous interests. A lot of activity is devoted to disengaging from those areas.' This policy has taken longer than expected to implement. A joint venture with Cussins Property took a year to unravel and required Throgmorton to accept property assets in settlement of debts. Some of that property was sold in 1992, and the trust hopes to dispose of more in 1993. On the house-building side, disposals have taken time because, as Stewartby explains: 'You can't sell half-developed sites.' Even unwinding an investment in art dealer Arthur Ackerman has left Throgmorton with Pounds 1m worth of residual stock in pictures. The stake in fund management group Framlington has been cut gradually to 49 per cent via the sale of two tranches of stock to French bank Credit Commercial de France. The remaining holding was valued on November 30 at Pounds 27.9m. The best news for the trust, however, is that there are signs of a revival in both smaller company shares and its own relative performance. Over the year to April 1, the trust's investors enjoyed a gain of 32.7 per cent, placing it sixth out of 24 funds in the sector. It takes time for a trust to recover from a problem period, though, particularly as the dividend was nearly halved at the end of 1990. Although some smaller company specialists trade at a premium to net assets, Throgmorton shares trade at a 21 per cent discount. Throgmorton was founded in 1957 and named after its headquarters in Throgmorton Street, close to the Bank of England. It has always specialised in smaller companies and has a sister trust, Throgmorton 1000, which looks at companies even smaller than the main trust will consider. Its present manager is Sally Hepher, a 30-year-old Oxford graduate who managed funds at Barings before joining Framlington in 1990. She stresses that management is a team effort, and has seven others to help her. The trust defines smaller companies as those with market capitalisations of under Pounds 200m. Hepher says she is looking for good-quality companies which can produce above-average growth in turnover - organically as well as by acquisitions - in profits, earnings, retained earnings and dividends. She says she is optimistic about the prospects for smaller company shares, as they are relatively more exposed to the UK domestic economy which, she feels, is improving. 'The companies we invest in have done a great deal to control costs,' says Hepher, which leaves them well placed to gain from the economic recovery. The 10 largest stocks are Framlington, Davis Service, Throgmorton 1000 Smaller Companies, Watson &amp; Philip, Senior Engineering, John Waddington, More O'Ferrall, Trinity International, Frost Group and Suter. Some legacies of the past remain for Hepher to overcome. One storm cloud hanging over the trust has been Pounds 58m of convertible stock issued in 1988 and 1989. Conversion into shares will be profitable once the share price gets above 108p; unfortunately, with the shares trading now at around 58p, that prospect looks a long way off. What makes it worse for Throgmorton is that the stockholders have a put option, giving them the right on April 30 to redeem the convertible at 117.5 per cent of par. It became clear some time ago that many might well take up that option. landing Throgmorton with a hefty bill. The news is not all bad. Throgmorton has been accumulating reserves steadily to try to meet the liability. Furthermore, some stockholders acquired the convertible as part of the consideration for acquiring Framlington. Realising the convertible for cash would land them with a hefty capital gains tax bill. To solve their problem, and help itself, Throgmorton has proposed issuing new stock at 117.5 per cent of the previous par value but with the same coupon. For those who do transfer, this means a 17.5 per cent increase in income. Holders of Pounds 13.5m of stock have agreed already to accept the new securities and Throgmorton hopes more will do so. For the others, it has arranged a Pounds 30m bank loan to meet the redemption cost. It plans to repay that by selling its remaining property and unquoted interests. Once the loan is out of the way, might a revived Throgmorton be an interesting play on the small companies sector? After all, few trusts can be bought on a 20 per cent-plus discount these days. Robbie Robertson, of NatWest Securities, thinks there is an optimistic case for the trust. 'So many of the things that gave the trust a complex structure are beginning to sort themselves out,' he says. The convertibles will be replaced by cheap borrowings and warrants will be exercised. Framlington's funds under management are rising and the property issue is under control. What will be left, says Robertson, is one of the larger trusts devoted to smaller companies. Key facts Net assets per share are around 74p. That puts the shares, at 58p on April 6, on a discount of 21 per cent, according to NatWest Securities. The dividend yield is 5 per cent and the annual management fee around 0.93 per cent. Board The chairman, Lord Stewartby, was economic secretary to the Treasury from 1983 to 1987. Other executive directors are Peter Courtney (finance); Paul Loach (managing director of Framlington) and Brian Rout (managing director of the property subsidiary). Non-executives are Sir Victor Garland, a director of the Prudential; Richard Good, also chairman of Throgmorton Dual; Michael Orr, chairman of Molins; and Michael Windsor, executive chairman of Horstmann Group. Savings scheme and Pep details The minimum monthly investment in the savings scheme is Pounds 25, or Pounds 250 for a lump sum. There are no dealing charges. The trust qualifies for full Pep status but no specific plan is linked to it.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Prolific offers Pep bonus - News in Brief 
text:  PROLIFIC is offering a 1.25 per cent bonus on lump sum investments made into its unit trust personal equity plans. The offer applies to plans taken out between April 6 and June 1. Switching costs between unit trusts within the Pep have also been lowered, with a full discount of the manager's initial charge available. Save &amp; Prosper is waiving its initial plan charge on its all-share Peps, the Managed Portfolio and Dealing plans, for those who invest more than Pounds 4,000 before the end of May. It is also offering a 2 per cent discount on its unit trust Pep (the effect is to cut the initial charge from 5.5 to 3.5 per cent) on the same terms. ***** NATIONAL &amp; Provincial building society is offering a range of fixed-rate mortgages over periods from one to five years. Rates vary from 5.95 per cent (8.2 per cent APR) for two years (on loans no greater than 60 per cent of a house's value) to 8.5 per cent (9 per cent APR) for five years on loans of up to 95 per cent of valuation. Arrangement fees are Pounds 200 or Pounds 250, depending on term; redemption penalties are 90 days' interest (for loans over one to three years) or 120 days' interest (for loans over four and five years). Building and contents insurance must be arranged through N&amp;P. The rates are available on all types of mortgages. Midland Bank is offering rates linked to endowment and pension mortgages only. The two-year rate is 6.99 per cent (APR 8.2 per cent) on an arrangement fee of Pounds 195. The five-year rate is 7.95 per cent (8.4 per cent) for a fee of Pounds 250. The redemption penalty is six months' interest, or three months if there are fewer than two years left before the end of the loan. ***** SCARBOROUGH building society has launched Young Super Saver, an account which pays up to 8 per cent gross to those under 18. The minimum investment is Pounds 10. Between Pounds 10 and Pounds 99, the return is 5 per cent gross (3.75 per cent net); between Pounds 100 and Pounds 249.99, 5.8 per cent gross (4.35 per cent net); between Pounds 250 and Pounds 499.99, 6.8 per cent gross (5.1 per cent net); between Pounds 500 and Pounds 999.99, 7.3 per cent gross (5.48 per cent net); and between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 5,000, 8 per cent gross (6 per cent net). A new account called Top 20 is on offer from Norwich &amp; Peterborough BS. Withdrawals are subject to 20 days' notice, or 20 days' loss of interest. The minimum investment is Pounds 10,000. Investments above that and below Pounds 25,000 will receive 5.75 per cent gross (4.3125 per cent net); the top rate is 7.05 per cent gross (5.2875 per cent net) on investments over Pounds 100,000. ***** THE INSTITUTE of Financial Planning, which promotes professional, fee-based financial advice, has launched its first financial planning examination. Successful applicants can use the exam as the final step towards gaining associate membership of the IFP (becoming an AIFP). In future, consumers will know that anyone with these letters after their name has passed two three-hour 'open book' written examinations, working on case studies of fictitious people and business situations. The range of the syllabus is broad, including banking, cash investments, credit and mortgages, tax planning, pensions, annuities, trusts, and types of investment for both lump sums and regular savings, including investment planning. Candidates will also need to be able to write reports and use financial calculators.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Societies battle First Option 
text:  BUILDING societies are trying to fight back against the competitive threat offered by the First Option bond from National Savings, which is offering 6.34 per cent gross (4.75 per cent net) to those who invest Pounds 1,000 for a minimum period of a year. That return is beaten by the Portman society, which is paying 6.5 per cent gross (4.875 per cent net) for investments of more than Pounds 500. The rate is guaranteed for a year. Meanwhile, the Better Option bond from Bristol &amp; West, available from April 13, will guarantee 6.75 per cent gross (5.06 per cent net) for a year on deposits of more than Pounds 5,000. On amounts over Pounds 25,000, the bond will pay 7 per cent gross (5.06 per cent net); the First Option will pay 6.74 per cent gross on investments of more than Pounds 20,000. Some societies have warned that if First Option draws away their deposits, they will have to raise savings rates to compete. If that happened, mortgage rates would have to increase as well. But Ken Culley, Portman's chief executive, said: 'Both my own society, and others, are demonstrating that we are able to continue to offer attractive rates of return to savers, and talk of rising mortgage rates at this stage is premature.' A different fixed-rate option is available from Bristol &amp; West. Its escalator bond, available to those with Pounds 5,000, pays a rate of interest which is guaranteed to increase every year for five years. In the first year, the annual rate is 7 per cent gross (monthly 6.79 per cent); the second year 7.5 per cent (7.25 per cent monthly); the third year 8 per cent (7.72 per cent); the fourth year 8.5 per cent (8.19 per cent); and the fifth year 9 per cent (8.65 per cent). There is no early access, except in the case of the investor's death. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is closing its Best 90 account to new investors from April 17. The account guarantees to pay the highest 90-day rate of any top 10 building society (plus Abbey National) on amounts of Pounds 10,000, Pounds 25,000, Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 100,000. The guarantee extends until May 1994.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Irish Life strikes a blow for industry reform - The company will now not offer combined savings and life insurance products 
text:  IRISH LIFE made a small but significant breakthrough for reform of the life insurance industry this week. From now on it will not offer combined savings and life insurance products. Customers can buy both at the same time if they wish and combine them with one payment for extra convenience, but the costs of the two will be itemised and kept separate. This makes good sense. Savings and life assurance are different needs and it is unlikely that many people will need to do both at once. If you only need to take out insurance for your family in case you die, there seems little point in saving any extra. The approach does not sound revolutionary, because it keeps up the standard industry practice of using an irritating brand name. But behind the 'Total Quality Lifestyle' range of life and savings products lies some potential good value. How could the approach save you money? Irish Life provide the following example for a 30-year-old man who wants to cover his life for Pounds 250,000 for the next 20 years. Under a standard flexible whole of life policy, which includes an investment element, Irish Life says this would cost Pounds 307.65 per month for 20 years (assuming the fund grows at 7.5 per cent, and that the cover is indexed at 5 per cent annually). Using standard Lautro illustrative growth rates, this would produce a fund value of Pounds 154,000 on growth of 7 per cent, and of Pounds 315,000 on growth of 10.5 per cent. This sounds like an adequate deal. However, under the new TQL system, Irish Life would ask for life assurance premiums of only Pounds 54.95 per month, to cover for 20 years. If our 30-year-old also wanted to save then he could, if he wanted, put Pounds 252.70 towards the TQL Savings contribution and still pay the same as he would have done in total premiums under his flexible whole-of-life contract. Using the same Lautro assumptions, this would grow to Pounds 179,000 on growth of 7 per cent - 16 per cent more than the Pounds 154,000 from the whole-of-life policy. On a growth rate of 10.5 per cent the gain is even more pronounced - Pounds 379,000, an advantage of 20 per cent. Unbundling life assurance is not easy, and Irish Life's new 'Total Quality Lifestyle Account' includes three forms of assurance, two forms of term insurance and two savings plans. Contributions in each area are analysed and priced separately. However, the convenience of keeping the disparate elements under one heading, often touted by life insurance salesmen, is maintained by allowing all three elements to be administered under one account number using one direct debit and one administration fee. According to Tony Dallison, marketing manager: 'One of the common complaints from clients is that the product they purchase cannot change with their circumstances, or that if it can, there is a heavy penalty charge. This is no longer the case.' Irish Life should not be judged on its new improved structure alone. Ultimately, its products must stand on the cheapness of the protection premiums and the strength of its investment performance. It is likely that you will be able to get better value by shopping around. But the move does make life assurance easier to understand, and makes it harder for less scrupulous sales agents to sell people products which they do not need. It is also timely, as the Office of Fair Trading recommended last month that insurance companies should be forced to reveal what proportions of life premiums went towards investment and assurance. The life assurance industry has not yet made a detailed response to the proposals beyond claiming that the OFT's figures would be difficult to calculate. This is particularly the case for with-profits contracts, where investment profits are added via arcane annual bonus systems and do not fluctuate with a unitised fund. Life assurance is an integral, although minor, part of endowment policies, which offer life assurance but also pay out at the end of a fixed period even if you are still alive. The sum you would receive on death increases during the life of the policy, in line with investment returns. The exercise of separating life cover from the rest of the investment proved difficult for all the large endowment providers contacted this week by the Weekend FT, and different actuarial assumptions may have been used. They were asked how much of the Pounds 30 monthly premium paid into an endowment policy by a 29-year-old man would go towards life cover. Commercial Union reckoned that Pounds 1.20 from each premium would be needed to pay for the life cover. Standard Life reckoned on 80p for a 10-year policy, and 95p for a 25-year policy. GA Life estimated the cost at 55p per month. The Prudential was unable to produce a figure, although the company emphasised that it was quite prepared to disclose it - the problem was making the complex actuarial calculations involved. Legal &amp; General refused to disclose the information on grounds of business confidentiality. The Office of Fair Trading provided an example of the disclosure it would like to see from a good company, and estimated that life cover would cost Pounds 18 each year out of total premiums of Pounds 600 - or Pounds 1.50 from Pounds 50 premiums. A message common to all was that endowments should always be treated as investments. That is why the OFT wants life offices to disclose the same information for endowments as they do for unit trusts, which have no life cover element. In the meantime, Irish Life's exercise should make life assurance easier to understand, while allowing customers to shop around. Will other companies follow its lead?

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: EZTs shunned 
text:  ENTERPRISE Zone Trusts turned into the twilight zone last year. Only Pounds 43.2m was invested in them in 1992-93, compared with more than Pounds 160m in 1991-92. This may seem strange, as the tax relief on EZTs is generous - you are entitled to relief at your top marginal rate of tax, without any upper limit, on investments in enterprise zone property. Tax relief is available on loans taken out to fund the property, and rental income is also tax-free. However, commercial property is inflexible and presently ravaged by a slump in prices. The tax rules governing EZs are tortuous. These factors have forced down the demand for EZTs. According to Ian Pugh, of the Allenbridge Group, unresolved issues also dented confidence. Problems interpreting the rules for apportioning a value for the land on which the property is built, on which tax relief is not available, forced many trusts to wait as long as a year before the value of their tax relief was known. The Concept Regional Portfolio trust, sponsored by the solicitors Neill Clerk, fell foul of an Inland Revenue attack on the rental income stream it has arranged for investors to receive while the properties are being built. Negotiations are continuing, but investors meanwhile soldier on without their tax relief. Hardly surprising: the Revenue can only be expected to be indignant about paying tax relief on an income derived from a building which has yet to be built. However, investors should not rule out EZTs altogether, particularly as the BES is to be phased out at the end of the year. Some trusts had a solid structure, offered good value, and sold out quickly this year even without the benefit of publicity. But investors must also have learnt that this is a dangerous market. Opportunities exist, but nobody should try to take them without taking professional advice.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: AVCs; a guide to investment performance - Philip Coggan crunches the numbers on an annual survey of pension arrangements 
text:  BACON &amp; WOODROW, the actuarial group, has published its annual survey of additional voluntary contribution (AVC) pension arrangements. The survey compares the actual returns offered by various contracts of the with profits, unit-linked and building society varieties. The results are designed to be useful to those in company pension schemes who are paying into AVCs which operate on a money purchase basis - where the final pension depends on the investment return. The figures shown are for a person with a normal retirement date of January 1 1993 and use actual interest and bonus rates and expenses. Contributions have been assumed at Pounds 600 per annum, payable monthly. Returns for with profits contracts are shown both with and without the terminal bonus, which can be highly volatile. (The aim of a with profits policy is to smooth returns. Annual bonuses are added each year and cannot be withdrawn; terminal bonuses, however, are more dependent on investment conditions at maturity.) As the tables show, if terminal bonuses are ignored, only a very few insurance companies are able to match building society returns. Reductions in bonuses mean that the returns on with profits contracts have generally been lower than last year. Returns on unit-linked contracts have increased, however, to reflect good investment performance. However, Bacon &amp; Woodrow does not believe that its five year embargo on with profits personal pensions, should also be used in this area. Members of company pension schemes may well value the security on offer from the with profits policy; investment return may be a less important factor. Two further factors should be noted on with profits plans. Some companies offer special terms (ignoring commissions) which can enhance the returns shown in the table. On the other hand, some with profits contracts impose early retirement penalties, resulting in less competitive returns if the policy proceeds are taken before the retirement date specified in the contract. Bacon &amp; Woodrow adds: 'It is clear that insurance companies are continuing to move away from conventional with profits contracts. Several have replaced their conventional contract with a unitised with profits arrangement and an increasing number of companies are also offering funds which are directly linked to the underlying investments.' Few unit-linked plans have been in existence for 10 years, so Bacon &amp; Woodrow has not produced figures for that duration. However, it does have unit-linked figures for seven years; over that period, they lag behind with profits returns. The leading unit-linked fund outperforms only three of the with profits funds over that period. Bacon &amp; Woodrow cites the Prudential as the company with the best with profits record which is still marketing an AVC policy in that form. Among the unit-linked funds, Gartmore was the leading provider over three years and National Mutual over five years. Among building societies, Northern Rock and the Nationwide respectively led over five and ten years. The actuarial group concludes: 'We advise trustees and employers to review their AVC scheme regularly, looking not only at past performance but also at the standards of service received, and the provider's financial position and prospects.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BUILDING SOCIETY SCHEMES Contributions paid over 10 years to January 1 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Cash       Equivalent annual                          Accumulation          rate of return                                Pounds             % per annum  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nationwide                     11,305                    12.4 Coventry                       11,303                    12.4 Northern Rock                  11,288                    12.3 Bristol &amp; West                 11,273                    12.3 Woolwich                       11,255                    12.3 Abbey National                 11,212                    12.2 Halifax                        11,186                    12.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WITH PROFITS INSURANCE SCHEMES Contributions paid over a 10 year period to January 1 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          LAUTRO Terms                          Excluding terminal bonus                               Cash          Equivalent annual                       Accumulation             rate of return                             Pounds                % per annum  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CIS                         11,371                       12.5 Norwich Union               11,041                       11.9 Prudential                   9,970                       10.0 Standard Life               10,323                       10.6 Sun Alliance                10,924                       11.7 Eagle Star                  13,445                       15.6 National Mutual Life        10,291                       10.6 Equitable Life               9,731                        9.5 Friends Provident           10,043                       10.1 Scottish Equitable           9,829                        9.7 Britannia Life              10,960                       11.8 London Life                 10,418                       10.8 Legal &amp; General             11,786                       13.1 Scottish Mutual             11,619                       12.9 Scottish Widows              9,799                        9.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          LAUTRO Terms                          Including terminal bonus                               Cash          Equivalent annual                       Accumulation             rate of return                             Pounds                % per annum  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CIS                         16,498                       19.5 Norwich Union               14,977                       17.7 Prudential                  14,371                       16.9 Standard Life               13,473                       15.7 Sun Alliance                13,551                       15.8 Eagle Star                  13,445                       15.6 National Mutual Life        13,790                       16.1 Equitable Life              13,772                       16.1 Friends Provident           13,110                       15.2 Scottish Equitable          12,877                       14.8 Britannia Life              12,648                       14.5 London Life                 12,915                       14.9 Legal &amp; General             12,748                       14.6 Scottish Mutual             12,302                       14.0 Scottish Widows             11,824                       13.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Research - the key to success - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains how he picks profitable shares . . . and some that aren't - Diary of a Private Investor 
text:  THE MAN at the boring cocktail party was disbelieving. 'Are you really Kevin Goldstein-Jackson?' he asked, I felt like replying: 'No. I am really Zarg from the planet Jupiter,' but I resisted the temptation. A few minutes earlier, I had been accosted by a woman who said: 'Oh] You do exist. I thought Kevin Goldstein-Jackson was all made up by journalists.' Once people are convinced I am not a product of someone's imagination, they tend to ask if the things I write about in Diary of a Private Investor are all true. Can I give them some hot share tips and how do I find out about companies before I invest in them? The answers to all these questions are comparatively easy. My brief for this column always has been to write about things that have happened (or are happening) to myself or my family. If I say I have had a particular investment experience, then it is true. The good experiences (like buying shares in NMC for 12.5p and selling them for 205p, or seeing certain shares double in price within a year) are just as valid as the bad experiences (like buying 1,500 shares at 300p in Gresham House Investment Trust for my personal pension scheme and seeing them fall to 8p). Under the Financial Services Act, I am unable to give people specific investment advice other than in the pages of approved publications such as the Financial Times. I cannot give people specific advice (like 'hot' share tips), either in person or by letter. Someone once said to me: 'I like to do what you seem to do. Walk around watching what people are buying. Trying to spot the next trends. But if you see a particular product that is selling well, how can you find out who made it so you can buy shares in the company? Even if there is a manufacturer's name on the product, that manufacturer might, in these days of multi-national corporations, be owned by another company - so how do you find the name of the ultimate owner?' In such cases, I go first to my local reference library and look at Who Owns Whom. This is a series of separate weighty volumes covering the UK, Europe, North America, Australasia and the Far East. It lists many thousands of subsidiaries, with details of their parent companies. If Who Owns Whom cannot provide the answer, then I might ask British Telecom's directory enquiries service to provide me with the number of the company named on the product so I can ask it directly. If the product is made overseas, then I try to find a friendly shop assistant who can tell me the name of the UK distributor. Sometimes, of course, the product is made by a private company and shares in it cannot be bought. Or the product comes from a public-quoted company which, for one reason or another, I would not touch with a barge pole. I also subscribe to Campaign, the weekly magazine for people in the advertising industry. It can be found in many public libraries and is very useful for giving advance notice of new-product launches, with details of the advertising agencies concerned and the makers. In previous FT articles, I have described a number of the things for which I look in a company before I invest. But to find many of those items (like details of directors, profits records and debt levels), I use three publications produced by Hemmington Scott Publishing of City Innovation Centre, 26-31 Whiskin Street, London EC1R 0DT. The most useful is the Hambro Company Guide, published every quarter; an annual subscription costs Pounds 99. It is also available, at a higher charge, on computer disc. The guide gives profits' records and other information about each UK-quoted company. The Arthur Andersen Corporate Register is published twice annually and costs Pounds 150 a year. This gives much more detailed information about directors  -very useful when I want to know the name of a company secretary to contact in order to get the annual report. It includes each company's address. The third Hemmington Scott publication is the Performance Rankings Guide, also published twice annually, for Pounds 135 a year. This, as its name implies, grades companies by a wide variety of criteria: from earnings per share based on a five-year trend, to profit margins within certain sectors. Many companies use the FT's Annual Reports service where, for the cost of a phone call, a reader can get a free copy of any of the reports produced by the participating companies. Details are given on the newspaper's share price pages. I have found this service to be fast and efficient, and the line is open 24 hours a day. Another useful publication is the Estimate Directory, obtainable from Edinburgh Financial Publishing, Freepost, Edinburgh EH3 0EN. This is published monthly and an annual subscription costs Pounds 350. But you can buy four issues - one sent each quarter - for just Pounds 120. The directory is quite new. It started in March last year and collects a wide variety of stockbrokers' estimates for the profits and earnings per share of many quoted UK companies. It also contains details of major shareholders, and a brief outline of the company's main activities. In future, whenever I am depressed about poor performance from a share I have selected, I will turn to the mid-February 1993 issue of the directory and look at the entry for Queens Moat Houses. It tells how, earlier this year, well-known brokers with highly-paid analysts were predicting profits for the company of Pounds 85-90m. I did not buy shares in Queens Moat. I had read the receivership sales notices in the FT and noted there were a lot of hotels for sale at quite low prices (including some well-known names). So, why did anyone think Queens Moat would perform well when, clearly, conditions were tough? Some people expect me to sit behind a flickering computer screen full of information. I think that is the quickest way not to see the wood for the trees - too much information can be just as damaging as too little. But, as well as the reference books mentioned earlier, I also have a large number of company reports plus a collection of press cuttings from the FT and other publications - especially the weekly Investors Chronicle. The cuttings all relate to particular companies in which I have money already or am monitoring for possible future investment. I also keep copies of the FT's share price pages for the last trading day in each year so that I can look back on the annual share price highs and lows for each company. As much as anything, I like to walk around in the real world, getting a 'feel' for a product, a company or a trend. Any private investor can do the same: it does not require any special skill or super-intelligence. I am just an ordinary person who wins sometimes and loses at others. So long as the profits are more than the losses, I will continue doing it my way.

text:  WITH the financial crisis at Queens Moat Houses still not fully explained, the rest of the hotel sector is being closely watched. Forte reports full year results next Thursday, with the City expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 70m, compared with Pounds 73m last time. Some expect the group to cut its 9.91p a share dividend. If it does, criticism is likely to be muted, with many regarding a cut as evidence of financial sobriety. The group is likely to be pressed on whether it would be interesed in any of Queens Moat's Continental properties, should these become available. Blue Circle Industries and RMC Group will bring more news on Thursday about the building materials sector. The former, with about half the UK cement market, is expected to report pre-tax profits for 1992 of about Pounds 85m, down sharply from Pounds 124.2m a year earlier. There is some question hanging over its 10.9p a share dividend. RMC, benefitting from its extensive German operations, is likely to report profits down only slightly from 1991's Pounds 167.4m. Laura Ashley, the international fashion and furnishings group, is set to report a return to the black on Thursday after three years of losses. It may also pay a final dividend. A revitalised performance in the UK and continued growth on the continent should enable the group to report a Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m pre-tax profit for the year to January.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Lynch's golden rules for investors 
text:  THE FOLLOWING is a selection from Peter Lynch's golden rules for investors. Your investor's edge is not something you get from Wall Street experts. It is something you already have. You can outperform the experts if you use your edge by investing in companies or industries you already understand. Owning stocks is like having children - don't get involved with more than you can handle. The part-time stockpicker probably has time to follow eight to 12 companies, and to buy and sell shares as conditions warrant. There do not have to be more than five companies in the portfolio at any one time. If you cannot find any companies that you think are attractive, put your money in the bank until you discover some. Never invest in a company without understanding its finances. The biggest losses in stocks come from companies with poor balance sheets. Avoid hot stocks in hot industries. Great companies in cold, non-growth industries are consistent big winners. A stock market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado. If you are prepared, it cannot hurt you. A decline is a great opportunity to pick up the bargains left behind by investors who are fleeing the storm in panic. Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach. If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic you ought to avoid stocks and stock funds altogether. Nobody can predict interest rates, the future direction of the economy or the stock market. Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what is actually happening to the companies in which you have invested. If you study 10 companies, you will find one for which the story is better than expected. If you study 50, you will find five. There are always pleasant surprises to be found in the stock market. If you do not study any companies, you have the same chance of success at buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at your cards. Time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies. You can afford to be patient.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Wise words from a stock-picking guru - Philip Coggan reviews the investment wisdom of ex-Magellan boss Peter Lynch 
text:  PETER LYNCH might not be a name that is familiar to private investors in the UK. But in the US, he is a stock market legend because of his success in running Fidelity's Magellan fund. When he started to manage the fund in 1977 it had Dollars 18m in assets. By the time he retired in 1990 it was worth Dollars 14bn. Much of the increase came from money raised from new investors; nevertheless Dollars 1,000 invested in the fund in 1977 was worth Dollars 28,000 by 1990. The benefit of Lynch's wisdom is now available in a new book* which will give a lot of encouragement to private investors. He sincerely believes that private investors can beat the market by doing the right kind of research. A bright and breezy writing style makes the book an easy read for anyone with an interest in stock market investment. Scattered through the pages are Lynch's one-liners, or Peter's principles, such as 'Never invest in any idea you can't illustrate with a crayon', or 'All else being equal, invest in the company with the fewest colour photographs in the annual report.' But it would be wrong to suggest that the book is a succession of homilies. There are plenty of practical examples of how Lynch goes about selecting individual stocks. Some of the lessons are peculiar to the US - for example, his enthusiasm for shares in the frequently despised savings &amp; loans (the equivalent of the British building society). Ironically, the one stock he chooses from the UK - Body Shop - is one of his few mistakes. It has fallen by a third since he first recommended it in early 1991. Investment managers tend to be classed in two camps. The 'growth' investors are those who look for companies with good businesses and a long record of profit increases. A classic growth stock would be Glaxo, which until recently seemed to move only one way - up. Its shares may have looked expensive on a price-earnings ratio basis but that did not seem to matter. In the 1980s, it was always a good time to buy Glaxo shares. The opposite school is that of 'value' investment. These managers look for stocks which have fallen out of favour with the market and thus trade at very cheap prices. A good recent example of this in the UK was Next. It was one of the glamour retailers of the 1980s but its stock plunged following the departure of founder George Davies. New management has turned the company around - the shares have risen tenfold over the last 27 months. Both schools have their flaws. Even the best managed companies cannot grow at 30 per cent per year for ever. If a stock is trading on a high p/e, then the fall in the share price can be precipitate when the company starts to falter (Glaxo has fallen by a third since its peak in early 1992). And the market is often right when it hammers the shares of companies - the value investor can find that some of his picks go bust. Lynch takes an eclectic approach which uses both the value and growth philosophies. He is really searching for 'tenbaggers' - companies with the potential to give tenfold returns. But he can find those among restaurants and retailers as well as in fallen angels such as the early 1980s Chrysler. His biggest single profit came from the unglamorous Federal National Mortgage Association. He describes how, when he is looking for retailing stocks, he heads to his local shopping mall. 'I don't think of it as browsing,' he writes, 'I think of it as fundamental analysis on the intriguing lineup of potential investments, arranged side by side for the convenience of stock shoppers. If you like the store, chances are that you'll love the stock.' To give all amateur investors hope, he cites how a group of 12- to 13-year-olds at St Agnes School in Massachusetts produced a portfolio which rose 70 per cent over two years, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and 99 per cent of all equity mutual funds (the US equivalent of unit trusts) in the process. Those children picked the stocks in companies they knew such as Nike training shoes, Pepsi and the Gap (where most bought their clothes). At St Agnes, the pupils recite the lesson 'you should invest in several stocks because out of every five you pick one will be very great, one will be really bad and three will be OK.' Lynch argues that 'an amateur who devotes a small amount of study to companies in an industry he or she knows something about can outperform 95 per cent of the paid experts who manage the mutual funds, plus have fun in doing it.' The most useful section of the book is probably the part where he explains how he selected the 21 stocks which he recommended to readers of Barrons magazine in January 1992. Over the next 14 months, despite the odd dud such as Body Shop, those stocks rose by an average 61.7 per cent, according to USA Today. The S&amp;P 500 Index was up just 9 per cent over the same period. An example of his reasoning was his selection of General Motors, a company which seems to have had nothing but bad news over recent years. It reported a Dollars 23bn deficit for 1992, the largest loss in US corporate history. As Lynch writes, the general perception was 'powerful enterprise forgets how to make cars, loses the public's confidence, lays off thousands of workers, heads for the scrapheap of has-been corporations.' 'It was all this negativity about GM that attracted me in 1991' adds Lynch. After looking at the third quarter 1990 report, he noticed that GM's other divisions, such as Ross Perot's old company, EDS, were doing well. 'If the company can only break even on the US auto business' he reasoned 'it could earn Dollars 6 to Dollars 8 a share in 1993. Giving these earnings a p/e ratio of 8, the stock should sell for Dollars 48-Dollars 64, a big advance from the current price.' Since he made his selection, GM shares have risen 24 per cent to Dollars 38-plus, well ahead of the market. Simple, really. * Beating the Street by Peter Lynch with John Rothchild.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home cover rates soar 
text:  THIS WEEK'S news that Abbey National is to increase its premium rates for home contents insurance by some 37 per cent is considerably less dramatic than it might appear. Abbey National, the country's second biggest mortgage lender, sells insurance on behalf of a panel of three insurers - Commercial Union, Royal Insurance and Legal &amp; General - and said that it was increasing rates because domestic theft claims had gone 'through the roof.' It announced on Tuesday an average increase of more than 26 per cent in rates for 1993. Some customers could also pick up an additional rise of 10 per cent announced in December last year, taking their total increase to 37 per cent. But these were the first increases by Abbey for more than two years, during which time insurers have increased premiums by an average of 40 per cent - a rise which is itself dwarfed by the increase in the cost of theft claims. The cost of theft from homes has increased by more than 200 per cent since the end of 1989, to Pounds 749m in 1992. Last year alone theft costs rose by 27 per cent according to figures released last month by the Association of British Insurers, the trade association. 'Theft losses have reached epidemic proportions. In this environment it is not surprising to see vigorous rating action taking place,' said John Chester, an analyst with SG Warburg, in a recent note by the securities house. Although UK insurers saw their results improve in 1992, only two of the leading six non-life companies - Commercial Union and Guardian Royal Exchange - registered profits. In 1990 and 1991 the six companies lost more than Pounds 2bn and saw their financial strength severely eroded. Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, another securities house, said: 'People just have to look at the claims costs. Looking at the results that the companies produced last year you can hardly argue that people are being ripped off.' Not surprisingly, few observers are quibbling with the need for rate rises, but some suggest that the industry may not be doing enough to isolate the highest risks and that the increases are being unfairly charged across the board. 'Everyone is suffering from the poor experience of the few,' said Peter Friend, of brokers Leslie &amp; Godwin. Friend suggests that insurers ought to evaluate the risks of individual householders more carefully and tailor premiums to individual risks. Leslie &amp; Godwin already does this for their wealthier customers, through its Artscope International scheme. Insurers have already begun to be more discriminating. They began to charge higher rates for residents of inner city areas and other 'high risk' areas some years ago. Premium rates now vary widely according to post code. In addition, a number of insurers are offering discounts to householders who instal good quality locks or reliable alarm systems and join police-approved Neighbourhood Watch Schemes. 'We are very keen to reward customers who take a responsible attitude to protecting their homes and strongly believe in helping them fight crime,' said Brian Richards, personal insurance development manager at Norwich Union. But Friend still says they could do more, by, for example, taking into account factors such as occupation, level of occupancy and 'lifestyle'. 'The fact is that a couple without children who are out all the time are more likely to suffer from thefts,' he says. Already there are signs that some in the industry may be taking the hint. Direct Line, the insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, which insures 250,000 householders, says that it is reviewing its rating structure and could announce changes later this year.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Tesco lays an egg in the City - The Bottom Line 
text:  LIKE THE frustrated buyer played by Dudley Moore in its TV advertisements, constantly chasing chickens without ever catching them, Tesco, the supermarket chain, must be wondering just what it has to do to please the City. For most other companies, a 6.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 580.9m during a recession - the figures reported by Tesco this week - would be impressive. Moreover, the operating margin rose from 7.1 to 7.6 per cent, while operating profits were up 14 per cent, reflecting its ever-increasing efficiency. But after nine years of pre-tax profit increases of between 19 and 43 per cent, the latest figure represented a significant slow-down and did little to boost Tesco's shares which are about 60p below the 293p they reached a year ago. Tesco has undergone quite a transformation since the 1970s, when it was a sprawling mass of mainly small shops. In the 1980s, it moved towards value-added retailing from large superstores. Profits leapt from Pounds 176m in 1986 to Pounds 545.5m in 1991, and Tesco was established, together with J Sainsbury and Argyll, owner of Safeway, as one of the UK's most powerful and sophisticated food retailers. Then, last year, things started to go slightly awry. Food retailing shares were hit by the realisation they were not immune from recession. Tesco suffered particularly from rumours that its newly-opened stores were trading below expectations. With store developments costing up to Pounds 35m, and high fixed operating costs, any shortfall in the computer-projected sales volumes can have serious consequences. Tesco strongly denied those rumours again this week. David Reid, finance director, said that its newest stores were exceeding their targets, and many had already reached a creditable Pounds 14.50 of weekly sales per square foot. Most important, Tesco was still making a return on investment of about 19 per cent from new stores. But analysts point out that that compares with the 24 or 25 per cent return achieved by Safeway, whose developments tend to be smaller and cheaper. More recently, the City began to worry about poor sales growth in Tesco's older stores. That was something this week's figures could not hide. Subtract the 7.5 per cent accounted for by new stores, and the 2.4 per cent by food price inflation, from the total sales increase of 9 per cent, and it turns out that 'like-for-like' sales - those at existing stores - fell by 0.9 per cent. That compares with small increases in like-for-like sales at Sainsbury and Safeway. Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman, says the poor performance is due to 'trading down' by its customers, who, as mainly younger people in metropolitan areas, have been hit harder by the recession than those of its rivals. The big question is whether they will ever trade back up again. Some analysts fear Tesco customers are the most susceptible to the growing discount sector - cut-price stores such as Kwik Save, Aldi and Netto. That may be why Sir Ian was keen to stress that Tesco would launch tactical price promotions in areas where it competes against discounters, and would continue to offer lesser-known 'tertiary' brands of 70 to 100 of the most popular products at prices that match those of the discounters. Tesco's expansion efforts are no longer going solely into superstores. It is experimenting with a smaller city-centre format, Metro. It has also dipped its toe into the water in Europe, with the Pounds 175m acquisition of Catteau, a 90-store supermarket chain in northern France. But such experiments have been seen by some, perhaps uncharitably, as further evidence that all is not well with Tesco's superstore programme. As Paul Smiddy, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, put it: 'The City will need to see a sustained period of like-for-like sales growth before it alters its view on Tesco.' If a consumer upturn does occur, Tesco should be a recovery stock, but the City prefers Argyll, whose store portfolio and customer base are seen as the safest of the three majors. In spite of its strength, it may be some time before Tesco catches its chickens.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Cigarettes burn top-brand consumer stocks - Wall Street 
text:  WALL STREET'S love affair with brand-name consumer stocks ran on to the rocks this week. On Monday and Tuesday, heavy selling hit a wide range of consumer issues which, in turn, lopped a few points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The spark for the sell-off was the surprise decision by food and tobacco group Philip Morris to cut the price of its top branded cigarettes, Marlboro. in an attempt to win back customers lost to cheaper brands. Investors were unnerved by the move because it showed thatan industry-leading company recognised that top-brand goods can lose market share to much cheaper brandless products. For the best part of a decade, investors have supported brand-name consumer stocks on the premise that these companies could maintain earnings growth by raising the prices on their best-known products - which, supposedly, were immune from competition from discounters because massive promotion and a strong, well-established image had guaranteed consumer loyalty. However, recent experience with the world's best-selling cigarettes, seems to have shattered that illusion. With smokers switching from Marlboro to discounted generic brands in increasing numbers, Philip Morris was forced to do something to stem its loss of market share. Other than spending even more on advertising and promotion, its only choice was to cut the price of Marlboro. This momentous decision left investors reeling: if it could happen to Marlboro, arguably one of the world's most famous products, it could happen to any other brand name. Consequently, they wasted no time in selling stocks such as Colgate-Palmolive, Heinz, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kellogg, Campbell Soup and Coca-Cola. So unsettled were investors that they unloaded a wide range of consumer-related stocks including retailers such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Sears, Roebuck. Wal-Mart appeared to be a particularly unfortunate victim, given its remarkable recent earnings growth and solid prospects. However, there was some logic to the sell-off. Wal-Mart's February same-store sales figures were disappointing; Home Depot was looking extremely expensive with a price-earnings ratio of almost 60; and Sears' shares had enjoyed an excellent run of late on recovery hopes and were probably due to take a breather. Such explanations aside, however, the heavy selling still was unnerving. The brand-name consumer stocks and fast-growth discount retailers have been a mainstay of the market for years. Any substantial reversal in this stalwart group could mark a big turning point in the market's longer-term prospects. Fortunately, when investors rushed out of consumer stocks, their money did not leave the market altogether. Funds were switched to other sectors. This week, it was the turn of cyclicals, cars, timber and transportation stocks to benefit. Cyclicals were an obvious choice for investors suddenly disenchanted with consumer stocks. The economy continues to grow at a solid, if unspectacular, pace and the likes of Caterpillar, International Paper and Alcoa should churn out good earnings over the next year or so as the pace of business activity across the country, and eventually overseas, picks up. Likewise, car-makers. Over the past few months, there has been a growing feeling of confidence in the big three - a sense that all of them have turned a corner. It is no surprise that, as of Thursday, Ford shares were standing at a 52-week high while Chrysler and GM were within spitting distance of similar peaks. While forestry product stocks may have been something of a cyclical play, they drew most of their strength this week from the so-called 'timber summit' meeting in Oregon between the logging industry and environmentalists, chaired by a consensus-seeking President Clinton. Although the summit failed to heal the divisions between the two sides, investors were cheered by reports that the president probably will avoid any initiatives that might depress timber industry profits. Finally, airline stocks had an excellent week. All the major carriers posted big gains, in the process lifting the Dow Jones Transportation Average to a record. Several factors were behind the buying. One was United Airlines reporting a 17.4 per cent jump in March passenger traffic and also announcing big cuts in capital spending. There was also news from Washington DC that a joint committee of congressional and presidential experts is to investigate ways to help the industry survive its seemingly never-ending crisis.  -------------------------------------------- Monday          3379.19   +    8.38 Tuesday         3377.57   -    1.62 Wednesday       3397.02   +   19.45 Thursday        3396.48   -    0.54  --------------------------------------------

The amount raised by trading companies fell to Pounds 29m the next year, rose to Pounds 36m in 1989-90, and then fell to Pounds 10m. Meanwhile, the totals taken by the scheme have risen steadily as sponsors squeezed out still more risk. One of the scheme's starting aims was to foster the entrepreneurial spirit, and it seems to have failed. See BES: cause for anxiety, Page VI

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Markets: Coming to terms with the Hillary factor - London 
text:  WHAT HAS happened to the Wellcome share price over the past month is a case of the market kicking a company when it is down. The shares were over 930p in mid-March. Yesterday, they closed at 700p, a drop of 25 per cent. There are three forces at work, all negative. First is the cloud hanging over the sector as a whole, personified by Hillary Rodham Clinton. She is drafting the blueprint for the promised US health care reforms; significantly, US health care stocks reached their peak, relative to the market as a whole, in the first weeks of 1992 just as Bill Clinton's campaign for the presidency started to look credible. Even without political impetus, drug prices face downward pressure as insurers, employers and health systems round the world become increasingly reluctant to write the industry a blank cheque. The result is poor performance by drugs stocks, worldwide. During the first quarter of 1993, the healthcare stocks covered by the FT-Actuaries World index have dropped 10 per cent in local currency terms, while the world index as a whole has risen 4 per cent. Within the UK, fears about pricing are not the only factor affecting the sector. A second influence is the shift by investors out of defensive stocks and into cyclical ones, as the economic upswing begins. Pharmaceuticals companies are classic defensive stocks - steady demand, pricing protected by patents and regulations, a growth path dictated by what comes out of the labs rather than what is in the customer's pocket. As the economy dived into recession, the big internationally minded UK drug stocks  -Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - benefited hugely from their defensive status. As demand picks up, though, steady earnings growth looks dull by comparison with recovery stories. Companies in the sectors most affected by the economic cycle stand a chance of doubling or tripling their earnings overnight; drug stocks do not. The relative performance of the health and household sector of the FT-Actuaries All-Share, dominated by the big drugs stocks, shows how this works. In the first half of 1992, as hopes of economic recovery emerged, the sector weakened relative to the market. As the summer fears of a continuing recession set in, the sector started to gain once more. When devaluation made eventual recovery more certain, the relative slide resumed, to gather pace in recent weeks. Wellcome's performance shows what happens when you add specific company problems to those general concerns. On Thursday of last week, the outlook suddenly worsened for sales of Wellcome's most glamorous drug, its anti-Aids preparation Retrovir. Preliminary data from a Franco-British study indicated that, for patients who had not yet developed full Aids, Retrovir had little to offer. The share price fell immediately; since the study appeared, it has dropped 8 per cent. Drug companies frequently encounter setbacks to important drugs, and the market usually over-reacts. After a few days, investors remember that the company has other eggs in its basket, and the share price recovers. Earlier this week, it looked as if just that process was under way. On Monday, for example, when the stock market as a whole was down sharply in the aftermath of Friday's slide in New York, Wellcome managed a healthy recovery. The worst seemed over. On Wednesday, however, the pattern of recovery was jolted. Wellcome met analysts to put its case over Retrovir, but the audience was not convinced. The share price resumed its slide: it dropped another 23p, closing at 698p. On Thursday, it recovered to 703p, a net rise of 8p since the previous Friday. The Retrovir issue aside, Wellcome and others in the industry have some bumpy weeks ahead: Hillary Clinton's health-care plan is due by early May. The stock has some protection, however, in its relatively unglamorous rating: at 19 or so, the price/earnings ratio is the lowest it has been since the company was floated in 1986, leaving Wellcome trailing behind such stocks as BICC, Thorn EMI, or ICI. And, though the yield at 2.3 does not sound particularly generous, it is the highest since the stock was first available to the public. Such valuation calculations are also applied to the market as a whole. Econometric research just published by Goldman Sachs explores the extent to which they are a useful indicator of whether shares are cheap or dear. Looking at the UK market as a whole, the Goldman analysts conclude that the best indicator is the yield ratio (the ratio of the yield on long-term government bonds to the dividend yield on equities). This will not come as a surprise to the equity market, since the yield ratio is probably its most common rule of thumb. More interesting, perhaps, is Goldman's creation of a Composite Valuation Indicator, which bundles together all the measures commonly used to assess the market's value, assigning each the importance justified by how successful it is in 'explaining' stock market movements. This indicator works, the Goldman analysts say: trading on the basis of the indicator over the last 20 years would have doubled your money compared with a simple buy-and-hold strategy. At the moment, the indicator suggests the UK stock market is undervalued by around 10 per cent. No one seemed to be paying much attention to that sort of calculation this week: the FT-SE 100 index closed on Thursday at 2821.8, a drop of 48.1 points since Friday and a decline of 4 1/2 per cent since its peak earlier in the year. Investors were partly marking time before the holiday, partly peering edgily ahead to find the good news already implicit in share prices. As the Wellcome tale shows, that sort of market is easily spooked.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / The Long View: Selling the truth 
text:  TRUTH attracts a good press but, often, it fails to get an enthusiastic reception out there in the market-place. It is human nature to like to be told a story, even a little white lie. This is a roundabout way of getting into the debate over the accountants who are creating a stir by improving the quality of financial reporting. Their proposed new accounting standard, FRS3, has caused certain (but by no means all) company finance directors, City investment analysts and even financial editors to agonise over the loss of their simple, and supposedly reliable, earnings-per-share numbers. The Accounting Standards Board also is attacking the lax approaches to off-balance sheet reporting (now you see the debts, now you don't) and takeover accounting which created a rich field for 1980s' financial manipulators. But it has still to prove that truth will be popular. The accountants, in their role as company auditors, supposedly developed an answer to the problem of financial reporting years ago. It was called the 'true and fair view,' Fortunately for the commercial prosperity of the accountancy profession, the view did not live up to its name. To achieve high fees, providers of corporate services such as lawyers and accountants must be efficient at facilitating the ambitions of their clients. They are rewarded for telling their clients how to do something, not that a particular deal or profit target is impossible. But when, in the end, a string of apparently healthy companies such as Coloroll and Parkfield Group suddenly disappeared in puffs of smoke, the position of the auditing profession became impossible. The clean-up began. If you detect a whiff of cynicism, I plead extenuating circumstances on the ground that I endured a 10-year debate on inflation accounting, starting in the 1970s. Quite early on, the profession produced a perfectly decent, if rough-and-ready, inflation accounting standard that would have served investors' interests perfectly well. But government and industry opposed it, and later proposals became more complex without becoming more popular. Simply, most listed companies did not want to publish inflation-adjusted profit figures that were lower than the conventional historical cost version. To some extent, the stock market realised there was a problem, which is why the average price-earnings ratio was about 7 or 8 late in the 1970s compared with near 20 in today's conditions of low inflation; the difference reflects largely the poor quality of 1970s' earnings. But many companies appeared to take a wholly exploitative approach. Thus, British Gas published current cost/profit figures (nice low numbers) while it was a public corporation seeking to avoid price curbs, but majored on substantially higher historical cost numbers as soon as privatisation loomed and it wanted to maximise its share price. The same cosmetic approach was applied to takeovers. When one company acquires another, often there are heavy extra costs. If there are measures to rationalise the operations of the two companies, disruption will follow and the benefits, if any, usually will not be achieved for several years. So, you would think the obstacles to takeovers would be formidable, and that takeovers would be rare. The problems were solved by accountants, though. Costs disappeared, provisions were written back and profits rose smoothly - to the extent that it was argued sometimes during the takeover boom that such and such a company needed another acquisition soon if it was to maintain its profits growth. Years later, however, many acquisitive companies like Burton and Storehouse ran into big trouble. The truth will come out one day, but who is in a hurry? Investors prefer companies that deliver steady growth in earnings and dividends, and companies that fit such a description go to a premium. In the real world, profits move erratically up and down in a way which accentuates the risks. So, accountants and lawyers have been brought into play to create techniques and structures to generate the required image. Risk-averse institutional investors, reluctant to commit money to highly cyclical makers of building materials or engineering components, tend to prefer the likes of Hanson or BTR (or, perhaps these days, some of their less geriatric emulators). Do such rambling conglomerates become so large because they provide brilliant industrial management, or because they re-package industry into a form assimilable by the stock market? Part of the problem is one of corporate governance: that auditors are too much under the thumb of managements, and have only a minimal relationship with the shareholders to whom they are supposed to be responsible. A strong and independent audit committee might help, but such committees rarely are strong and independent in the companies where they really need to be. More fundamentally, my experiences in the inflation accounting debate led me to conclude that shareholders did not really want to know the truth. During the 1980s, the complacency seemed almost to develop into a kind of conspiracy of optimism. Who wanted to expose the realities of Polly Peck? Managers and shareholders and stockbrokers all wanted a high share price. A successful and growing company would generate high fees for the City of London. The important thing was not to be left stranded when the game ended. Now, we have to watch the investors and analysts as the anti-cosmetic Accounting Standards Board scrapes the make-up from company accounts. What remains might not always be a pretty sight: bumpy where you thought it was smooth and hard to recognise and understand. Perhaps the rouge and the mascara are being rejected forever. But human nature does not change, and the search will be on for a different kind of face-lift.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Science: saviour or tool of the Devil?: AC Grayling argues that it offers hope eventually of defeating oppressive religious superstitions 
text:  NOVELIST Susan Howatch has offered Pounds 1m to help resolve that great argument of the 20th century: are the advances of science destroying religion? Her gift, to the faculty of divinity at Cambridge university, has been made at a time when science is under fierce attack. The most recent assault is not from organised religion but from those who claim the wider message of science is destructive, presumptuous, or wrong. Despite increasing popular sympathy for this view, Howatch believes science and religion can co-exist peaceably and cites John Polkinghorne, a Cambridge physicist turned cleric, as an example of how this can be achieved, even in the same person. But she faces a battle to persuade sceptics. Richard Dawkins, an Oxford biologist, says: 'What has theology ever said that is of the smallest use to anybody? When has theology ever said anything that is demonstrably true and is not obvious?' Dawkins, who wrote The Blind Watchmaker, a best-seller which champions Charles Darwin's theory of the evolution, seems to suggest that religion is under siege from science. But, in the present debate, the issue seems to be the other way around. Big sales have been achieved by anti-science books, notably Bryan Appleyard's Understanding The Present, which leapt to second place in the best-seller lists in its first week of publication. A more fundamental attack on the basis of scientific method was launched last year by historian John Ralston Saul. In his book, Voltaire's Bastards, he says science has 'turned on man,' poisoning his environment and food and threatening his extinction. Scientists themselves are worried that public hostility to their work is contributing to the chronic shortage of funds for research. In a speech at the Royal Institution in February, Professor Dennis Noble, a distinguished Oxford medical scientist, suggested that British science might be under-funded because it is viewed as 'the ultimate pact with the Devil.' Noble thinks many people regard science as the source of society's ills, not just because of pollution and disasters such as Chernobyl but through 'the perception that science is deeply and irretrievably dehumanising.' Science has always had its critics, but the present attack is remarkable because it comes at the end of a century of scientific achievement which has transformed the human condition - mostly for the good. In the 17th century, science's chief opponent was the Inquisition. Deny that the earth moves, priests told astronomers, or be burnt at the stake. In the 19th century, the anti-science attack was directed at evolutionary theory: in the course of a public lecture, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce tried to rubbish Darwin's theory by asking whether the great scientist was descended from monkeys on his mother's or his father's side. Half the population of the United States in 1993 still shares Wilberforce's creationist view. Today, science's opponents form a coalition which complains that science is destructive, soul-less, and antipathetic to religion. Such people desire personal significance, a safe place in the universe, a sense of ultimate value. All this, they claim, is threatened by science. John Brooke, a senior lecturer in the history of science at Lancaster university, says in Science and Religion (1991): 'Science has generated its own penumbra of ignorance . . . (and) ethical problems that it is powerless to solve.' In reply, scientists point to the enormous benefits of research which, often, are taken for granted: electric light, antibiotics, air transport, telecommunications, central heating and the computer. Indeed, some believe that the achievements of science can be compared with the artistic and humanistic revolution of the Renaissance. Some critics emphasise the destructive effects of science, particularly in war, and its threat to the environment. Others, such as Louise Anthony in A Mind of One's Own (1993), see science as an instrument of oppression in advanced societies. Anthony, professor of philosophy at North Carolina State university, writes: 'Institutionalised science serves, in fact, to sustain and even enhance existing structures of inequality and domination.' But scientists can reply that these are abuses of scientific discoveries and not the fault of those who seek knowledge. Some critics are alarmed by science's picture of the universe as a neutral, contingent realm, purely material in composition and subject to dispassionate laws. They would prefer the universe to have a purpose, to be the outcome of design, and to be governed by benevolent forces. Others are worried by the thought that our cherished view of ourselves as creative, ethical beings, sensitive to beauty and capable of love, will be explained by science in terms merely of chemical processes. These supposed threats have led to violent responses. In his attack, Appleyard claims the 'bitter message' of science is that the universe offers no consolations; it does not exist for a reason, it just exists brutally 'like some thick-witted skinhead - mute, gormless and callous.' Science has emptied the universe of 'goodness, purpose and meaning' and threatens a 'terrible inversion' of human values. It is frightening, spiritually corrosive and belittling. Science's worst crime, says Appleyard, is that it ventures no answer to the question: Why is there a universe at all? It seems to me that the chief reason behind hostility to science is exactly what Howatch wishes were otherwise: its threat to religion. Some argue there is no such threat and point to the many distinguished scientists who have been religious: Newton, Michael Faraday and Howatch's own present-day example, Polkinghorne, who prefers a dog collar to a chair of physics. But the fact is that if the propositions of science and those of religion are taken on an equal footing, as each offering the factual truth about the universe, they are squarely inconsistent. The central, methodological principle of science is that every step in enquiry and experiment has to be public, repeatable, checkable and challengeable. It is this that gives authority to scientific theories. Critics offer alternative authorities for our beliefs: ancient writings, intuition, mystical insight, ethnic traditions, eco-biology, the teachings of sages or the example of heroes. What gives support to the claim that these are genuine sources of knowledge is the new intellectual fashion called post-modernism. This says there is no single set of truths about the world but as many different ways of seeing it as there are cultures or even individuals. There is no legitimate way of judging between viewpoints, post-modernists argue; it is merely intellectual imperialism to claim that, for example, western medicine is better than traditional African witch-doctoring. This view is known as relativism. Thus, Susan Hekman, professor of political science at the University of Texas, Arlington, writes in Gender and Knowledge (1990): 'Post-modernism undermines the rationality of science by allowing us to see that science is rooted in specific historical assumptions and, therefore, is not universal or absolute.' Such critics reveal ignorance of what science really is. It is true that some admirers believe it will provide the answer to everything one day; but this view, known as scientism, is a hopeless caricature of the true nature of science - which is much more sceptical, tentative, and limited in its objectives than either its extreme admirers or extreme critics realise. When people talk of 'science,' they forget there are many sciences. Particle physics and cosmology (the study of the origins and nature of the universe) are the two most-quoted fields of enquiry, not least because great efforts are now being made to bring together the two theories (quantum and relativity) which are central to each and which, so far, appear inconsistent. But other sciences give rise to much less controversy. Many - like medical science - are of such immediate and obvious benefit that it is hard to see how critics can maintain their general hostility. Science proceeds by subjecting hypotheses to rigorous examination, wherever possible experimentally. Failure to prove a theory false does not mean the theory is true - only that it can be used until something better turns up. So, all science is defensible and open-ended; further evidence can refute or change it. Science lives by enquiry, of which the essence is scepticism and open-mindedness. Each branch is concerned with a defined range of phenomena. No-one supposes that the important questions of aesthetics and politics could be resolved in a test tube. Yet critics believe, vaguely, that this is what scientists aspire to - which shows they do not understand what they criticise. The open-mindedness of science, and its need to thrive on challenge and debate, contrasts sharply with religion. Religions are governed by dogma and tradition, in defence of which - incredibly - some people are prepared to kill and die. Religions have been among the most destructive of historical phenomena; examples of oppressive and violent persecution abound. Despite the personal solace religion offers (a psychological function performed by other things also, such as art and love), and the artistic inspiration it has prompted (although such inspiration comes from other sources besides), on the organised scale it can be dangerous and cruel. Science is progressive and cumulative; religion is static and backward-looking. Mankind's hope might lie in this fact, for it suggests that open-minded curiosity might eventually defeat oppressive superstitions. Voltaire once remarked that he loved the man who sought truth, but hated the man who claimed to have found it. One was a scientist, the other a priest. Perhaps Howatch's Pounds 1m will help us to re-discover Voltaire's insight. It might not be what she hoped for, but it would finally end the conflict between science and religion. AC Grayling is a lecturer in philosophy at Birkbeck College, London, and senior research fellow at St Anne's College, Oxford .

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Easter rain brings spring cheer for estate agents 
text:  AS BRITAIN'S housing market shows strong signs of a recovery, estate agents are hoping the Easter weekend - traditionally the beginning of the busiest period of the year for house sales - will be their most profitable for years. Sales over the next few weeks will determine whether the revival will last or peter out as in previous springs. Estate agents' offices and show houses are likely to be open throughout the holiday weekend. Though the heaviest business normally begins on Easter Saturday, the signs yesterday in the area hardest hit - the south east - were good. Pocock &amp; Shaw, a Cambridge estate agency, said: 'We had expected Good Friday to be rather quiet; instead we have been frantically busy. 'The wet weather may have helped us in that people, instead of going for a day out, have been coming in to ask about properties. We have seen between 50 and 60 people.' Mr Henry Rowe, an estate agent in Saffron Walden, Essex, said the holiday had got off to an encouraging start. Mr Kevin Moll, Mr Rowe's partner, said: 'We have sold 70 homes since the beginning of this year, about a quarter more than during the first three months of last year. We are currently averaging about 20 sales a month. In two days last weekend we had 15 offers to buy. 'There have been periods over the past four years when sales have been at this level but we have not had such a sustained recovery as we have seen this year.' Mr Jonathan Harvey, director of Friend &amp; Falcke, which sells in London's Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, said: 'Sales are up about 60 per cent on the first three months of last year. 'A lot of these are to foreign buyers taking advantage of sterling's devaluation. Purchases by Britons, however, are still up by 15 per cent to 20 per cent on the same period last year.' Their experience has been shared by estate agents, housebuilders and building societies in other parts of the country. Sales figures for 15 of the country's largest national housebuilders show offers to buy new homes have risen by approaching a third during the first 13 weeks of this year. This includes sales to housing associations. Sales to private sector buyers are estimated by builders to have risen by between a fifth and a quarter. The weekly figures, compiled by the Housebuilders Federation, measure net reservations - sales on which a deposit has been paid less cancellations. Net reservations for the 15 housebuilders, representing about 20 per cent of the new housing market, totalled 5,000 in January and February, compared with 4,200 in the first two months of last year. This trend continued in March in spite of a slight slowdown in the week before the Budget. Mr David Holland, chief executive of Wimpey Homes, the country's second largest housebuilder, said: 'We have had an excellent start to the year which we now hope to build upon. Prices have stopped falling. The next stage will be to start withdrawing sales incentives such as discounts, cheap mortgages and removal expenses. This is starting to happen in a few areas. 'Provided the recent revival is sustained we might even see prices starting to rise again by the end of this year.'

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Japan may halt Cambodia operations over UN deaths 
text:  THE KILLING of a Japanese volunteer working for the United Nations in Cambodia has brought a warning that Japan could withdraw from the country if attacks on UN personnel increase. Mr Toshio Nakayama, Japan's defence minister, said yesterday that 'if it becomes clear that a widespread armed disruption of the (UN-organised Cambodian) elections is in force, we must of course think of an emergency evacuation or a halt in operations'. About 600 Japanese military personnel are in Cambodia as part of the UN operation. Although the victim, Mr Atsuhito Nakata, 25, was a civilian, his death has prompted concern that Japanese forces could become entangled in an intensifying conflict. Nevertheless, Japan yesterday continued with its planned Cambodian involvement by despatching 250 army engineers to join an advance team of 350 in Bangkok. This force is due to relieve the 600 troops sent six months ago. Mr Nakata was the sixth worker to be killed in nine direct attacks on UN personnel in the past two weeks. His UN-marked car was stopped on Thursday by a group of armed men. His Cambodian interpreter, Mr Lay Sokphip, was also killed. The Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, which is boycotting the UN's peace process, has been blamed for some of the attacks and is suspected of most of the rest. The group denies responsibility. Japan's Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, yesterday called for the immediate return of the 600 already in Cambodia, mostly transportation personnel, on the grounds that the Cambodian conflict does not fit the guidelines set for Japanese participation in a peacekeeping operation. Under those guidelines, Japanese personnel should not be despatched if a ceasefire agreement has collapsed. The SDP argues that the spate of killings shows the ceasefire is no longer effective. But a sudden pull-out of troops would damage the image of the Japanese government, which sees the participation as evidence that the country is playing a more active role in international affairs. A retreat would also hurt Tokyo's campaign for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Blood stains the peace, Page 4

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / French rates predicted to fall 'significantly': Finance minister sees confidence being restored 
text:  THE FRENCH government predicted yesterday that interest rates, which have fallen on the money markets by up to 1.5 percentage points since the conservatives won a sweeping election victory nearly two weeks ago, 'will decrease significantly from now until the summer'. Though Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, said there was no question of pushing rates lower, he forecast that they would 'fall by themselves' because of a restoration of confidence in the French economy and currency. Markets are speculating that the Bank of France will cut its upper official rate - the five-day repurchase rate, currently at 12 per cent - next week. Reaction to the new conservative government's programme, which Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, announced to parliament on Thursday, was largely favourable. Stock market operators, however, expressed some dismay at planned increases in indirect taxes to reduce a budget deficit which Mr Balladur estimated would grow to FFr330bn (Pounds 39.9bn) this year or 3.4 per cent of national output. The only discordant notes came from Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party's new temporary leader, who said Mr Balladur had shown 'an amazing lack of imagination', while the Communists' parliamentary group expressed its 'firm opposition' to the Balladur plan. Nonetheless, Mr Balladur won his first vote of confidence by 457 to 81 votes, with two abstentions. Mr Balladur said that combatting unemployment, currently at 10.6 per cent of the workforce, was his 'absolute priority', but he saw no hope of stabilising job losses until the end of this year. He asked employers to lay off workers only as a last resort. Mr Francois Perigot, head of the Patronat employers' federation, yesterday agreed that his members should remember that 'making someone redundant was a serious matter'. Mr Alphandery said draft legislation to give the Bank of France independence and to privatise state-held companies would be ready before the end of next week. He expected Parliament to approve both laws by the summer. The French central bank has so far not chosen to reflect the easing of money market rates in its official rates, in order to attract money into francs. This has replenished its foreign exchange reserves, drained during the fight to keep the franc tied to the D-Mark in recent months. Mr Alphandery said the bank would repay loans from the Bundesbank several weeks before they were due. After the overnight money rate dropped to 10 1/8 per cent, and the rate for one-month money fell to 9 5/8 per cent, on Thursday, many analysts saw little sense in the Bank of France keeping its 'repo' rate at 12 per cent, and predicted a possible cut on Tuesday. The central bank is considered likely to maintain its intervention rate, at which it lends limited amounts to banks, at 9.1 per cent.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / Change of heart by two banks blocked 3i flotation 
text:  A CHANGE of heart by Barclays and National Westminster banks led to Thursday's abandonment of an autumn share flotation by Investors in Industry (3i), the venture capital group, it was understood yesterday. Both banks, which together own 41 per cent of 3i, are thought to believe that 3i's value is likely to increase sharply over the next two years, so any flotation should be postponed for at least that long. The abandonment of the flotation plan led to the resignation of 3i's chairman, Mr Alan Wheatley, who joined the group last July on the understanding that it would obtain a stock market listing. He will be succeeded by Sir Max Williams, deputy chairman, until the appointment of a permanent replacement. The Bank of England is understood to be particularly disappointed that the share sale has been shelved. 3i, which has net assets of Pounds 1.2bn and is the leading provider of risk capital to small and medium-sized com-panies, is owned by six of the UK's biggest banks and the Bank of England. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, which owns 13 per cent, said there was no 'big split' between the banks on whether to sell. 'You would not have got much of a price for the shares at the moment. Even for those willing to consider selling, it depends on price,' he said. Barings, 3i's merchant bank, had argued that the sale was in the banks' interest. A month ago, Barings recommended to the banks that an autumn flotation should go ahead, according to bankers and a 3i director. The proposal was that the banks should sell a minority stake, leaving them with between 60 and 75 per cent of the company. Even though the depth of the UK recession meant the stock market price of 3i's shares would be less than some banks wanted, Barings believed that the long-term value of their remaining shares would be increased by the flotation for two reasons: As a quoted company, 3i would for the first time have been able to take advantage of its investment trust status. This would have meant that, as the economy recovered, 3i would have been able to sell an increasing number of investments but without paying capital gains tax. 3i would have raised additional capital in the flotation, allowing it to take advantage of investment opportunities as economic growth returned.

text:  Yet again 3i's shareholders have delayed the company's slide down the slipway. Their indecision is puzzling. It has also sparked the abrupt departure of 3i's recently-installed chairman who had been entrusted with completing the flotation. There is certainly no pressing need for shareholders to sell. Midland's once-desperate need for capital has been reduced following its takeover by HSBC. Other bank shareholders too have seen their financial pressures lessen. They believe they can realise greater value by waiting for the upswing. Since its disappointing interim results, 3i has reported that its investments have risen strongly. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of new investment applications. But the stock market has already anticipated much of the recovery. In recent months there has been a marked narrowing of the gap between asset values and share prices in the quoted investment trust sector. 3i's size and reputation could have perhaps ensured a flotation price just 10 per cent below its asset value. Given that 3i was only going to be partially floated, it is difficult to believe it could much improve on that. The suspicion must be that the delay does not simply signify a change in market tactics but also a reassessment of strategy. The banks should clarify their intentions. Otherwise they will damage the company now and make it harder to float later.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK water 
text:  The thirst for a secure yield is working to the advantage of water companies. The sector is close to the high point relative to the market reached last August. Sterling was then shackled to the ERM and the outlook elsewhere was grim. Given the brighter industrial picture, the relative attractions of water might be expected to diminish. But that allows neither for the dwindling returns on cash, nor for dividend cuts by other high-yield stocks. The chancellor has meanwhile helped the cause by reducing the tax credit on dividends paid to gross funds. Water companies are unlikely to compensate gross funds for lost income. With dividends covered around three times by earnings, most could afford to do so. But such action would have to be explained to the regulator. The companies might also prefer to conserve cover in case of tougher times following next year's regulatory review. Yield support may thus imply a cap on prices. The yield premium of the sector to the rest of the market is already below 20 per cent. Things could get turbulent as the shares start to trade ex-dividend. Capital expenditure plans for the second half of the decade have not been finalised, let alone the rate of return on capital the regulator will allow. With the medium-term prospects so uncertain, the market is naturally inclined to concentrate on the immediate attraction of yield. That looks short-sighted, when there is now only a year to go before hard bargaining begins with the regulator.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Sun Alliance 
text:  Another thumping loss from Sun Alliance shows just how unbalanced the UK's biggest insurer became during the 1980s. Its general insurance business was weighted too heavily towards the UK and exposure to mortgage indemnity was excessive. Yet the life assurance side is not big enough to offset the impact of recession. On the investments side, faith in equities and property paid off handsomely during years of asset price inflation. Thursday's property write-down is the penalty. The net asset value is now little more than half the Pounds 3bn peak reached in 1989. Balance is belatedly being restored. By surrendering market share on UK household insurance, Sun Alliance is reducing its exposure to freak storms and floods. The acquisition of Denmark's Hafnia last month raises the proportion of European premium income to 23 per cent - and adds weight to the life business. Disposing of the big stakes in Commercial Union and Chubb last year reduced exposure to equities in general and other insurers in particular. But there is no escaping the legacy of mortgage indemnity. The damage this year should be below the Pounds 180m underwriting loss sustained in 1992. But the rate of repossessions and the average cost per claim will only gradually decline. The main comfort is that the balance sheet looks strong enough to stand the strain. Even so, a solvency ratio of 50 per cent after the acquisition of Hafnia would have been 7 points lower were it not for sterling's devaluation. The position is not as robust as Sun Alliance would have the market believe.

text:  Norwich Union has not chosen a propitious time to announce a shift of its investment strategy back towards equities. Though the FT-SE just held above the 2,800 level on Wednesday, it still shed 48 points on the week. The strongly negative reaction of companies like Wellcome, Fisons and BAT to specific bad news suggests that individual valuations are stretched. All things are relative, however, and Norwich Union's decision may say as much about its fears for the gilts as about its hopes for the equity market. Certainly the news that house prices are rising puts a faint whiff of inflation back in the air. That will not help the long end of the gilt market, especially in view of the government's heavy funding programme. It may make the government even more reluctant to cut interest rates again, despite the rise in sterling. That would leave the equity market without justification for a further assault on the 3,000 level. While recovery does seem to be taking hold, it is not strong enough to make much difference to expectations for corporate earnings. For now the equity market still seems interest-rate driven. Paradoxically, it may therefore react better to bad economic news than to good. Sterling's trade-weighted index is already back up to 80, where it stood when interest rates were cut in January. The currency will become stronger still if the government stays reluctant to cut rates once the Bundesbank really starts to relax. That would hit equities on another front: the export-related earnings growth factored in after the devaluation would disappear into thin air.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Good inflation news leaves Dow flat 
text:  Wall Street Good news on inflation and a big rally in bond prices failed to lift US stock markets on Thursday, and the main indices all ended the shortened week flat or lower, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.54 at 3,396.48. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.89 lower at 441.84, while the Amex composite finished down 1.43 at 416.24, and the Nasdaq composite 2.55 weaker at 666.33. NYSE trading volume was 282m shares. Equities perked up briefly at the opening in reaction to the news that the March producer price index rose 0.4 per cent. Although the increase was above some forecasts, the bulk of the increase was attributable to higher energy prices. If the volatile food and energy components were excluded from the PPI, the 'core' rate of producer price inflation rose by only 0.1 per cent. After two months of higher-than-expected core PPI readings, the weak March figure was a welcome sight for the inflation-sensitive bond market, where prices surged, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury issue down to 6.85 per cent. Ultimately, however, the good inflation news and the big drop in yields failed to sustain equity prices, which quickly fell back from their early highs. News of poor corporate earnings, coupled with some futures-related sell programs, ensured that stocks remained in negative territory all day. The big corporate story of the day was US Surgical, which plunged Dollars 15 1/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 in volume of 7m shares after the company warned that it expects second and third quarter sales, and second quarter profits, to be significantly lower than a year ago. Aluminium Company of America dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 60 3/8 in volume of 1.5m shares as investors reacted badly to Wednesday's late announcement that first quarter net income fell to 31 cents a share, down from 64 cents a share a year earlier. After the news the brokerage house, Smith Barney, reduced its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'. Philip Morris, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 46 1/8 in volume of 7m shares, remained under selling pressure in the wake of last week's announcement that it was slashing the price of its Marlboro cigarettes in an attempt to salvage market share. Westinghouse Electric climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 in busy trading after the company announced it will sell, for Dollars 1bn, most of the commercial property assets of its financial services unit to an partnership run by investment bank Lehman Brothers. Canada TORONTO was depressed by losses in gold and metal shares after PainWebber downgraded its recommendation for Alcan Aluminium. The TSE-300 composite index eased 9.62 to 3,591.80, and turnover retreated from CDollars 514.6m to CDollars 430m.

text:  AFTER another new high on Thursday, index-linked selling by investment trusts and profit-taking by individuals left the Nikkei index moderately lower yesterday, after a brief rise over the 20,000 level on technical trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei, up 134.04 on Thursday to 19,967.27, shed 75.09 to 19,892.18, 2.3 per cent higher on the week, after a day's high of 20,126.09 and a low of 19,728.34 after Thursday's 20,041.16 and 19,721.01 respectively. Volume rose from 664m shares to 750m on options-related trading. Advances led declines by 568 to 490 with 125 unchanged. On Thursday, gainers outnumbered losers by 600 to 473 with 125 unchanged. The Topix index, which rose 9.48 to 1,568.70 on Thursday, fell 5.42 to 1,563.28. While activity by foreigners was subdued due to the Easter holidays, life insurers and public pension funds were seen purchasing stocks. Mr Chris Newton said: 'Sentiment among investors has improved enormously, but the market may face weakness after the government unveils its fiscal package next week.' Small stocks improved yesterday. The second section rose 1.8 per cent, while the over-the-counter market registered a 6 per cent gain. Profit-taking eroded securities companies. Nomura Securities lost Y40 to Y2,170 and Daiwa Securities fell Y10 to Y1,290. Banks were also lower with Industrial Bank of Japan retreating Y40 to Y2,650 and Fuji Bank losing Y10 to Y2,060. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y20,000 to Y1,03m. High-technology issues were also lower on profit taking. However, Fujitsu, the most active issue of the day, rose Y19 to Y706 on speculation that the company will benefit from instalments of personal computers at public schools. In Osaka, the OSE average, which Thursday improved 30.02 to 21,577.43, fell 1.03 to 21,576.40. Volume remained almost unchanged at 30m shares against 30.6m. Roundup TAIWAN, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were open yesterday after a mixed day for the region on Thursday. TAIWAN closed lower as turnover shrank, the weighted index ending 78.02, or 1.6 per cent down at 4,847.13, 2.1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover down from TDollars 56.6bn to TDollars 49.4bn. After a 12-month peak on Wednesday, Thursday's 1.8 per cent fall had hurt sentiment. In addition, there was concern that money market liquidity was tightening, and that the supply of margin loans could shrink. SEOUL firmed again after a setback on Thursday, the composite stock index closing 7.86 higher at 702.93 to end the week with a 3.2 per cent gain on the prospect of economic recovery. Turnover soared from Won589.9bn to Won921.1bn. KUALA LUMPUR ended mixed with the KLSE composite index down 1.99 at 655.24,, 0.6 per cent higher in the week, on renewed speculative buying of second and third-line stocks. Idris Hydraulic again led activity with 92.4 million shares traded. It closed up 13 cents at MDollars 2.85. BANGKOK saved its spurt until the last moment, as institutional buying of major bank shares in the closing minutes of trade pushed the SET index up 4.22 to 862.71, up 0.6 per cent on the week. On Thursday, AUSTRALIAN stocks rebounded at the close, with investors encouraged by lower-than-expected jobless figures. The All Ordinaries index added 10.8 to 1,665.7, 1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of ADollars 221.1m. Fairfax was the star performer, rising 4 cents to a ADollars 2.02 high after Publishing and Broadcasting, a private subsidiary of Mr Kerry Packer, said that it owned 10.45 per cent of the voting shares. BOMBAY, where the BSE index rose 97.24 on Wednesday in anticipation of an interest rate cut, lost it all when the cut did not take place. The index fell 97.77 to 2,310.91, virtually flat on the week.

text:  MILAN, open along with Brussels and Istanbul yesterday, managed once again to set Italy's political scandals aside, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN's Comit index rose another 2.08 to 512.09, a rise of 7.7 per cent on the week. Brokers said that turnover was surprisingly high, boosted by Thursday's government restatement of its determination to move on privatisation, and by final cabinet approval of the law on private pensions. Among banks, one privatisation candidate, BCI, closed some L93 higher at L4,695, but Credito Italiano slipped L35 to L2,710 as treasury statements on Thursday were perceived as indicating that there will not be a public offer of the shares. BRUSSELS closed the shortened, pre-holiday session with the Bel-20 index 4.65 lower at 1,260.47. Business was concentrated mainly in blue chip stocks but the big holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique, barely reacted to late Thursday's announcement of a 38 per cent rise in 1992 earnings, closing BFr10 higher at BFr2,325. ISTANBUL's market index swung between an early high of 6,914 and a low of 6,645 before bouncing up on late support to end 16.66 higher at a new all-time high close of 6,754.11, 7.1 per cent higher on the week. On Thursday, PARIS saw early gains obliterated by the absence of any easing from the Bank of France, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's remark that he was considering raising indirect taxes to balance the social security system's accounts. The CAC-40 index finished just 2.90 higher at 1,986.86, 0.2 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was healthier at FFr3.23bn. Michelin rose FFr3.70 to FFr168.80 on short covering, more than recovering Wednesday's losses on a profits warning. However, L'Oreal, France's largest cosmetics company, looked on safer ground with a FFr33 gain at FFr1,146 after Wednesday's late news of a 16 per cent gain in profits. FRANKFURT recovered, the DAX index closing 5.42 higher at 1,655.73, 0.3 per cent down on the week, in turnover down from DM5.6bn to DM4.6bn. BMW rose DM7.50 to DM484.50, and Volkswagen by DM3 to DM311, as Daimler recovered only DM1.20 to DM565 for a DM45.50, or 7.5 per cent drop on the week. Mr Cord Suerie at Paribas Capital Markets said, however, that Paribas maintained its buy rating on Daimler, remaining quite optimistic for the group following its US listing. Lufthansa rose DM4.30 to DM112, picking up on the excitement among airline stocks elsewhere in Europe. ZURICH edged higher, the 3.4 gain to 2,188.3 in the SMI index leaving it little changed on the week. Swissair bearers rose SFr35, or 5.8 per cent to SFr630 after the airline claimed at Wednesday's annual press conference to be taking the initiative in talks about an alliance with KLM, SAS and Austrian Airlines. Analysts believe that any such link would provide substantial potential for further cost cutting, and that it would open up a much larger market for the Swiss group. AMSTERDAM saw foreign demand as the CBS Tendency index edged 0.4 higher to 107.9, 1 per cent up on the week. Heineken, an outperformer being reassessed by investors, shed Fl 2.40 to Fl 188.50 after Wednesday's flat 1992 earnings and profits warning. Unilever lost another Fl 1.60 to Fl 204.80 in response to lower earnings estimates from London brokers. KLM picked up Fl 1.30 to Fl 29.40 and Philips, finding renewed demand from US investors, added 70 cents to Fl 25.30. Bursumij Wehry, the trading company, rose Fl 3.80 or 4.6 per cent to a year's high of Fl 86 ahead of its annual report on Tuesday. The stock has risen by Fl 15, or 21 per cent since March 16 when the company reported higher 1992 net profits and forecast an improvement in 1993 earnings. DUBLIN extended Wednesday's gains, the ISEQ overall index closing up 16.68 on the day at 1,522.44, 1.8 per cent better on the week. Mr Robbie Kelleher of Davy Stockbrokers said that the continuing fall in money market rates had brought foreign buyers back into the market after some profit-taking and that moderately sized companies like Avonmore and Waterfood, in the food business, and Independent Newpapers had taken over from the biggest blue chips at the top of the performance charts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 8                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1151.15     1150.97     1151.32     1152.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1210.22     1210.93     1210.49     1211.47  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1151.68     1151.87     1152.56     1151.40 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1210.54     1211.29     1211.22     1211.28  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Apr 7     Apr 6     Apr 5     Apr 2     Apr 1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1144.36   1147.43   1136.15   1140.36   1144.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1206.25   1210.05   1202.24   1215.52   1219.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1153.46; 200 - 1213.25 Low/day: 100 - 1150.60  200 - 1209.54.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreigners climb aboard the Lima rollercoaster - Peru's fast growing market 
text:  Foreign investment is the driving force behind Lima's small, but lively bolsa. Since March 18, when Peru finally normalised relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, and became re-eligible for loans, both daily volume and the general shares index have registered sharp increases. And foreign buyers account for around two-thirds of all activity. The long-awaited IMF approval for Peru's economic programme boosted the index by 18 per cent in a week, while volumes traded rose to around USDollars 5.5m a day, an all-time record. However, the market's equity capitalisation had already jumped from USDollars 1.4bn at the end of 1991 to Dollars 2.6bn 12 months later. The Lima bolsa was the second most profitable in the world last year, according to International Finance Corporation figures - up 125 per cent in dollar terms and streets ahead of all other Latin American stock markets. Leading Peruvian brokers are predicting a similar performance this year. 'It's the confidence factor,' says Mr Jose Luque Otero, president of the Lima bolsa's board. 'The rules of the game are clear and foreign investors appreciate that.' Like all emerging markets, Lima has proved highly vulnerable to political ups and downs. Just when foreign investors were starting to bring money in early last year, attracted by a wave of reforming legislation which transformed Peru into one of the world's least-regulated markets, President Fujimori dissolved Congress and suspended the constitution. The stock market plunged into recession, the index declining steadily for six months. Then September's surprise capture of the Shining Path guerrilla chief and other high-ranking leaders dramatically reversed the trend. For the past seven months, with only a slight hiccup when the economy minister was changed, the index has soared. Now, a year after the 'Fujicoup', formal democracy has been restored and both the president and his radical economic reform programme appear more secure than ever. Mr Fujimori's personal popularity exceeds 60 per cent, the privatisation process is being accelerated and direct foreign investment, particularly from Asia and Latin America, is getting under way. Two specific factors are expected to bolster the bolsa this year and next. First, the government's privatisation office has announced sales totalling between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars 1.4bn before year's end. In some, the stock exchange will play an important role, as it did in the sell-off of six smallish state companies last year. The other element which will stimulate bolsa activity this year is the start-up of new private pension funds, known as AFPs. Designed along the lines of the successful Chilean model, Peruvian AFPs will begin operating in June. In the short-term, AFPs are expected to capture around Dollars 500m a year. Of that, experts calculate that Dollars 120m will go into the stock market, immediately boosting daily volumes by around 15 per cent. Because of the size of the Lima bolsa, this could exert important upward pressure on prices. Currently, almost 300 companies are quoted, but regular trading is confined to about a dozen; there have been weeks when only two stocks have accounted for one-third of all trading. One headache for the investor picking a likely company is the unreliability of balance sheets. Until 1991, hyperinflation played havoc with figures and serious comparative studies are still impossible. 'You simply have to resort to strategies like counting how many bags of cement or crates of beer they're selling,' says one fund manager. Lima's blue chip shares include the two main breweries, Backus and Johnston and Compania Nacional de Cerveza (CNC); two cement companies; the large privately-owned Banco de Credito and the Lima telephone company, CPT. The state's holdings in CPT and the finance companies are due for sell-off later this year and trading has been heavy. In recent weeks, however, star performers have been mining shares. Minerals account for half of Peru's annual exports but the over-valued Sol has kept the sector badly depressed for the past two years. Now, with the prospect of a 10 per cent devaluation on 1993 after a similar rate last year, investors are looking seriously at mining shares again. The government is claiming that the country's prolonged recession has now bottomed out. GDP is set to rise between 3.5 and 5 per cent this year, with inflation likely to stay under 50 per cent, low by Peruvian standards.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Coats firmer 
text:  Textile group Coats Viyella firmed 4 to 241 1/2 p as at least two securities houses decided that the shares offered a buying opportunity. UBS was reiterating its buy stance on the stock and Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken published a buy recommendation. Mr Khaleeq Taimuri, Carr's textile specialist, argued that the group's premium rating was well justified in the light of its earnings potential, the recovery of the dollar and the containment of losses in Brazil. ICI hardened a penny to 1143p as the soon to be demerged company slapped a gag on a large area of the market ahead of its impending Pounds 1.3bn rights issue. The group needs to raise the money for the creation of a separate pharmaceuticals arm, Zeneca, and the rights issue is expected in June. However, the market has been somewhat surprised at the breadth of the gag, which extends to all its brokers whether they are core advisers or subsidiaries, and whether they are involved in the UK or overseas areas of the cash call. SG Warburg, BZW, Goldman Sachs and Hoare Govett are all being banned from comment. Concern that an area of Smith &amp; Nephew's US business would be hit affected the stock, which closed 4 1/2 lower at 151p. US Surgical, which provides equipment for keyhole surgery, had announced that it was shifting from direct supplier to distributor and there were fears that Smith &amp; Nephew would have to follow the same route. However, an analyst said Smith played a very small part in keyhole surgery and 'marking down the shares was wholly inappropriate'. Reuters Holdings recovered 7 to 1337p after the news and electronic information group announced a deal with its US subsidiary. The first day of dealing in Holliday Chemical Holdings went very well considering the desultory holiday atmosphere in the market. The new shares began trading at 195p and were bought up to 213p, with 12m traded. The utilities areas all suffered from profit-taking, with the water shares especially vulnerable. Anglian declined 6 to 546p, Thames 7 to 556p, Severn Trent 5 to 527p and North West 4 to 528p. SG Warburg appreciated 9 to 649p, still boosted by the prospect of substantial fee income for its participation in the BT III issue later this year. Mirror Group Newspapers approached their issue price, adding 4 at 121p, following a positive results statement earlier in the week. The shares received a further boost from a buy note from NatWest Securities. The house likes the aggressive stance taken by the new editor and management team. A positive statement from Carlton Communications ahead of a forthcoming conference broadcasters meeting helped the shares recover from an oversold position. Carlton is very confident about its Quantel digital manipulation system, which has been doing well, particularly in Japan. The stock ended 9 higher at 747p. BICC shares retreated sharply, closing 13 lower at 343p following heavy turnover of 3.2m after James Capel, the agency stockbroker, was reported as having downgraded the stock. Housebuilders responded to recent surveys hinting at an upturn in sales in recent weeks. George Wimpey rose 6 to 149p, Persimmon 6 to 244p and Wilson Connolly 3 to 166p.

headline:  FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sun Alliance down 
text:  A sharp reduction in losses at Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, to a level very much in line with most market forecasts, failed to stem a sustained bout of selling in the shares after analysts registered their surprise at the level of property write-downs that were announced by the group. The write-downs were partly responsible for a substantial fall in the company's solvency margin - net assets as a proportion of non-life premiums  -from 69 per cent to 54 per cent and a decline from 286p to 280p in the net asset value. The solvency margin is expected to fall a further 4 percentage points to 50 per cent after the group completes its purchase of Hafnia's Danish operations. One analyst said the drop in the solvency margin would 'impose a severe limitation on the group's dividend prospects'. Nevertheless, Mr Trevor May, a keen supporter of the shares, said he was keeping the stock on the 'buy' list and shifting his current year forecast from Pounds 115m to Pounds 128m. Mr Youssef Ziai, Morgan Stanley's insurance specialist, forecast that for the shares to make progress Sun needs an improvement in operating profits. Mr John Russell of Hoare Govett increased his 1993 profits estimate to Pounds 182m but warned that prospects for the dividend are very constrained. Sun shares settled 5 off at 349p on turnover of 4.3m.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: 'Cyrano' without a heart / David Bintley's new ballet for the Royal Ballet is historical flummery 
text:  WHATEVER ELSE David Bintley's new Cyrano may not be, it is consistent. Consistent in its determination to tickle a rib and jerk a tear, in its eager pursuit of the lowest common denominator in score, design and dance. It offers spectacle akin to Hollywood costume drama, with the quaintness and pish-tushery, the plumed hats and swordsmanship, dear to fans of the Three Musketeers. It has jokes, crowd scenes, thin choreography, and a constant buzz of small dramatic roles being played to the hilt. Its relationship with ballet as a serious art is tenuous. The first performance of Cyrano took place on Thursday night. It is in three acts and follows the narrative of Rostand's play; it deploys a large cast, and defies comprehension as anything other than a display of historical costume. It is best, first, to forget Rostand. His Cyrano is about the intoxication of words, the torrential images, the verbal conceits and caprices, with which his hero greets life and love, and provides a carapace for his deepest feelings. To convert this into movement presupposes a treatment less tightly wedded to Rostand's narrative than Bintley has chosen. His Cyrano the versifier and Cyrano the swordsman must mime speech or battle dutifully, while encased in the trappings of period dress and predictable steps. And without the magic of language, we are left with a melodrama whose picaresque elements may be intriguing to produce, but do not encourage Bintley in the creation of dance incident of any extended interest. What we see is historical flummery. Hayden Griffin has designed scenery and costumes that are accurate, careful, and claustrophobic - for part of the evening the stage looks too small for the action and the seething hordes in boots and hats and swirling cloaks. What we hear in Wilfred Joseph's score is eclectic writing that is like a patchwork of influences from pastiche Prokofiev to feeblest Erich Korngold. It is music as sound-track, and though it may be obedient to Bintley's dramatic scheme, it encourages no expansiveness of drama or feeling: the central moments of the narrative - the balcony scene; Cyrano's last meeting with Roxane - are cheated. But Cyrano de Bergerac as a drama has been cheated throughout. Bintley has opted for spectacle, for flashy effects - a brawl in the theatre; the siege of Arras - and has found no way to touch the heart of the play, which is Cyrano's heart. Amid the industrious to-ing and fro-ing of the cast - and all Rostand's characters are there, busily making their mark - the central tragedy of Cyrano, Roxane and Christian is diminished since, as I have suggested, the play's concern with words is not to be translated into dance. The justification for the enterprise is, nevertheless, Stephen Jefferies' incarnation of Cyrano. From his earliest appearances, nearly 20 years ago, Jefferies showed himself one of those rare beings who are entirely at home on stage, able to convey, with superlative precision and clarity, the most fleeting emotions. In his greatest roles - I think especially of his Rudolf in Mayerling - his performances were touched with genius. As Cyrano, he is a marvel. The part may be limited, but Jefferies' playing knows no horizons, no constraints. Passion, humour, sensibility, lightning shifts between sorrow and manic energy, are part of a reading as complete and compelling as any I have seen in the play. He even convinces us that Cyrano is a poet - which the ballet no-where does. In the speech when Cyrano pretends to have fallen from the moon (embellished with exquisite vulgarity by musical quotes from the Moonlight sonata, and other lunar tunes) Jefferies is a consummate droll. In those tightrope moments when Cyrano nearly - ah, so nearly - declares himself to Roxane, Jefferies is sublime in sensitivity and controlled feeling. It is a glorious performance. Among the other principals, Lesley Collier is an intelligent if rather mature Roxane; Bruce Sansom an agreeable Christian, though the role looks papery. The rest of the cast play and dance for all they are worth - and they are worth a ballet better than this.

text:  TODAY IS the centenary of one of the most momentous struggles of modern European history. The date you may have forgotten: the battle, surely not. May 4 1891 was, of course, the day when Professor Moriarty, the 'Napoleon of crime', grappled above the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland with the world's wisest detective, Sherlock Holmes. To mark the centenary, a party of 100 Sherlockologists has been journeying towards Meiringen and the Reichenbach Falls. The pilgrims are clad entirely in late-Victorian and Edwardian costume: en route to the Falls, they will have stopped at various Swiss stations, and been greeted by local mayors and brass bands. Negotiating Alpine paths in spats and knickerbockers must be more than compensated by celebrity in those immaculate Swiss railway stations; and it is right to call these people pilgrims, for they are bound for the site of a miracle. Holmes was declared dead; he returned to life, and as far as anyone knows, is agelessly pursuing apiculture somewhere on the Sussex Downs. It has been put about by one of the many learned members of the Sherlock Holmes Society that the death and three-year disappearance of the detective was really a severe nervous breakdown, brought on by the strain of tackling Moriarty and his henchmen. This hypothesis is typical of the Sherlockologists: like Holmes himself, they like to produce the occasional monograph. The Swiss excursion is the most ambitious of their activities; otherwise, they meet up for an annual dinner on January 6, to honour the sleuth's birthday, and stage jaunts to inspect the locations of his cases. Conan Doyle always left a few clues: a house embroidered with wisteria here, a suspicious thicket there - enough to get the Sherlockologists rifling through back numbers of The Times, and checking Met Office records, to quibble over exact dates and places. The Sherlock Holmes Society has a membership 1,000 strong. Its secretary would rather his name were not given here: he can hardly cope with the volume of correspondence he receives as it is. This doesn't surprise me. The Holmes stories are, as George Orwell memorably categorised them, Good Bad Books; I don't think there are any Better Bad Books, in fact. The formulaic writing nauseated even Conan Doyle himself, but in many respects it has worn more hardily than the style of Conan Doyle's disciple, PG Wodehouse. We still like to read with frissons of horror about crimes in Upper Norwood and althoughBaker Street is now infested with tarts in our imaginations it still contains a drug addict with the sharpest of wits, a scholar who can go five rounds of fisticuffs with the biggest bar bully - a hawkish physiognomy over a violin or Bunsen burner. He is so much more rounded than modern demi-gods: it is no wonder we will not let him die. But a sort of immortality is secured for Sherlock Holmes on a firmer basis than pure literary charisma. As the Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg has demonstrated, the detective techniques of Sherlock Holmes epitomise modern faith in scientific inquiry. The powers of deduction with which Holmes so frequently amazes Watson, and the stolid coppers of Scotland Yard, amount to a method of determining truth through minutiae: discarded cigar butts, scuffs on a boot heel, a singular ear lobe. As a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles, of things that the less observant overlook, Holmes aligns himself to Giovanni Morelli, who in the last century established the science of connoisseurship and attribution in art, by identifying unsigned Botticelli paintings according to the tiny anatomical similarities shared with figures in pictures actually signed by Botticelli; and Holmes joins Sigmund Freud, who revealed the subconscious as the fount of personality. Detective, art connoisseur, psychologist: each requires the same expertise of decipherment, each assumes that there are clues to knowledge which need interpretation. How many Sherlockologists are doctors I don't know: but MoreIIi, Freud and Arthur Conan Doyle all had medical backgrounds, and I imagine that Sherlock Holmes will remain popular for as long as we respect his model of clinical detachment.

text:  or a day's fly fishing on the Kennet - will go to whoever can present credible evidence of having caught, by fair angling means, a specimen of Salvethymus Svetovidovi, otherwise known as Svetovidov's long-finned char. This is undoubtedly the most challenging angling contest ever devised, and I am pretty confident the prize will go unclaimed. For there are certain obstacles to the pursuit of this creature, which - in fairness to the more adventurous readers of this column - I should outline. For one thing, the fish is unique to one lake in the entire world. It is called El'gygytgyn, and it is situated in Central Chutotoka. Quite where Chutotoka is, I am not sure. Somewhere in eastern Siberia, perhaps. Wherever it is, Lake El'gygytgyn is not likely to figure on the tourist agenda. According to my information - gathered from a translation of a learned Russian treatise - it is frozen solid for all but two months of the year. The climate is described as extremely harsh and the fauna as extremely sparse ; scienceSpeak for a God-forsaken, wind-whipped, snow-bound, ice-encrusted hellhole of a place. Assume, however, that the intrepid angler actually manages to find El'gygytgyn during its ice-free summer. The problems are only just beginning. The long-finned char prefers to swim at a depth of 150 feet or more. In addition it is a demersal planktivore , which means - I think - that it is most unlikely to snap at a spinner or bait even if means could be devised to get them down to it. At this point I will leave it to the expert. I have not been to Lake El'gygytgyn, nor would anything induce me to do so. But I can claim to be one of the few fishermen in England - possibly the only one - to have seen Svetovidov's long-finned char in the flesh. I can exclusively report that they are very small, very dark, with a very few tiny spots, and long fins. The only interesting thing about them is that they are the first new specimen of salmonid to be identified in recent times. For this Anatoly Nikolayevich Svetovidov, who first trawled one from El'gygytgyn's frigid depths, will be honoured by ichthyologists, if not by anglers. I saw, and indeed touched, this rare creature in the basement of the Natural History Museum, whence it had just arrived in a bottle of preserving alcohol from the Soviet Union. I had gone there at the kind invitation of the senior scientific officer, Gordon Howes, to learn something of the habits of the giant European catfish; and to delve into the legends associated with this mysterious and disgusting freshwater monster. It is difficult, however, not to be sidetracked when one is surrounded by the world's greatest collection of preserved fish, some of which date back 300 years and more. It was not long before I was peering over Howes' shoulder into the dusty cabinets on whose shelves the fishes of the world gleam in their multitudes, heads down or standing on their tails in their jars of fluid. I asked him about the Goliath Tigerfish. I had caught the ordinary tigerfish on the Zambesi and in Lake Kariba, and had heard tales of a gigantic cousin, of unparalleled fierceness, to be found somewhere in the darkest jungle or densest bush of Central Africa. Had Mr Howes heard of it? He smiled gently, and produced a jar the size of a coalscuttle in which a mighty fish was suspended, jaws agape, vicious teeth glinting. It was enough to fire visions of tangling with the beast in some unexplored tributary of the Upper Congo. Among other river predators, Howes showed me an Amazonian fish which made the piranha look no more threatening than Charlie Bubbles, our lethargic goldfish. He scooped it from its bottle to display its oral weaponry. From its lower jaw rose two fangs so long that Nature had provided holes through the top of its snout to contain them. This was Hydrolocus, the wolf-fish, a creature of nightmares. We went to Howes' office. I glimpsed a dissected cod under a microscope. On another table was a minute butterfly fish from Indonesia, collected by Mungo Park. Before giving me a friendly, fishy handshake, Howes presented me with a scientific paper arguing that rainbow trout had been wrongly classified. I reeled out into the spring sunshine, exhilarated by the unusual experience of acquiring learning. A few weeks ago the BBC showed a sobering film - in which Howes appeared - on the devastating impact of spending restrictions on the Natural History Museum's research programme. I cannot argue that the possession of 750,000 dead fish in bottles is of much practical use to anyone. But the collection does represent knowledge, and it reflects to the nation's credit. It, and those who tend it, deserve honour and protection.

text:  A SPLENDID party took place this week in the garden of St James's Square, in London. Some hundreds of authors, publishers, reviewers, and  - most importantly - readers gathered, with their guests and staff, to celebrate the literary world's best-loved institution. The Queen Mother was also there. For this month marks the 150th anniversary of the founding of the London Library. Other events will follow. The Antiquarian Booksellers Association is arranging a small exhibition at a book fair at the Park Lane Hotel, London, from June 25 to 27. In October the library has arranged a series of seven lectures in which distinguished members will talk about predecessors - Noel Annan on Carlyle, Lord Quinton on Milnes, AS Byatt on George Eliot and GH Lewes, John Julius Norwich on Kipling, Kenneth Rose on Harold Nicholson, AN Wilson on Rose Macaulay, and John Wells on Some Former Librarians. A commemorative medallion has been struck, available from the librarian at Pounds 49.50 in bronze and Pounds 98.50 in silver. Later in the year Macmillan will publish a history of the library by John Wells. Entitled Rude Words, and described as discursive, it is unlikely to be the usual dull corporate panegyric. The library owes its existence to the indignation of that bad-tempered genius, Thomas Carlyle. The lack of books had made his childhood in Scotland seem like prison, but when he reached London, he found things little better. The greatest city in the world had no public libraries and books were expensive. True there was the British Museum, but Carlyle chafed at the rule which confined the books to the premises. Carlyle shamed writers to raise money, donate books, help design a sensible catalogue and recruit members. The library's first auditor was William Thackeray.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Gardening: Seed-time mysteries laid bare - Now is the the time to lay the foundations for a cheap summer in the garden - with or without expert help PR 
text:  IN THE next fortnight, you can lay the foundation for a cheap summer in the garden. The weather has turned in your favour and has remembered how to rain; the effort is minimal and the skill is not much greater. You need some seed-packets, a rake, and a will to experiment. If you need somebody to talk you through it, we have a new dialogue of experts to help us. The dialogue is conducted by Christopher Lloyd and Graham Rice, and is published as Garden Flowers from Seed (Pounds 17.99, Viking). They do not hold a dialogue as Socrates seems to have understood one, a sort of bullying match in which the senior expert, Christopher Lloyd, is allowed to tie a younger questioner into knots. Instead, both partners exchange views without too many disagreements, but in a chatty tone which may not suit all readers. The result is a double-edged insight into some of gardening's great mysteries. Over them all hangs the really big puzzle: why will some seeds grow so easily, while others sit and sulk? There are lesser mysteries on the way through: why do petunia seedlings sometimes fizzle out? Why should you never sow mallows in the same place, year after year? Why do some verbenas germinate, and others come to nothing? What are the ground rules for Bizzy Lizzie if you do not wish to buy it in June at more than Pounds 1 a plant? Fortunately, both partners in the dialogue seem to agree with my favourites. They merely disagree about one of the methods. This weekend, I will be sowing seeds directly into open ground, the simplest of all procedures. Loosen up a bare patch of earth; rake it over; press it with the back of the rake to make a series of straight seed-drills about half an inch deep. Arrange these straight drills at various angles so that you do not end up with nothing but a straight, long line. Sow the seeds directly and press the soil back over them with gentle pressure from the rake's head, holding the rake itself upright. Follow Rice and disagree with Lloyd, who prefers to broadcast the seed irregularly. I find this habit extravagant and harder to control as its results progress. Most varieties no longer need a greenhouse in May and certainly do not need daily attention. You can sow them on a Saturday afternoon, water them again on a Sunday evening, if the weather is hot, and forget the entire escapade until the next weekend but one or two. By then, seedlings ought to be showing. My first instinct is to make a beeline for the blues: Love in a Mist (the Miss Jekyll variety) and dark blue Phacelia. The experts agree on my experience, that both of these transplant badly, like poppies or mignonette. You need to leave a few plants in each seed-drill without disturbance, having thinned out their unwanted neighbours a week or so after germination. I am also fond of the easy Echium Blue Bedder, although Lloyd complains that it only lasts for two or three weeks. I find that it will pull itself together for a second season if you cut it very hard after the first flowering. Among tall varieties, we all agree on Malope, the big mallow, but it is not often stocked in shops' seed-racks. I also like rose-lilac Agrostemma, which Lloyd shrewdly suggests as a good pot-plant: you have to stake it when young in order to agree with him. It is not clear what the experts think about the bright white Lavatera Mont Blanc. Lloyd complains about it, but the book gives it a glamorous full-colour plate. Rice is good on the purple-flowered Swan River Daisy, which he wisely recommends for hanging baskets because it will put up with drought. It needs heat, however, in order to germinate. What, finally, about seed-boxes and composts? I use old Flora Margarine boxes or the small plastic pots in which plants come nowadays from nurseries. The experts agree, surely rightly, that pots are more convenient, as you can sow many more varieties in a small space. Do not bother with big plastic trays. The days have also passed in which we had to use wooden seed-boxes, fresh from fishmongers and smelling of kippers. On composts, the two of them are still stuck with peat, but mostly as part of a general compost. Personally, I have never used peat at all. I have preferred good top-soil from the garden, which is carefully sieved, like flour, and mixed with leaf-mould and sharp sand. I have also used vermiculite and perlite, both of which help seeds to germinate: however, both of them persist in the soil afterwards, and seedlings anyway need something stronger very soon. A very few, very difficult seeds perhaps need peat to hold water and keep the surrounding soil open, but I must insist that my peat-free successes have included seed of gentians, hardy cyclamen and various lilies. Some while ago, I also gave up buying bags of special seed-compost because it becomes lumpy when it is watered and it is too fine to handle easily. As an amateur, my reasoning is much simpler. When nature sows seeds, she drops them in all manner of rough, uneven earth; when I sow outdoors, I make seeds put up with whatever the flower bed already offers. Why go mad on peat because you happen to be sowing the same bedding-plants in a pot or margarine box? I win some, lose some, but so (I suspect) do the peat-fanciers. The one cloud on the horizon is that my traditional laziness is now ecologically pure. But that is a prejudice for another time.

Within months of the purchase the planned sale of the new owners' business fell through and the house had to be offered for resale privately. Many visitors and countless trips to the bank later, the house was finally sold earlier this year for just Pounds 2.5m - a 100 per cent discount before costs on what the vendor admits to have been, in retrospect, a reckless price. A London Docklands' penthouse - bought with an 80 per cent staff bank mortgage for Pounds 475,000 in June 1987. The keys were posted to the lenders mid-1990 by the Australian owner who left London six months after being laid off by the bank. He'd simply given up trying to keep pace with loan costs. The flat was re-sold for Pounds 285,000 earlier this year, a 40 per cent discount on the purchase price. The lender has accepted that the gap between the mortgage plus rolled-up interest charges and the resale price has to be written off. A substantial North London detached house - bought for Pounds 875,000 in June 1988. Re-offered for sale at 'over Pounds 900,000' in March 1990, the price was cut to Pounds 825,000 in June 1990 and cut again to Pounds 750,000 by new agents in September 1990. It was re-marketed on the basis of 'offers over Pounds 700,000' last October and was subject to a bid at Pounds 710,000 that month. Before the owners had time to put away the celebratory champagne, that offer fell through. The house was finally sold for Pounds 740,000 in February this year after the owners had initially received two identical offers of Pounds 725,000. The sale represents an 18 per cent discount on the purchase price after two and a half years of costs and a near divorce. A 1950s semi-detached former council house bought on a 40 per cent discount by the tenants for Pounds 42,000 in December 1988. Resold in a lot with six other houses and flats at auction by the mortgagees after a repossession sale for Pounds 35,000 in May 1990, and resold within days by the trader-purchaser for Pounds 68,000 - in line with its estimated market value two and a quarter years ago. Private resales in flat blocks where the owner has to compete with developer sales - no developer discounts or offers special mortgage rates, so the only sale incentive is price. The best of the Docklands flats in Wapping and the Isle of Dogs - now discounted to levels that offer double-figure returns in a lively rental market. The supply of waterfront flats is thin after two years with no new schemes and anyone able to take a three to four year view on values should see substantial capital growth. Fully modernised family homes in prime central London - never out of fashion and increasingly back in demand. West Country and Hereford houses - an area too far away for Londoners who cannot work some of the week at home, but who bought anyway in the late 1980s. The cheapest Costa del Sol flats - there is virtually no holiday resale market for these now and new developments aim to provide far larger and better quality accommodation but there is growing local demand for staff and low cost housing, and no supply. Repossession properties - with professional advice only from auctions. Beware the long unsold property re-branded as a 'no offers bargain'. That's often a way of attracting scavenger bidders without any change to the asking price. Also beware of priced properties, since every property for sale in the country has been termed 'realistic' in recent months whether it is cheap, fairly valued or outrageously over-priced. 'Guide prices' can be equally misleading as the term might best be described as a figure reflecting hope over experience; it's left to the buyer discover whether that's a vendor's hope over agency's experience, or not.

text:  FOR MORE than a century Northern Ireland has had an influence in the rose world totally out of proportion to its size. For much of that time this was due to the Dickson and McGredy families growing and breeding roses there. Even when Sam McGredy transferred all his rose breeding to New Zealand, the stream of fine new roses from Northern Ireland continued to flow from Pat Dickson. Something about the climate here and maybe also about the soil seems specially favourable for roses; an equability of temperature combined with an abundance of atmospheric moisture that seems to give rose blossoms a little extra quality and clarity of colour. Maybe there is an element of sentiment in this view but I have heard many rose experts express it. In 1964 the Rose Society of Northern Ireland was founded as a totally separate organisation and in 1981 the RSNI was accepted as a member of the World Federation of Rose Societies. The appropriate reward is that, this year, the World Federation has chosen Northern Ireland as the country to host its ninth World Rose Convention and has arranged a very full and attractive programme of events to be held before, during and after the Convention under the title Rose Emerald 1991. The Convention itself will take place in Belfast between Monday July 15 and Sunday July 21 and will be centred in Queen's University where there will be lectures and exhibitions. Two rose shows will be staged here exclusively for new roses exhibited by international rose breeders and two more shows will be for both new and old roses. Since 1965 the city of Belfast Rose trials have been held in the Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park and are judged every year by an international panel of rose experts. Rose Emerald 1991 is timed to coincide with the closing stages of this year's judging of these ongoing trials and there will be a conducted tour of them for convention delegates. Other visits and tours have been arranged for Convention Week: a civic reception hosted by Belfast City Council at City Hall, Belfast; a Government Reception at Greenmount College, Antrim; a gala banquet at Europa Hotel, Belfast; an Irish night in association with the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland, also at the Europa Hotel; and a Gala Concert in association with Ulster Television. Among the tours arranged during the convention is one to Mount Stewart House and Gardens which I would specially recommend for this is a remarkable place; a fine 18th century mansion with a very large garden much of which was planned and planted after 1920 by the Seventh Marchioness of Londonderry. It is highly original in design, very beautiful and contains a number of unusual plants. July is an excellent month to see it. It is also a good time to see many other gardens and the organisers of Rose Emerald 1991 have taken advantage of this to plan three tours, one to take place the week before the convention and two more the week following it. The first of these will start in London on Sunday July 7 and travel northwards visiting the Royal National Rose Society's large display garden and trial grounds near St Albans and finishing in Glasgow on July 15 in good time to get to Belfast the following day. Among the gardens to be visited on the way are Blenheim Palace, Chatsworth House, Harlow Carr, which is the garden of the Northern Horticultural Society, and the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. After the convention delegates can return for a further four days min England, starting at Kew Gardens on Monday, July 22 and then spending a whole day at the Royal National Rose Society's garden at St Albans, another day in the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley and then a day in Oxford with a further opportunity to look at Blenheim Palace and its strongly contrasted formal and landscape gardens. The alternative, post-convention tour is in southern Ireland, starting and finishing in Dublin and lasting a week from July 22 to 28. The gardens to be visited include the spectacular Powerscourt among the Wicklow Mountains and also a unique Japanese Garden at Tully House, Kildare. It also includes much of the finest south western coastal scenery and passes through Glengarriff from which launches ply to tiny Garinish Island entirely filled by a superb garden partly in Italian style, and with dramatic scenery but one that has never acquired the mansion that was originally planned for it. Full particulars of all these events can be obtained from Rose Emerald 1991, 31 Spa Road, Ballynahinch, Co Down, Northern Ireland BT24 8PT. Tel: 0238-561993.

text:  'MAJORCA? Ma-jor-ca?' People pronounce the name quizzically, then narrow their eyes and curl their lips a little as you explain to them why you have been there twice in the last year and can't wait to return when the next off-peak season arrives. We all know that Majorca is the single most popular holiday destination for the British - upwards of 1.6m of them go there. So it seems like a dereliction of duty to join the massed hordes in search of sun and sangria in the Balearics instead of heading towards a newly-discovered retreat in Bulgaria or Guinea-Bissau. Yet the vast majority of British tourists are content to huddle together in one small part of what is still, paradoxically, a secret island. They clutter a 50-mile south-western stretch of Majorca's 200-mile coastline in high summer, and do not seem aware that even a short walk inland would reveal another island entirely. No Watneys beer on tap, no hotels that look like Sing-Sing and offer gala nights. Instead, there is a remarkable landscape filled with orange and lemon groves, mountain ranges, bays and inlets, orchids, almond blossom, pine forests, rare birds and superb walks. The ground-rules for enjoying this other Majorca are simple: ignore July and August, avoid the concrete jungles around the Bay of Palma, alternate the beach life with adventurous walks and pack a copy of Landscapes of Mallorca by Valerie Crespi-Green. The island, shaped like a conch shell, owes its remarkably pleasant climate to two ranges of craggy mountains, the Tramuntana along the north coast and the Llevante on the east coast. These protect the inland areas against cold winds and offer shade for the plains full of orange and lemon orchards and olive trees. To enjoy the contrasts of Majorca I split my stay between a small hotel, the Mar y Vent, in the secluded fishing village of Banalbufar on the west coast, and a larger hotel, the Bon Sol, in Illetas, just 8km outside Palma. These hotels are family-run, now a rarity in Majorca as in many other places. Banalbufar is so small that most tourists drive right through it, which is good news for those who stay at the Mar y Vent. The Vives family has been running the hotel since 1932 and its superb location makes it ideal for those who want to explore the area on foot. Banalbufar teeters on cliff edges and the hotel is perched on a hillside overlooking the sea. The village has the best example of Majorca's remarkable stone-stepped terraces which cover the hills in many parts. These terraces originated with the Moorish occupation and are an ingenious aid to growing fruit and tomatoes. A comfortable hotel and access to good walking routes are the two essential ingredients for a successful break in Majorca. Exertion by day and self-indulgence by night make an ideal combination. The Bon Sol in Illetas caters for this kind of balanced regime. It looks like a well-preserved Spanish country house with traditional architecture, objets d'art rescued from monasteries, antique furniture and flourishing gardens dotted with cacti and palm trees. It feels like a large private house because that is what it was before it became a hotel in 1953. The ebullient owner, Martin Xamena, and his English wife tell the story of how Martin's father built the Bon Sol on a deserted site overlooking the sea, surrounded by pine woods, years before the Palma area became a tourist centre. Despite its 100 rooms, it still feels more like a friendly country mansion than a hotel. The Bon Sol is an ideal base for walkers. If you have a hired car you can drive to the starting-point of nearby walks or (as I did) use a combination of the excellent local bus services and cheap taxis. Valerie Crespi-Green, an Englishwoman who has lived on the island for many years, is adding some new walks for a new edition of her Landscapes of Mallorca, so we took up the challenge to road-test one of the new routes with her. We met in Deya, high in the mountains, where the rugged landscape and superb sea views have attracted writers and artists for years. Robert Graves lived here from the 1930s until his death and is buried in the village cemetery. Valerie Crespi-Green grades all her walks, ranging from easy to strenuous. Our route, Deya to Soller, was over five miles but I was relieved to learn that it was rated as ideal for beginners (my own grade) because of the absence of steep climbs. Much of the walk was over ancient cobblestones, using the old path that used to be the only trail for locals to ride from Deya to Soller. We followed the author's written directions and found them clear and accurate. During the two-hour walk we did not see another soul. With only the occasional sheep-bell to break the silence and the sight of an odd goat munching away outside a deserted 13th-century chapel, it was strange to realise that we were not so far from the saturated tower blocks of Magaluf and Arenal. Wild orchids, euphorbia, Balearic crocuses, clematis and violets lined the route, which has dramatic views of the coastline and mountains, including the highest peak on the island, Puig Major. According to a keen walker there are 650 muscles in the human body and every time you go on a decent walk you use 50 per cent of them: his words came back to me as we walked down to Soller, with its small fishing harbour and clattering wooden train that runs to Palma. We took the narrow-gauge railway that hugs the orange groves so tightly that you can almost pick the fruit as you judder along. Back at the Bon Sol we had the chance to sample authentic local cooking with Martin and Lorraine Xamena as our guides. They took us along hairpin bends and up a corkscrew road to a village called Genova where the Na Burguesa restaurant has a spectacular view over the Bay of Palma. Majorcan food is ideal for trenchermen - or anyone who works up an appetite after a healthy walk. Pa omb oli is the classic local starter: country bread covered with ham, olive oil and tomatoes. The robust wines go well with the house special, cordero al homo, leg of lamb. When they say leg, they mean leg. A complete leg or shoulder was served to everyone. For my last walk I was content to pack a rucksack with some freshly-baked bread and cold meats, oranges and a bottle of local white. We took the bus from Palma to Puerto Pollensa in the north of the island, a quiet resort with wide beaches that has managed to hold off the greediest developers. The walk from Puerto Pollensa through the Boquer valley is one of the most popular in Valerie Crespi-Green's book: six kilometres of rugged landscapes, pines, jagged cliffs and a windy valley that is popular with keen bird-watchers ('twitchers') because of the many rare birds that can be seen. Twitchers from all over Europe regularly take this walk because of the chance to glimpse black-eared wheat-eaters, rock-thrushes, kestrels, peregrines, even the scops owl. One twitcher told me that the biggest thrill of his fortnight in Majorca was catching sight of Eleonora's falcon and a Marmora's warbler. I can hardly tell a robin from a raven but we did spot a vulture swooping along the mountainside. The walk ends in an isolated cove with the enormous rock of Es Colomer jutting out from the Formentor coastline. As we sat on rocks at the cove and let the waves cool our feet, I laid my bottle of white wine in a rock pool. Within a few minutes it was chilled enough to drink and ready us for the return journey.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Travel: A good place to hear yourself think - The wilds of Scotland's Ardnamurchan peninsula 
text:  SCENE I: It is 5pm on a late-April Sunday and I am sitting at a place near the end of the Ardnamurchan peninsula in the north-western highlands of Scotland, gazing across a short stretch of sea into the mouth of the Sound of Mull. The sun is out and the sea only gently tousled by the wind. Mull itself is coloured like a painting by an Australian Impressionist: blue, black, grey, fawn and the colour that is not green and not black but somewhere in between. In the right foreground is a small bay with grass growing up to the shingle and sheep and lambs wandering eccentrically among the rockpools. In the left foreground is the toy ruin of Mingary castle, or at least the ruin of the small part of it that survives, toy-like and forgotten. I think: perhaps what I am enjoying - the view, the quiet, the orderliness - is what is called serenity, for the view across to Mull has only ever been interrupted or in any great way modified by volcanoes and glaciers, and then not recently, so that what I am looking at probably pre-dates human consciousness. I think this to be the case because I am not the sort of person who believes that things only exist - saucepans, Scottish landscapes - if there is someone there to observe them. What exists, I am sure, is blue, black, grey, fawn and the colour that is not black and not green. Scene II: 10am the following day. It is cold and not inspiring. I am at the lighthouse at Ardnamurchan point, the most westerly tip of the British mainland. It must be charming in the summer but in late April it is bleak and gale-swept. To the north-west are the islands of Muck, Eigg and Rhum; beyond, Canna, Barra, South Uist and Benbecula. The Ardnamurchan lighthouse was built in 1849 by Robert Louis Stevenson's uncle. Nowadays the ground and out-buildings - but not the lighthouse tower  -are owned by Peter de Savary, the property developer and America's Cup challenger, who also owns Land's End and John o'Groats and thus holds sway over the most southerly, northerly and westerly tips of Britain. On my way down to my car I peer into a small wind-shielded ravine and notice a scattering of primroses gleaming so luridly and unexpectedly that they might have been borne there by interstellar gusts. I think: what strangeness is it in his nature that compels a hot-shot like de Savary to buy up the most southerly, northerly and westerly points of Britain? I could ring him on his car-phone and ask him to explain. But then I think: he probably wouldn't know, is too rich to care, is rich enough, at any rate, to regard the question as far more odd than any possible answer. Scene III: I am now at Glenborrodale Castle, a luxury hotel (also owned by de Savary) which is halfway along the peninsula and surrounded by magnificent gardens. I am reading a small book by Jimmie Macgregor - Macgregor Across Scotland, BBC Books, Pounds 4.99 - in which the wee pundit describes walking from the Scurdie Ness lighthouse near Montrose on the Scottish east coast to the Ardnamurchan light on the west, and calls Ardnamurchan 'an almost perfect place.' He is right, for the peninsula is wild and beautiful, a haven for all sorts of creatures - wildcat, otter, golden eagle, pine marten, badger  - though not immune to the influence of 'incomers,' people moving in from England and pushing up property prices which means that the locals have to leave and the old crofting ways die. According to Macgregor: 'The oft-proffered argument that there are many Scots in England is a weak one. There are 5m Scots and 50m English, and the fact is that Scots go to England because they need money, and the English can move to Scotland because they have it.' I think: the arrival of incomers is inevitable and not at all tragic. Few of us live where we would most like to live (Palm Springs, in my case; Belgravia at a pinch). I think: If people in Scotland have to move south to earn some money then they are at liberty to move back again once they have made it. But then I think: that sounds like Norman Tebbit, which upsets me so violently I almost have an accident. Scene IV: I am now at Corran, at the eastern end of the peninsula, waiting for the ferry so that I can cross Loch Linnhe for the short drive to Fort William where I will catch the night train to London. It is a hobby of mine when waiting for transport to study the rules and conditions laid down by the transport company. The Corran ferry is operated by the Highland Regional Council, a cautious body to judge from its 'conditions of carriage,' two of which state: 'The Council shall be entitled in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason to refuse to receive or ship any goods or vehicle, or any part thereof, or any passenger. 'The Council are not liable for failure to operate the ferries at the scheduled times, or at all, and they are not liable for any loss, damage or injury resulting from delays, through whatever cause arising.' I think: that just about covers it.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Travel News: French breaks in demand 
text:  PETER Mayle may have done more for holidays in France than all the carefully-laid plans of clever advertising agencies, such as those for which he used to work. Mayle's book, A Year in Provence, and his newly-published Toujours Provence have apparently stimulated UK demand for French holidays. Travel agency Thomas Cook reports that holidays to France are running at a level 60 per cent higher than this time last year. A leading independent specialist, VFB Holidays, believes that Mayle has had a marked impact: a third of a sample survey of 5,000 clients it quizzed last year mentioned A Year in Provence as required reading, not just for Provence but for how it represented life throughout rural France. VFB says that while Provence and the Provence-Rhone regions are selling exceptionally well, the Cote d'Azur is not. Other French specialists, such as Kingsland Holidays and Allez France, also report that Provence is the star performer, although another specialist, La France des Villages, believes that Provence is too expensive for many Britons: the Burgundy region is its most popular destination. The overall holiday picture this summer is looking considerably brighter than had seemed likely earlier this year. Mass-market travel agent Lunn Poly says that trade has picked up sharply for Mediterranean package holidays. But up-market American Express Travel says that the anticipated post-Gulf war boom in bookings has not been as extensive as hoped. 'Independent travel in America, however, is doing very well,' says Barry Tyrell, Amex Travel's marketing director. The Association of Independent Tour Operators reports that Italy and in-land Spain are among the most popular destinations at present, with a resurgent interest in Cyprus. But it says that bookings for Greece and Turkey are still taking time to recover from the effects of the war. Perhaps Peter Mayle might be lured there by some enterprising tourist board? THE government's decision to open up Heathrow airport to all-comers, after years of restrictions, has given new opportunities to several carriers to compete more effectively against British Airways. Cathay Pacific, voted favourite airline of Holiday Which? readers, this week started a daily non-stop service to Hong Kong from Heathrow after 10 years' lobbying. Later this month, Owners Abroad is operating the first charter flight out of Heathrow for two decades: to Faro in Portugal.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Reminiscing over raki - Crete: The Battle and the Resistance by Anthony Beevor John Murray Pounds 19.95, 383 pages 
text:  FIFTY YEARS ago on May 20 the German parachute attack on Crete started one of the most bizarre - and moving - dramas of the Second World War, the short and disastrous Battle of Crete followed by the long, successful Resistance which tied down many German troops who could have been in Italy in 1943. Its high point is legend, filmed as Ill Met By Moonlight, when Patrick Leigh-Fermor's band captured General Kreipe, the commander of Heraklion, near Knossos, led him across snow-covered Mount Ida, and sent him off to Egypt in a submarine. The Germans set off thinking the Cretans would welcome them. But the Cretans had got rid of the Turks only 40 years before, after deeds of bravado and self-sacrifice such as when the Abbot of Arkadi in 1866 set fire to the monastery's powder magazine rather than surrender. Now it was the Nazis. The choice was the same: Freedom or Death. There was really no choice, even if the Cretan Division was stuck on the Albanian border. (Many times have I heard, over raki in the cafe, 'if only they had been here . . .') The old men, and women, and children, took up their farm tools and shotguns. The prisoners were let out. And the Germans thought it was unfair because the locals were not in uniform so they started reprisals, which strengthened the feeling against them. For the survivors of the motley group of British, Australian and New Zealand defenders of Crete, the memory of the courage, generosity and serious drinking of the Cretans does not fade. Ask those taken prisoner. On the long road to camp Cretans gave them food and drink constantly, even if it meant none for themselves. But British senior officers had been eager to get out and leave troops behind, as Evelyn Waugh showed in Officers and Gentlemen - partly in self-disgust, Antony Beevor explains. To Waugh, some of the British in Crete epitomised the collapse of behaviour and society during the war. When the first German fell from the sky, the Resistance began. And if the alliance was short of wirelesses and weapons, it was not lacking in spirit. They very nearly held Crete. German losses of crack troops were so high on the first day that they did not see how they could win. And they never again attempted a parachute attack, though the Allies continued till Arnhem. Unimaginative command, staying back and doing too little too late, lost the Allies Crete. The one moment of supreme advantage was when the invaders arrived. Yet there was no decision to hold Maleme airfield near Chania at any cost, and Hill 107 above it was abandoned on the first night when the Germans though they were lost. The First World War hero General Freyberg was so convinced that the main attack would be by sea that he misread accurate information from Ultra intercepts and held his reserves back in a campaign hardly longer than the land phase of the Gulf war. Crete was a major minor disaster, which Beevor analyses judiciously in this lucid, readable book which is set to become the standard work. Having tried its predecessors, I now at last understand what happened in the battle. It is also the first comprehensive account of the disruptive exploits of the dashing young men of the Resistance - Leigh-Fermor, Xan Fielding, archaeologists such as Tom Dunbabin and Terence Bruce-Mitford, Mikis Akoumianos (the son of Sir Arthur Evans' foreman) and Constantinos Mitsotakis, the present Greek PM. Beevor includes most of the stories but leaves out the strange moment of communion on Mount Ida when Kreipe started and Leigh-Fermor finished Horace's poem about Monte Soratte in snow. I also wanted more of the whiff of Crete, 'blood and slaughter and garlic' as Nicholas Hammond wrote later. Has Beevor sat in the sun on Mount Ida and heard an elder of Anoyia tell how, in court after the war, he killed the collaborator who had shot his brother and then walked over to the prosecutor and handed him his knife? Has he heard the cafe-owner's wife shrieking at the men for being sentimental about the Resistance when 'the Germans did not just kill our men, they killed the goats and shot holes in our olive oil tanks. Our village died for 25 years'? More time over the raki hearing the songs and legends which keep the war alive today would have made the book yet stronger. But we hope to find them one day in Patrick Leigh-Fermor's great yet-to-be written work on Crete. An exhibition called 'Touch and Go: the Battle for Crete, 1941' opens at the National Army Museum, Royal Hospital Road, London SW3 on May 17.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: To the leader born - A Question of Leadership: Gladstone to Thatcher by Peter Clarke Hamish Hamilton Pounds 17.99, 344pages 
text:  PETER CLARKE is a Cambridge historian with a distinctive style which lends itself easily to parody. His book on British leaders from Gladstone to Thatcher is not entirely new, since he has written some of the essays before in other places. Nor does it claim to be comprehensive: Clarke takes the view that some of those who did not quite make it to the top are at least as interesting as some of those who did. In other words, he picks and chooses, although the basis for the choice is not always entirely clear. There is said to be an after-dinner game of discussing who was the best British prime minister this century. That is rather a macro-affair, and anyway depends on definitions (what does one mean by best?) and a certain detachment from the subject. Clarke's approach is decidedly micro: he is very good at producing quotations, usually without the source. He has read widely and sometimes gives the impression of having borrowed heavily: for example, from DR Thorpe's book on Selwyn Lloyd. A more appropriate game to play with Clarke might be: which is his best essay in this collection? Some of his contributions are very good, though more by fits and starts than sustained writing. He is not without some good phrases of his own, unless one has missed the source. For instance, he describes Thatcher as rampaging from summit to summit 'as a sort of fishwife Britannia demanding her money back'. On Harold Macmillan's dismissal of Dean Acheson - who said that Britain had lost an empire and not found a role - as a 'conceited ass', Clarke writes: 'The notion that the emperor had no clothes, as seemed devastatingly obvious to these foreigners, was somehow regarded as capable of refutation by shutting one's eyes and thinking of Winston Churchill'. Clarke's best essay is on Neville Chamberlain. It takes a kind of courage to say, as Chamberlain did on being offered the Treasury: 'I remain convinced that I might be a great minister of health but am not likely to be more than a second-rate chancellor'. Clarke tells the story of Chamberlain's early years trying unsuccessfully to grow sisal in the Caribbean. Churchill did not know it until 50 years later and described Chamberlain when he heard it as 'a hard-bitten pioneer from the outer marches of the British Empire.' Gladstone and Thatcher had a great deal in common, writes Clarke, since both were moralists, though he acknowledges that Thatcher owed much to Enoch Powell: 'Enoch the Baptist,' as he calls him, rather than Enoch the parliamentary leper. There are lots of insights like that, and Clarke can be good on economic questions. He has, after all, written a book called The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, which he draws on here. His essays are in general very entertaining, though somewhat mannered. If he goes on like this, and can resist the temptation to be too clever by half, he will make an excellent newspaper columnist, of which he has most of the attributes already.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Genius with a capital G - Goethe: The Poet And The Age, Volume 1, 1749-1790 by Nicholas Boyle Oxford Pounds 25, 807 pages 
text:  HERE IS a biographical marathon, comparable in size to Ackroyd's Dickens and Holroyd's Shaw, but with much firmer control over the vast material. It is a most rewarding run for anyone, German-speaking or not, prepared to summon the stamina. The course begins in 18th century Frankfurt where Goethe was brought-up by his affluent, self-made father. Papa Goethe's early ambitions for his son lay in the law, which Goethe studied in Leipzig. He was also encouraged to travel and become an educated man. This takes him - and us - to various parts of what was still the Holy Roman Empire and to Switzerland, after which the volume is concerned with Goethe's existence in the Thuringian duchy of Saxe-Weimar. Goethe stayed there for much of his life, and this big volume, sub-titled The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790), is only half of the story. He is 40 when it ends, and he lived into his 80s. Part two, The Age of Renunciation, 1790-1832, is 'forthcoming'. When that appears, the pair of volumes will surely stand for many years as the definitive biography. Goethe was the first German literary man of universal importance. He wrote prose, poetry, fiction, drama (plays such as Faust, Goetz von Berlichingen, Iphigenia, Tasso, written primarily to be read rather than performed), travel-reporting, autobiography, letters. He excelled at all these genres, being adept in a wide variety of styles. Like Shakespeare, he unlocked the hidden resources of his native language for literature. He was the also the first German writer to be regarded by his contemporaries, and to regard himself, as a Genius with a capital G. He is a genius 'from top to toe' said one contemporary, implying that Goethe was 'incapable of acting arbitrarily'. Not only did Goethe have this impact on his own circle and on the wider public, he brought himself - more precisely, the Self - into literature in a revolutionary fashion. After publication of The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774, which made an enormous stir - young men committed suicide in droves in emulation of its hero - practically everything Goethe did and said was recorded by someone. To escape from his own cult Goethe left mercantile Frankfurt and the world of his parents for aristocratic Weimar. He became a courtier, a Privy Counsellor, an administrator. After a while he was raised in rank and put von in front of his name. His elevation enabled him to take on greater responsibilities. These included managing a mining project at Ilmenau, negotiating with other ducal principalities, attending committees concerned with public works and finance. He was well-paid for these non-literary labours, but Goethe did not thereby neglect his own writing. In his first period at Weimar he combined his official functions with the composition of several of his most famous works. One thinks of the American poet Wallace Stevens working full-time as a top executive of the Hartford insurance company or Eliot in charge of the foreign department at Lloyds Bank. Soon after he arrived in Weimar, Goethe started a relationship with a respectable Weimar lady, Frau Charlotte von Stein. Back home he had had his youthful flings with women - see Werther - but this affair was strictly platonic, taking the form of incessant letter-writing though the two parties lived within walking-distance of each other. Although highly attractive to women, Goethe deliberately abstained from sex during his early years in Weimar. He broke that long fast at the end of his time in Rome with an obscure young Italian woman. The precise details have here eluded Boyle. Only when Goethe returned to Weimar aged nearly 40 did he enter into a long-term sexual relationship. As the book ends, his mistress has born him a son but Goethe is not yet married to her. Hearing of the affair, Frau von Stein angrily breaks off communications, and then demands the return of all her letters. The Italian expedition permitted Goethe to indulge not only his love of women and the company of artists like Tischbein and Angelica Kauffmann, but also his love of painting and drawing; and it provided material for one of his most accessible books, translated several times into English, the Italian Journey. That journey represented the second great change of environment for Goethe described in this volume. It was one that had just as far-reaching consequences for his work as the first. In discussing these, Boyle places Goethe's poetry and fiction in various cultural contexts - philosophic, scientific, political - all of which over-lapped in a period astonishingly rich in intellectual development. Boyle also interrupts the flow of the biographical narrative to reconstruct the process of composition of each of Goethe's outpourings, with further comments on each work in more general terms. Some of the key terms stem from attitudes common to both English and German literature. Thus the English reader who is not at home in German has a few points of orientation. The word 'sentimental', for instance, is frequently cited, not in its modern pejorative sense, but in the sense Sterne implied in his title, A Sentimental Journey, meaning someone who reacts to everything he sees from the heart. Taken over by Goethe and his fellow writers, this kind of sentimental approach to life points to the literary movement known as German Sentimentalism. Some of its attitudes then re-appeared in Storm and Stress, the vogue-style that dominated much of the period. Another English writer who had a great influence in Germany was Defoe, particularly Robinson Crusoe. Although the hero of this novel is not a sentimentalist, he is 'the central point from which all structural lines radiate outwards', comparable to the monad in the philosophy of Leibniz - a concept crucial to much German imaginative writing in this period. These gross simplifications of Boyle's subtle but never obscure line of exposition will perhaps give an indication of the richness of thought to be sampled in this book. It is a major contribution to the history of ideas in addition to revealing, in much greater detail than hitherto, the extraordinary story of Goethe's life.

text:  SELECTED POEMS Derek Mahon Viking Pounds 14.00. 194 pages LOVE IN A LIFE Andrew Motion Faber Pounds 11.99 hardback, Pounds 4.99 paperback, 62 pages LIKE LOUIS MacNeice, Derek Mahon is an Irish poet (born in Belfast, 1941) who eludes characterisation by his Irishness. His subjects are general, his sensibility is that shared by all poets whose primary interest is in making a variety of verbal objects and thereby, as he writes in the MacNeice memorial poem which heads this new selection, 'keeping the colours new'. Mahon's Irish interests are not repressed - in fact they are abounding; but unlike his near-contemporary Seamus Heaney or Paul Muldoon (another devotee of MacNeice) he does not seek to create an Irish myth of any sort. Interested in everything, and infallibly interesting, he is simply and thoroughly a poet in a way that not only recalls MacNeice, but the distinctions of Auden, Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop too. Like all those poets he is blessed with technical accomplishment. His management of metrics, stanza and rhyme, his sure sense of the fine, ringing, quirky, inevitable line, his eager appetite for, and seemingly instant command of, new forms set him apart from most of his English and American contemporaries, and they, on the whole, are a brilliant lot. Reading through this book - his second selected volume, but with the feel of a 'Collected' - one cannot fail to admire Mahon's knack of being himself in whatever formal guise he adopts, be it epigram, short lyric, verse letter, villanelle, dramatic monologue, free translation (Ovid, Corbiere, Rimbaud, Pasternak, Jaccottet) or big stanza-statement poem. Every piece here is fully achieved; the ambition behind the book must be enormous but is never obtrusive. Beyond the attributes of technique there is in Mahon's best poems an endlessly ponderable richness of language, a sense of which may be gained from the opening stanza of his most celebrated piece, 'A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford': 'Even now there are places where a thought might grow - /Peruvian mines, worked out and abandoned /To a slow clock of condensation, /An echo trapped for ever, and a flutter /Of wild-flowers in the lift-shaft, /Indian compounds where the wind dances /And a door bangs with diminished confidence, /Lime crevices behind rippling rain-barrels, /Dog corners for bone burials; /And in a disused shed in Co. Wexford'. This poem expands on what might be thought of as Mahon's principal theme: the pathos of discarded things, the poetry of the contingency of everyday objects. 'Left to itself,' he writes in 'Disused Shed's' sister-poem, 'A Garage in Co. Cork', 'the functional will cast /A death-bed glow of picturesque abandon'. The poet's visionary task is no longer to descry Wordsworth's noble 'light that never was, on sea or land', so much as to notice the 'late sacramental gleam' with which the most mediocre bits and pieces of life will start to shine. 'We might be anywhere but are in one place only', he insists in this Elizabeth Bishop-like reverie on an obscure, mundane filling-station, into which he nevertheless manages to work, and charmingly, the Ovidian myth of Philemon and Baucis. 'A god who spent the night here once rewarded /Natural courtesy with eternal life - /Changing to petrol pumps, that they be spared/ For ever there, an old man and his wife'. It is one of the triumphs of Mahon's art that for all his resolute attention to the ordinary, he can be 'myth-kitty' in a powerfully plausible way to which Philip Larkin who coined the phrase could not reasonably have objected, as when in the book's grand finale, 'Death and the Sun', he imagines 'Plato's neolithic troglodyte /Released from his dark cinema' standing at last, 'Absurd and anxious, out in the open air', while (in a wonderful concluding flow of mixed metaphor) the 'Sun gongs its lenity from a brazen heaven /Listening in silence to his rich despair'. If Mahon in this hugely enjoyable gathering of poems shows himself to be free from any Irish stereotyping, the quintessentially English poet Andrew Motion in his bleakly impressive new collection, Love in a Life, gives the impression of wanting to emulate the linguistic violence and tonal daring of his Irish contemporaries Paul Muldoon and Tom Paulin. A bitter colloquialism constantly threatens the poised lyrical structures of the book's three short sections and actually causes 'The Vision of that Ancient Man' to abort: it ends 'like . . . Sod it; who cares?' But in breaking with traditional values, Motion gives striking expression to a burdened breadwinner's view of the modern world as endlessly aggravating, rawly inhospitable. The sad old whippet in 'It is an Offence' who regularly leaves his 'sloped, weary turds' by the poet's front door 'doesn't know he's doing, and yet /I'd still like to cover his arsehole with quick-set cement'. That is very much the mood of the book.

You're stuck in the ice somewhere up near the North Pole. It has just got dark and isn't going to get light again for several months. You have managed to kill and eat a polar bear, but there wasn't anything in its stomach when you cut it up, and you have no idea where your next polar bear is coming from. What do you do? Put a message in a bottle, that's what. Throw it into the sea and hope someone will find it. They do, but not for another 48 years, which isn't what you had in mind at all. You have long since succumbed to The Terrors of Ice and Darkness, to the miseries of scurvy, a slow death by starvation and numbing, bitter cold. Not only that, but your story is true as well, dressed up as fiction by Christoph Ransmayr. He has taken the logbook and private diaries of a long-forgotten polar journey - the Austro-Hungarian expedition of 1873, which discovered Franz-Josef Land - and grafted onto them a fictitious retracing of the Austrians' steps, allegedly undertaken by a young Italian in 1981. Mazzini is the Italian's name, a lorry driver and part-time writer, who since childhood has dreamed of little except exploring. Fired by an account of the earlier expedition, he abandons home and job and sets off for Oslo, determined to follow the same route as his predecessors. Well-wishers try to dissuade him, but Mazzini is adamant. He heads north - the account of his journey is interspersed with reports of the genuine journey - and disappears, never to be seen again. The way Ransmayr tells it, he may be out there still, his frozen corpse just waiting to be discovered. Gripping stuff, although it has to be said that the novel works best when the author is dealing with the genuine expedition, quoting verbatim from an appalling account of privation and despair, rather than with his fictional additions. But the story is no less interesting for that. It is the sort of book that will be enjoyed best under a warm blanket, with food on the table, a cup of cocoa to hand, and the central heating turned up. Still in sombre mood, A Solitary Grief, by Bernice Rubens, tells the tale of psychiatrist Alistair Crown, who is reduced to despair when his only child is born with Down's Syndrome. He reacts, as many parents would, with horror at first, than with anger and resentment. 'They're very affectionate children,' the nurse tells him at the hospital, but Alistair doesn't want to know. He cannot even bring himself to look at his daughter's face, let along accept responsibility for her. He leaves home instead, has an affair with another woman, moves in with one of his patients - an abnormally hairy man named Esau, who has come to terms with his own deformity . . . Yet Alistair loves the child. He goes in to her at night, spending time alone with her in the dark, cradling the face he has never seen. He loves his daughter in secret, unwilling to admit his love even to himself, let alone his estranged wife. Nobody is more upset than he when the child goes missing and the police search the area for a body. He concedes at last that the girl is a part of him, his own flesh and blood. All of which makes A Solitary Grief sound fairly depressing, which it is, up to a point. But the author handles a difficult subject very well, without undue sentimentality, and brings the story to a suitably shattering climax. It is impossible in the end not to feel great sympathy for Alistair, even though he is far from being the hero of the piece. Paul Micou gained a reputation as something of a humorist with his first two novels, but has gone for a more restrained approach with his third, although his observation is as sharp as ever. The Death of David Debrizzi purports to be the biography - by his friend and teacher - of a young French concert pianist, a child prodigy who was internationally famous from a very early age. It takes the form of an open letter to a rival for Debrizzi's friendship, who has published a biography of his own. The rival's biography was biassed and self-serving in the extreme, an attempt to steal the credit for Debrizzi's success. Debrizzi's teacher sets the record straight, in a chapter by chapter rebuttal of the other's extravagant claims. What emerges between the two of them is a good portrait of the pianist, and of the concert world in general. The author is clearly a music buff and lets his enthusiasm shine through, telling a good story with considerable expertise. Not the End of the World is a first novel by Rebecca Stowe, a young American from Port Huron, Michigan. Her heroine is from Michigan too, a bright 12-year-old who wishes she was a boy, but will settle instead for becoming the first woman governor of the state. The story is one of childhood, of a rebellious girl with churchgoing parents and problems with teachers and social workers. It is a spritely tale, engaging enough as far as it goes. The only drawback is that the heroine's childhood doesn't appear to be any different from that of millions of other Americans, either in fact or in fiction. Last, but not necessarily least, Robert Coover's Pinocchio in Venice is a reworking of the children's story, with Pinocchio as an old man this time, returning to Venice after a lifetime in America as a college professor. He is anxious to complete his final work, a tribute to the Blue-Haired Fairy, before he turns back into wood again. The idea is an intriguing one, if you like that sort of thing, but the author's approach is heavily intellectual and some people may feel baffled by the length of his sentences, which routinely run to 250 words or more.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Confessions of an author - Patrimony: A True Story by Philip Roth Jonathan Cape Pounds 13.99, 238 pages 
text:  THE THINGS that wear you down are also the things that nurture your talent. For Philip Roth, those things are family matters. With Patrimony, he squares up to his father in an uncomfortable display of candour. This confessional writing follows Joseph Heller, William Styron and John Updike into the rediscovered country of one's past. It represents a new and growing American genre: established novelists deliver the psychic truth about themselves. Roth's story, however, is a piece of self-therapy too poignant to dismiss and too blatant to be endured. The family is not new Roth territory: he has been writing about Jewish families ever since his first novel, Goodbye, Columbus (1960). His characters have always, like Portnoy and Zuckerman, lived life not so much with their heart on the sleeve as in the full glare of open-heart surgery. But the intimacy they imposed made you feel prurient for being there. The same force works in Patrimony and in his previous confession, The Facts (1988). That feisty autobiography recorded the New Jersey upbringing, the college days at Bucknell and Chicago, and the relentless accumulation of material for his books. Here in Patrimony Roth brings his belief in Jewish family indivisibility to its natural term. He is confronted by an elderly father with a malignant brain tumour. The unstinting surgical detail, leavened only by sporadic wit, periodically gives way to a series of emotional encounters. Gradually the entropy of age and the inexorable tumour bring them closer; even false teeth: 'By taking the dentures, slimy saliva and all, and dumping them in my pocket, I had, quite inadvertently, stepped across the divide of physical estrangement that, not so unnaturally, had opened up between us once I had stopped being a boy.' His father had typified his time: a second- generation immigrant who lost money in shoes and frozen food before becoming an insurance clerk with Metropolitan Life. He was not only a family man, but president of an association of 80 Jewish families in Newark and 70 in Boston; the association Happy Day Fund took care of its sick, while its Education Fund helped with college tuition. In a bluff, point-blank way, he was immensely proud of his son. He defended Roth's books against Jewish charges of anti-Semitism and self-hate. And while his life was not spectacular, Roth's love for him makes it unique. The story moves to its inevitable end in Herman's death. But while father and son discuss the medical options presented by the growing tumour, the son suddenly finds himself in the theatre with a quintuple bypass operation. He tries to keep it from his father, and ends up in a tender family row. He recovers, relieved to think that his father will not have to bury a son. The book drips foreboding from every page. This is a grim, harrowing read. When the final hospital and mortuary scenes arrive, they are as depressing as Roth is elsewhere uplifting. He remarks coolly that with the unseemliness of his profession, he had been writing this book while his father lay ill and dying.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: The Young Lady says 'Yes]' - The 'most exhilarating thing to happen to Irish theatre in recent years' 
text:  WHEN DENIS Johnston's first play was turned down by the Abbey in the 1920's, he did some rewriting and changed the title to The Old Lady Says 'No]'. The joke was not lost on Dubliners. Lady Gregory, the old lady in question, was the Abbey. And to her mind an expressionist play like Johnston's was simply not Irish: it didn't have what she called 'PQ' - namely peasant quality. There is a recognisable truth behind this. In a sense even O'Casey is PQ transferred to the slums of Dublin. The formula produced masterpieces, like The Playboy and O' Casey's own early works. It also provided Ireland with a truly national theatre 60 years before Britain had one. But that does not alter the fact that it was a formula; and formulas may be creative initially but in the long term they stifle creativity. At the beginning of this year the Old Lady's place was taken by a Young Lady who is not likely to let herself be stifled. Garry Hynes is at 38 the most exhilarating thing to happen to the Irish theatre in recent years. A tiny woman with a will of iron, she is capable of dragging the Abbey into the 1990s, if anyone is. Her road to success was an unlikely one. Together with some contemporaries from University College, Galway, she founded the Druid Theatre in that city in 1975. They started in a school hall and then moved into a room behind a hotel. And it worked. 'My whole life in the theatre has been defined by a sense of place,' she has said 'and I cannot separate the act of theatre from the community in which it is performed.' The Druid developed a personal style of production, combining freshness and an agreeable roughness. Its greatest triumph was The Playboy, but it has also championed writers like Tom Murphy and Eugene McCabe. Garry Hynes then demonstrated that the Druid style could succeed outside her home city. Since 1986 she has been doing one production a year at the Abbey  -its current hit, The Shaughraun, is her work. She has also directed The Man Of Mode and The Look Of The Nightingale for the RSC, and her Royal Court production of Murphy's A Whistle In The Dark won the Time Out London Award for Direction in 1988. To discover the magnitude of the task facing her I spoke to Eintan O'Toole, critic of the Irish Times, whom Ms Hynes has brought in as Literary Advisor. He told me that the theatre had gone through a period of crisis since March 1985, when Joe Dowling resigned as Artistic Director. Some productions from the Dowling era were artistic and commercial failures, and the board of directors decided to play a more active role in day-to-day management. As a result, no Artistic Director was prepared to stay; there were five in a period of five years. The last, Noel Pearson, did much to get the theatre on its feet again, but his film work (he produced My Left Foot and The Field) took up an increasing proportion of his time. One result of the uncertainty was that the Abbey lost any sense of its role as an Irish National Theatre. 'The Abbey has tended to function on an Irish idea of genius,' O'Toole told me. 'There are geniuses out there who produce extraordinary work. This arrives on your desk and everybody says: Great, let's do it.' Astonishingly, this passive policy has to an extent worked; the geniuses have turned up. But, in the absence of a logical commissioning policy, many areas of Irish life remained uncovered. Garry Hynes, speaking of the community the Abbey should be addressing, defined it as 'a set of concentric circles moving out to the immediate context of Dublin itself, to the island as a whole - and in that I include the North - to the scattered Irish communities of Britain, the US and indeed the European Community.' This is a highly ambitious programme, probably realisable only in an ideal world. The initial list of productions is not wholly convincing: The Plough and The Stars, opening in the main theatre on May 7, is probably unavoidable with 1991 being the 75th anniversary of the Easter Rising: there is also a production in the smaller hall, the Peacock, of Tom Murphy's Rising play The Patriot Game, originally commissioned for BBC television but not produced. It opens on May 14. Dermot Bolder's The Lament For Arthur C1eary, already seen in the Peacock, is a first grappling with the themes of the new urban Ireland and the emigrant; but it is hard to see Hedda Gabler (June 25) as anything but a vehicle for Fiona Shaw. But it would be churlish to criticise Ms Hynes on such small evidence: we'll have a better idea of her stewardship this time next year. In the area of production, however, we shall soon be able to assess her impact. She is directing The Plough And The Stars, and everyone is looking for the qualities she has shown in the past: freshness of vision and the ability to create powerful theatrical images. Her work is marked by a sense of starting from scratch. Everything she does is a new beginning. And when you stand in the Abbey foyer, in the somewhat forbidding shadow of the portraits of the great figures from the past, you realise how important a new beginning is. Actors have to be persuaded to clear their minds of what FJ McCormick or Barry Fitzgerald or Cyril Cusack did and read the classical texts as though they had been written yesterday. The great bureaucratic establishment of the Abbey has to shake off its inertia. Garry Hynes, new Artistic Director of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Bluff King Hal, sunny side up / Enjoy a quirky view of Henry VIII 
text:  AT THE church of San Martino which overlooks the bay of Naples, the sharp-eyed English tourist discovers a disquieting view of our history. A faded fresco shows Henry VIII watching as a group of Carthusian monks are hanged, drawn, and quartered. The artist was more accurate than perhaps he knew. In 1535 Henry did indeed go to Tyburn Hill, with his Court, to watch the agony of those brave souls who dared to put their duty to God before their king. The map of Henry VIII's London had some exceedingly black spots, recently brought home to me by Susan Brigden's fine and deeply considered book, London and the Reformation (OUP Pounds 55; 676pp; forthcoming in paperback). There was Tyburn for traitors, Smithfield for the burning of heretics, and the Tower of London where so many of Henry's victims were racked and knelt to the executioner. But a few miles down-river from Traitors Gate, Henry's palace at Greenwich was a different world. Such is the impression left by Henry VIII at Greenwich, the provocative new exhibition at the National Maritime Museum (until 1 September; sponsored by the Sunday Express). Henry VIII at Greenwich is the star event of the Year of Henry VIII which commemorates the king's birth 500 years ago in June. However, the trouble with 'Bluff King Hal' from the marketing point of view is that the moment you go beyond the level of jokes about Henry's six wives, he becomes a tricky beast to package, especially abroad. The English Tourist Board must surely be relieved by the idiosyncratic focus which Dr David Starkey, distinguished historian of the Henrician court, has given the Greenwich show. You will find no reference to dismembered Carthusians, none to the fate of Thomas More - since 1935, St Thomas More as he is to Catholics. Of course, the difficulty with history is always knowing what to leave out. Dr Starkey's presentation is emphatically not the regular view of a reign, nor of a man. Imagine, for instance, what they would say at school to an essay on Henry which left out Cardinal Wolsey, Cromwell, the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and Parliament. Instead, Starkey gives a subtle presentation of Henry based on his times at Greenwich. The Maritime Museum is close to the site of the Tudor palace of Placentia, Henry's birthplace and his principal residence for two decades after fire destroyed the medieval palace of Westminster in 1512. However, royal life at Greenwich was largely about rest and recreation, banquets and hunting. So we find Henry sunny side up. Nothing today remains of the Tudor palace although the designers have struggled manfully to evoke its splendours. Dr Starkey has structured his view of Henry around events more-or-less connected with the palace - the Field of the Cloth of Gold, when Henry sallied forth to meet Francois I of France, is a bit of a jump. The French connection is strongly underlined. There are some splendid manuscripts from France and, for the first time, bilingual captions in French and English. Jousts, treaties, a royal christening, the New Year's Day present-giving ceremony, serve as the basis for 'historical tableaux' which group a very fine collection of paintings, miniatures, books, manuscripts, armour, and treasures. The detritus of domestic life is not forgotten either, with dog-collar and a tennis-ball found lodged in some rafters. Although I doubt whether the visitor on the hoof is likely to take it in, these ingenious tableaux lead us on a symbolic journey through the palace rooms. This conforms to the topographical analysis of power much in vogue with historians. Such matters become a good deal clearer if you buy the catalogue, a series of pithy, well-written essays with the title Henry VIII. A European Court in England. So we pass, in theory at least, from the Tilt-yard where magnificent armour evokes the great jousts of 1517, to the Royal Library, the Presence Chamber, and the Bedchamber. Here Henry's jousts between the sheets with his German such a flop. The cheery Henrician music stops at this point. Instead, in a slightly obvious crowd-pleasing strategem, we hear a reading from a memoir by Sir William Butts, the royal doctor. The king had protested to Butts that the fault was not his virility - he had experienced two wet dreams, a phrase left in Latin - but Anne's repulsive body. A portrait of poor, plain Anne from St John's College, Oxford is one of the exhibition's unexpected delights. The painting was considered a late copy until it was cleaned two years ago, and found to be 16th-century. It could even be one of the portraits produced for Henry's envoys to Cleves when the king was deliberating which of the two princesses there should be his fourth wife. The portraits were rejected on the grounds that German fashion did not reveal enough of a lady's anatomy. Holbein the Younger, Henry's court portraitist, was duly sent from London to record the lady although, as everyone knows, Holbein's genius made too much of the 'Flemish mare's' best points. Although Holbein's image of Anne was sadly not loaned to Greenwich, there are 14 of his beautiful drawings of Henry's courtiers from the Queen's collection. Nothing can overshadow Holbein's superb painted portrait of Sir Nicholas Carew in his armour, from the Duke of Buccleuch's collection. Carew, friend of Henry's gay youth, has a niche in the tableau which evokes the spectacular reception in 1527 for the ambassadors from Francois I. The pageantry comes across remarkably well, thanks to the Black Book of the Order of the Garter and the series of beautifully illuminated peace treaties which took artists and scribes three days to prepare. Again, I noticed how a focus on courtly junkettings ironed out the monster's wrinkles. Eleven years after he sat to Holbein, Carew was sent to the Tower accused of being a conservative. In prison he read the Bible in English and realised 'for the first time the sweetness of God's holy word.' Carew went to the block rejoicing in his conversion to the new faith. Carew's conscience may pass without comment, but at least the king's does not. In his famous psalter, he is represented as King David and meditating in his bedchamber. Less well-known is his boxwood rosary from the Chatsworth collection, carved for the king by a Flemish craftsman. Each bead of the Ave has five tiny roundels carved with texts and images of the sybils and prophets. The last bead, the Pater, is only the size of a golfball but it opens to show two devotional scenes carved in deep relief, one of the Virgin in glory. The Royal Clock Salt is huge and magnificent. Henry's personal suit of armour is awesome and, as ever, one marvels that the royal warhorse could even trot under all its gear. Yet of all the objects in this clever, cock-eyed exhibition, the rosary is surely the most intriguing. Huge old Henry, 54 inches round the waist, telling his beads in his palace beside the silver Thames; it may not be the dominant image left by Henry VIII at Greenwich, but it is there, all the same.

text:  FEW OF the Sony Radio Awards, presented last Monday, went to programmes I have written about, but this means neither that the judges' tastes are astray or that I have overlooked masterpieces each week. The Sony prizes cover a wider field of radio than any single writer could know, and rely on judges - 38 this year - each expert in his own field, as well as the Society of Authors, the Radio Academy and Smash Hits. The best education programme was Women and Aids from Radio Sussex; the best local station of the year was Radio Borders, from the Borders; the best rock programme was Cousin Matty from Radio City FM. The judges will have had tapes of the nominations and need never have hoisted aerial in Sussex or the Borders. Radio Stoke, whose new serial (heard on tape) I mentioned last week, won a Sony award with On the Street for outstanding service to the community. The awards tell usefully of the varying calibre, and the growing amount, of radio all over the country. One award few would oppose was Woman's Hour as the best magazine programme - few, that is, but the Controller of Radio 4, who has been talked out of changing its name but not out of shifting it to the morning later in the year. 'Service to the community' can be a broad function. Radio 4's programmes about bullying at work certainly qualify, but its current series Work Talk is interesting rather than instructive. Ferdinand Dennis interviews workers born in the colonies and now living in Britain. His first three have been Norman Beaton, the actor, Clyde Williams, head of FullEmploy Training, and Margaret Busby, the publisher. All these are from the West Indies, like Dennis himself, and all reasonably successful The point made, as I see it, is that colonials, if that word may be used, show special interest in the work of other colonials, a prejudice some might call loyal and others racist. The Unfair Sex (Radio 4, four consecutive Sundays) is for feminism, for the unfair sex is, of course, the male. This week we had misogynist quotations from Fidelis Morgan's The Misogynist's Source-Book. Beginning with the account of Eve's creation from Genesis, we ran through Roget, Percy's Reliquiae Antiquae, pop songs, Ovid, Beerbohm, Dali, Ecclesiastes and Proverbs, to end with Boucicault's remark summing the theme up neatly, 'I wish Adam had died with all his ribs in his body.' Entertainment more than service, but good listening, agree with it or not. Later the same evening The Deserted Child showed how misogyny might be prompted. Queen Victoria's treatment of her third son, Prince Arthur, was unspeakable. Her own childhood was bound to have given her some unusual notions. Perhaps she wanted to make sure that Prince Arthur was not like the Prince of Wales. After the death of Prince Albert ('father, protector, guide') the Queen appointed Major Howard Elphinstone as the Prince's 'governor', and he remained in that post even after the Prince had been to Woolwich and granted an Army commissioned. But the Queen wrote endless personal notes. Be reserved in Society, but affectionate with servants. Never speak harshly to Highlanders. Do not copy Bertie's way of sitting with arms on the table. Do not read too much scripture on Sundays. Polo is 'really cruel', hunting overdone. The unfortunate Elphinstone was ultimately promoted lieutenant-colonel and knighted. The Prince became a field-marshal and Duke of Connaught, and married a German princess. The Queen's expertise at arranging marriages will be dealt with in next week's programme. We may also learn the point of the title. A word on Radio 3's Two's Company on Fridays. Charles Melville considers jazz players who liked playing together, and could hardly begin with anyone but Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang (Wildcat, he gave us). But some of the other duos - Armstrong and Hines, for instance - seem to me no more than happy studio meetings. In that category, we might extend to such joys as Tram, Bix and Eddie.

text:  JOHN DRUMMOND, controller of BBC Radio 3, could sell music to the Sirens and his launch of the Proms programme is always a tour de force. You had somehow forgotten your longing to hear the USSR Ministry of Culture Chamber Choir sing Rakhmaninov's Vespers in Russian until Drummond tells you he has dreamed of the moment since childhood. As the man with the biggest budget - Pounds 40m - in British music, Drummond can bag the names, and this year's Proms offering of 67 concerts in 58 days has the usual plums - the first Prom visit by the Berlin Philharmonic, the European premier of Tippett's Byzantium, the English revival after 65 years of Dvorak's The Spectre's Bride. There are also curiosities, notably 89 year harpist Sidonie Goossens, the only survivor of Adrian Boult's original BBC Symphony Orchestra of 1930, playing 'The Last Rose of Summer' on the Last Night. For a Pounds 95 season ticket you can hear everything as a Promenader. Over half the 200 works on offer will have been composed this century and there are five new commissions. There should have been six but once again Malcolm Williamson, Master of the Queen's Music, has failed to deliver. This time he has actually written the piece, but he now sees it as part of a larger work and neither composer, soloist James Galway, nor Drummond think it should be performed out of context. The Gulf War was not an unqualified success - it messed up the Acceptance-in-Lieu scheme under which tax can be paid in works of art rather than hard cash. The Treasury has always hated the idea: it raises the spectre of the American practice where the rich can pay off their tax bills by giving pictures, etc, to museums (sometimes at fanciful valuations), and the Revenue has managed to keep the money it 'lost' to AIL to a theoretical Pounds 12m a year. But in the financial year just ended only Pounds 1.25m was written off against tax compared with Pounds 11.5m in 1989-90. The Treasury's excuse is that the exceptional and unknown costs of the Gulf War forced it to freeze all special provisions, including Acceptance-in-Lieu. So the major deal planned last December, a Sevres service and an 18th century French wardrobe sold to pay off another Pounds 2m of the tax due on the Pounds 90m estate of the late Dolly Rothschild, was suspended until April and will be in the 1991-92 figures. It is surprising that more use is not made of AIL, especially now that prices for British works of art have collapsed at auction. During the 1980s it was easy for Sotheby's and Christie's to convince executors and heirs that rich foreigners would pay a higher price in the saleroom than the Treasury, or any British museum, could muster through AIL or private treaty sale. Even when it turned out that the Chester Beatty estate got a smaller return, after tax, by selling Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' for Pounds 24.2m at Christie's than it would have received from a museum deal at less than half that price; even when major pictures last year, like Constable's 'The Lock' or Benjamin West's 'General Monckton', either failed to meet their estimate at auction or to find a buyer at all, the excitement of a public sale seemed to mesmerise vendors. Apart from auction room hype the other main reason why the AIL provisions are not more widely used is that with a top tax rate of just 40 per cent and schemes to protect inheritances from the Inland Revenue, the very rich are so much richer these days. There is less need for them to sell. But greed will sometimes out and the queue of national treasures waiting in the warehouse for export shows no signs of lessening. The campaign by the Fitzwilliam at Cambridge to keep the Badminton cabinet seems a sadly lost cause. But Nick Serota at the Tate might still find a rich friend to cough up the Pounds 10m needed to save 'The Lock', to grace his forthcoming Constable show, and if York launches an appeal to raise Pounds 2m to retain the Middleham Jewel the National Heritage Fund will rally round with some cash. 'The Three Graces' is in total limbo. The export stop still holds but the owner, widely believed to be a Trust controlled by the Tavistock family, is insisting, without success, that the putative buyers, the Barclay twins, pay the interest it has lost on the Pounds 8m sculpture while the attempts to save it have meandered on. With museum purchasing grants frozen for the last six years the NHF, with its annual grant of Pounds 12m, has become the last chance for diverting works of art away from the docks and into the safety of national institutions. But as Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, pointed out this week, the reliance on the NHF is starting to create a one sided view of art. The Fund, quite rightly, only aims to safeguard British treasures, or foreign masterpieces which have traditionally been admired by British collectors. If extra purchasing money was given directly to museums and galleries the National Gallery and the Tate would be spending it on acquiring foreign works, like 19th century Italian and German art, and 20th century Russian. By channelling all the safeguarding money into a heritage fund a traditionalist and insular tradition is maintained and the wider currents of world art lost to sight. A couple of Thatcherite councillors in Ealing are going to wreck the cultural heritage of the capital. That is the not totally fanciful story being pedalled by the administrators of a hundred London arts organisations who see the Pounds 3m a year they get from the London Boroughs Grants Scheme reduced to, at the best, Pounds 2m, at the worst nothing, because of the spoiling tactics of the Tories. The sums may be tiny, less than Pounds 5,000 in some cases, but the failure of the 1991-92 cheques to arrive has already forced over 50 job losses. Even the bigger organisations are affected. The King's Head has cancelled all in-house productions and the Bush is cutting 40 per cent of its planned productions. Hampstead will go dark for two months in 1992. Eight organisations, mainly ethnic dance and theatre companies, face immediate closure. The best move for the arts companies is not to pretend that London will come to a halt without them but to make the financial case for survival. This is the approach of the King's Head which points out that 41 per cent of the shows in the West End, a magnet for the Pounds 2b spent annually on arts related tourism in the UK, originated from the subsidised sector, and that the Government received ten times as much from VAT on King's Head productions, and transfers, than it indirectly gives in its LBGS grant of Pounds 34,000.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / As they say in Europe: A curious insularity 
text:  'THE PRESIDENT took us out on the terrace overlooking the south lawn and told us that we really had to promote growth in our own economies.' In Washington last Sunday this story was told by the Italian finance minister to the correspondent of Il Sole 14 Ore, among others. But Guido Carli is 75 and the incident he related took place in 1962 - the President was John F. Kennedy. The same thing happened when the Group of Seven finance ministers met in Washington last Sunday; this time it was President Bush who told the assembled ministers and central bank governors that they ought to be cutting interest rates - to promote economic recovery. So for Guido Carli little had changed. He takes a long view because he is the one man still around at this level who was actually at Bretton Woods in 1945 for the famous conference that established the post-war international monetary system. Others, however, go back little further than the Gulf War. It was Klaus Engelen in Handelsblatt of Frankfurt who observed: 'America can't lead everything,' adding 'after the Gulf War, the interest rate war. The question is now whether we go back to the experience of the crash of 1987.' That was when interest rates got out of line and there was a crisis of confidence in international co-operation. So, asked Dr Engelen, did Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, want to get another bloody nose from the Bundesbank? 'The whole interest rate campaign came after Washington realised that the Gulf War would not lift business activity . . . But a sober expression of this meeting is that leadership in war doesn't mean that on the battle fields of interest rates and inflation, America can lead the world as well.' Fortunately, Germany had found a sound ally in fighting against American monetary excesses. Norman Lamont, UK Chancellor, had come to the support of 'the embattled finance minister, Theo Waigel', Engelen said So Lamont is the second in the line of British ministers who have become minor stars in the German firmament - Chris Patten on the liberal left, Norman Lamont among the Bavarian conservatives. But Waigel relies heavily on the votes of highly of subsidised farmers for his political strength. Lamont spent a long time at the various IMF finance ministers' meetings lecturing his audience on the iniquities of the Community's Common Agricultural Policy. It may have been the support of Britain that led Roel Janssen in NRC-Handelsblad of Rotterdam to remark: 'The Germans stole the show - they got out of it morally strengthened.' For the French there was more than just a Euro-American row at stake. There was also clear evidence that France was caught out because it had very little to say on the row in question. And it could hardly in its present circumstances side with the Germanic and Tory puritans. Nor could it support the the US against its partners. So the only solution was to make it clear that everybody else was making a bit of a mess of things. Le Quotidien de Paris headlined its story: 'Germany Imposes Unemployment.' In La Tribune, Isabelle Croizard and Dominique Thiebaut asked whether in view of the discord, the Group of Seven had not become the Group of Nought. The outcome of all the arguing about interest rates was that the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate by half a percentage point. The IMF's powerful Interim Committee had just stated that nobody should do that unless inflation and budget deficits were under control, which they are not in the US. But there was no word of criticism from anyone. They were all too glad to see the dollar fall. The meetings at the IMF which normally take place here twice a year reflect a curious fact about the US. I have quoted only a tiny part of the wealth of comment that appeared in the European press about the doings of the finance ministers. In the American press, there is little or nothing. The Washington Post has a bit about all these things, and the New York Times devotes some of its business section to these matters. But in, say, the Baltimore Sun, published a mere 45 miles away, there is less about vital matters of international finance than in the provincial Swiss press, and it is harder to get more provincial than that. So I have a proposal. Largely for the sake of the thousands of foreign reporters who flock here at such times, Washington should be moved east. Not physically, but by time zone. Harrassed Europeans anxiously watch deadlines pass as they miss their last editions at home because the news arrives too late in Washington. Bored Americans take no notice when the news does arrive. The peculiar thing is that in Europe the local news is enhanced if lots of foreign dignitaries are present. In the US any foreign presence reduces the importance of the story. Thus the only speeches Ronald Reagan made that did not appear live on that ultimate arbiter of news, CNN, were those before the annual World Bank-IMF meeting here. Yet there is perhaps another side to this insularity. Let me start by saying I have not looked at comparative coverage of the disasters that have afflicted the Kurds, largely because the views on their peculiar tragedy have been unusually uniform. Everybody has said more or less the same thing. But I saw that the widely syndicated American columnist, Leslie H. Gelb, was able to seize on this uniform and wide coverage to make a uniquely American domestic political point. 'Our movers and shakers - in the Federal Government and the media - know and care more about foreign than domestic affairs.' He added: 'America's elites can rattle off the names of the top three Kurdish leaders and skip into intricate arguments about what can be done to re-establish Iraq as the garden of Eden. But ask them about what's involved in Medicaid or Federal aid to education, and most will return a guilty smile - and guide the conversation back to Gorbachev or the Kurds.'

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Sport: The heroes and villains are back - America's cup 
text:  or possibly a kind of yachting purgatory - the America's Cup starts a new life. The Blue Peter is now flying for first-ever regatta in the new 80-foot Cup class in San Diego, California - an world championship that is the preamble to the main contest, which begins there next January. All the heroes and villains are back in town - plus a few new ones. Damon Runyon would have loved the America's Cup. Smooth Kiwi financier Michael Fay has entered one of his three yachts while another is on charter to the somewhat disorganised Spanish team. Dennis Conner is a San Diegan and will sail his new boat, Stars &amp; Stripes, for the first time. Already a few visitors are learning that you do not play poker with The Man in his own kitchen. Much attention will focus on the Italian team led and bankrolled by industrialist Raul Gardini. Gardini has entered two boats in the regatta and has told his skipper, Paul Cayard, an American who found it worthwhile to live in Europe, that with Dollars 40m available to the programme, some silverware on the table would be appreciated. However, around the sailors' bars the word is that the Italians are going backwards. The more money they spend on design and personnel, the slower the boats get. This is a well-recognised Cup phenomenon which in 1986 stopped the extraordinarily well-funded New York Yacht Club equipe from even making the challenger semi-finals. No team will be subjected to such close domestic scrutiny as the Japanese two-boat effort. The America's Cup has become a virtual crusade in the Ginza, inspiring everything from leisure clothes to nightclubs. Chris Dickson, the Kiwi skipper in 1986-87, has been paid a reputed Dollars 900,000 to drive the Japanese No 1 yacht and has even learned Japanese. Intent on a place on a more than merely financial world stage, Japan seems set on irritating the Americans, current and near-perpetual holders of the Auld Mug. 'We have Columbia Pictures. We have Rockefeller Centre . . . Why not the America's Cup?' asked Kaoru Ogimi, commodore of the Nippon Ocean Racing Club, on a recent visit to the US. The American most determined to frustrate Ogimi's daydreams is alternative energy billionaire Bill Koch, who came into big-boat racing in 1984 with the purchase of the maxi-yacht Matador. Since then nothing Koch has done has been less than precisely calculated. When he built a new maxi, Matador 2, five years of research from 20 naval architects went into the hull design. Third-scale models - bigger than most family yachts - were sailed off Koch's compound at Cape Cod. At her first regatta Matador 2 won five out of seven races without really trying. The technical director for the Cup yacht is Dr Heiner Meldner, a nuclear physicist. Last week Koch announced that Boeing would be supporting his technical effort. 'We plan to make every bit of technology we can find in America to make our boat go fast,' he told the media. A bit of disinformation does not go amiss, either. The public were told that the first yacht was under construction at a locked shed at the Goetz yard in Rhode Island. Goetz was, in fact, paid to keep the shed empty and secret. The real yacht was built at an aerospace facility in the Utah desert. A scan through the entry list reveals that nine boats from the US, France, Italy, Japan, Spain and New Zealand are due to line up for the regatta. The Cup has become a tussle between the dollar, the yen and (in the absence of a European currency) the deutschmark. But what of Britain? Peter de Savary will have his design team of Ian Howlett and Phil Morrison in San Diego evaluating the opposition prior to the beginning of construction of a British contender in June. 'It's hard to see a lot of strength in the fleet as it stands,' said Howlett, who designed America's Cup challengers for Britain in 1980, 1983 and 1986. 'There are going to be some very embarrassed people out there who have spent a lot of money. There's no doubt in my mind that we can produce boats that are significantly faster than anything out there at the moment.' With skipper Lawrie Smith already signed up to drive the boat and a construction team on stand-by, the de Savary team looks in reasonable shape, but must still be rated an outside chance. At the end of the current regatta, however, many of the major-league players who have already built one or two boats may be wishing they had kept their money in the bank and done a little more watching and thinking. 'A shortage of money and time can concentrate the mind wonderfully,' says Howlett pithily.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Motoring: Determined to be a ruler of the road 
text:  EIGHT YEARS ago, Mitsubishi's Shogun was the first import to loosen Range Rover's stranglehold on the posh end of the four-wheel drive, on-off road market. Range Rover, aristocratic elder statesman of recreational 4x4s, is now in its 21st year. It looks much the same as it did when launched in 1970, although there have been many changes below stairs. That is not the Japanese way of making motor cars. At five years, a Japanese car is getting long in the tooth and at eight, it is overdue for replacement. So this week, a completely new Shogun went on sale in Britain, some months after it had made its debut back home. Or rather, two Shogun estates; a short wheelbase 3-door and long wheelbase 5-door. Each comes with a choice of a 3-litre V6 petrol engine with catalyser or a 2.5 litre turbocharged and intercooled diesel. A 5-speed manual gearbox is standard, a 4-speed automatic optional on the petrol V6 versions. Only the engines, suitably uprated, have been carried over. Everything else, from the curvy styling to a unique transmission offering the benefits of both two-wheel and four-wheel drive, is new. Having tried all of them on and off road, I rate the new Shoguns clear class leaders for all-round performance, comfort and value for money. Prices, which include a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty, start at Pounds 17,989 for the 3-door diesel and go up to Pounds 22,349 for an automatic 5-door V6. The diesels are cheaper than their petrol- engined equivalents. If I have any reservation about the Shoguns at all, it is their styling. The original one had fairly sober, straight up and down lines that quickly gave it a Range Rover acceptability in the country, both as a puller of horse trailers and a grandstand at hunt races. The new one is a bit bulgy in a transatlantic kind of way. Not as de trop as the vast new Toyota Land-Cruiser, you understand, but perhaps not quite as Badminton as it used to be. Potential owners of on-off road four-wheel drives (especially those to be used mostly on-road) should look beyond the rotund styling and flash alloy wheels. They will find the Shogun as light to drive, as refined mechanically and almost as comfortable to ride in as a car. Yet off road, it makes light of terrain not one owner in 100 would dream of driving over. The secret of the Shogun's elegance on-road is its independent front suspension. All its class rivals, bar the Isuzu Trooper, have beam axles front and back. These are fine - arguably better - for the most severe off-road driving but they can't provide really car-like handling on road. Immediately after testing the Shogun I drove its closest competitor, the Land Rover Discovery. This admirable machine is relaxed on a motorway and almost unstoppable across y ride on winding roads disconcerting. It is less urbane (the turbo-diesel in particular) than the Shogun when used as a car substitute. Shoguns used to have a simple, selectable transmission. For normal roads, they were rear-wheel driven; for driving across country, on snow-covered roads or muddy tracks, you put them in high or low range four-wheel drive. They can still be used in rear wheel-only drive on the road. This makes them quieter and more economical because it puts out of use two sets of gears, one in the transfer box, the other in the front axle. But four-wheel drive can also be engaged or disengaged at up to 100 kmh (62 mph) and, if you wish, left permanently in use, as it is in a Range Rover, Land Rover Discovery or the latest Mercedes Benz G-Wagen. The new Shogun has a central viscous coupling. This allows four-wheel drive to be used full time on hard, dry roads without straining the transmission, making the steering feel peculiar or wearing out the tyres. It can be locked for extra off-road traction. All these functions are under the control of a single, easy-to-use lever that also selects high and low range in the transfer gearbox. For the ultimate in off-road grip, pressing a button on the fascia locks the rear differential, providing your speed is less than 10kph (7mph). I drove the Shoguns in Spain, where a dry spell ended the day I arrived  - it always does. On traditionally awful Spanish minor roads through the mountains - even the patches are patched - they went exactly where I pointed them in comfort and security. On the autovia, they cruised quietly at the sort of speeds British business drivers are accustomed to use on motorways. The impression I had - may Mitsubishi forgive me - was of driving an abnormally high-slung Volvo estate car. The engines are quiet, the transmission literally noiseless and wind noise subdued. Shoguns are equipped and have interiors furnished to executive car levels. The long wheelbase ones have a large power-operated glass sunroof over the passenger part. Even the 3-door models - now genuine 5-seaters - have electric windows, headlamp washers and rear window wash-wipe. The back door is side-hinged and stays open when the Shogun is parked on a steep slope. Among the instruments is an exterior thermometer and an inclinometer. All big, bluff four-wheel drives become thirsty when driven fast because the air cannot flow smoothly around their bodies. Still, the new Shoguns are not so bad as the originals, with drag coefficients (an indication of their wind resistance) of 0.48 compared with 0.55. Cars that cruise quite economically at 80mph (128kph) have drag coefficients of around 0.30. The official figures suggest the Shogun turbo-diesels should average about 25mpg (11.3l/100km) and the petrol V6s, whether manual or automatic, around 20mpg (13.5l/100km) when used on roads in rear-wheel drive. But if you cruise at more than 80mph (128kph) and drive them as though they were hot hatchbacks, all bets are off.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Sport: Northampton's mighty oak - Rugby 
text:  John Hopkins, the noted British sportswriter, will report regularly for the Weekend FT on golf and rugby, joining a small band of regular commentators: John Barrett (tennis), Teresa McLean (cricket), Keith Wheatley (yachting and sports politics), and Michael Thompson-Noel (horse racing). IT IS A matter of opinion whether or not Northampton is 'a dull place with much nondescript modern development,' as it is described in the Blue Guide to England. But suggest that its rugby team and its captain are dull or nondescript and you will have to answer to some of the most partisan spectators this side of Cornwall. This afternoon, coachloads of these supporters will be at Twickenham to roar on - and I mean roar on - Northampton in the Pilkington Cup final against Harlequins. When the men in black, green and gold run on to the most famous rugby pitch in the world, take a look at Gary Pearce, Northampton's captain. You can hardly miss him. His neck is as wide as most people's thighs and his thighs are as sturdy as the trunk of a tree. Wound around his head as protection for his ears will be a yard and a half of sticky tape. Pearce, who is 35, will probably be straining slightly as he leads his men out, puffing his cheeks, pointing his toes, his large hands making the ball look insignificant. He labours away at the game's pit face, the front row of the scrum, where it can be dark and gloomy. As tight-head prop he is the cornerstone of Northampton's scrum and as captain he is cornerstone of the team. He is the one who is never late on the team bus, never misses training, always gets on with the job in hand and the man always proffered as an example for younger players to model themselves on. Pearce first played for Northampton three prime ministers, three general elections and more than 13 years ago. He arrived from Aylesbury one Easter and less than a year later was playing for England. Since then he has acquired 34 more caps, the most by a prop forward, and has been on eight tours for his country. When you try to assess Pearce's assets as a rugby player you think of his strength, which is considerable, and of how good he is at doing what you might call the basic chores of his job. You won't see him frolicking in open play; his 16 3/4 stone sees to that. But his scrummaging technique is so faultless it could come straight from the pages of a rugby manual. 'Gary has very strong legs and always keeps his back straight,' says Barry Corless, Northampton's coaching coordinator. 'From this position he can drive forwards and upwards the moment the ball comes in. That is why he is so good. You see so many props with their heads down near their knees in a scrum and their backs rounded.' Northampton and their homely ground at Franklin's Gardens have been transformed since the summer's day three years ago when a cabal of seven members obtained the necessary majority at an annual general meeting to oust the existing committee and take over the club. Not everyone liked what followed. Soon the tumbrils rattled. Pockets of discontent formed and remain. But even those old members who have boycotted the club since the revolution could not deny the transformation effected by the new management. Three years ago the club was struggling near the foot of the second division. This season it finished eighth equal in the first. Last season Northampton won the national sevens and reached the semi-finals of the cup, thus drawing in more spectators. This has had such an effect that membership has trebled - one afternoon last season as much money was taken from one game as in the whole of the previous season. Northampton have set a record for ticket sales for this afternoon's final - more than Pounds 130,000. The Saints go marching in all right, taking coachloads of supporters wherever they go. Every rugby club in the county will have at least one coach full of supporters at Twickenham this afternoon, which is more than can be said of Harlequins. The size of Northampton's invading force will be considerable, even if it is smaller than Cornwall's army was in the final of the divisional championship recently. Last Saturday Northampton travelled to south-west London to play Rosslyn Park in what was the last league game of the season for both clubs. Roehampton looked at its best and spectators stood around, drinks in hand, enjoying the warmth of a spring afternoon. The result was a foregone conclusion from the moment Park scored in the second minute. The final score was 48-0. It seemed a shocking result for Northampton, who were only three players below full strength, and to get some perspective on it I sought the views of two of the most distinguished members of the home club. Phil Keith-Roach, Rosslyn Park's former hooker and now coach, is as much a part of the club as the netting that stops the ball flying out of the ground and on to the Upper Richmond Road. 'Gary Pearce is so good technically there's no reason why he shouldn't go on until he's 40, provided he stays free of injuries,' said the indomitable Keith-Roach. 'I played against him in my last game for Park. I broke my neck and thought I'd better retire. Mind, I was 42 at the time.' Then I came across the massive figure of the club's president and former England international, Andy Ripley, who beamed down benignly from behind his John Lennon spectacles. I thought I would soften him up with an easy question first. 'How are you?' I asked. 'Dancing on the end of a sunbeam, thank you very much,' he replied. 'And what did you make of that performance? 'Northampton are an unusual side,' he replied. 'They haven't got many stars and they were obviously not very interested this afternoon. Next weekend one of two things could happen. They could raise their game and win. Or they could be overwhelmed and lose by a record margin. I'm not quite sure which.'

The cheerful colours and light-hearted motifs are a splendid complement to the gutsy Italian-style mood of the cooking and many diners have ended up wanting to buy the plates it all came on as well. Now they can. Tricia Guild, who is married to Richard Polo, the owner of Orso, has now produced a new range of designs for the same robust pottery. It all comes from southern Italy but the colours of the new collection are softer, prettier, less bright. The motifs are as charming as ever, ranging from cockerels and fish to fruits and vegetables. Do not try to buy a matching set - the whole point is to have a random collection which you mix and match as the mood takes you. Available at Designers Guild, 271 King's Road, London SW3. Prices range from Pounds 6 to Pounds 27. Transporting the essential chilled white wine from kitchen to pool could not be easier than with this wire basket - Pounds 10 from Habitat. Also at Habitat is a range of folding wooden chairs painted in soft washed colours, the sort that would mix in beautifully with Tricia Guild's pottery. Pounds 14.75 each. Foot-high sturdy hurricane lamp - use traditional church candles but if you want the midges kept at bay make sure you buy an insect repellent candle.

text:  FOR THOSE who think that gardeners are prone to wallowing in nostalgia for the herbaceous borders of the past, The Oxford Gallery's occasional forays into the world of garden design are a useful corrective. Here is where the avant-garde of the green welly set make their stand. No romantic-style garlanded urns, no cute gnomes, no 'authentic' copies of Byronic statues, but distinctive, innovative ideas from our most contemporary of crafts people. The Oxford Gallery always has some work by contemporary artists for the garden but from time to time it mounts a large exhibition on the theme. Usually the exhibitions have been held at High Walls near Oxford - this time they are bringing their wares to London, to the Barbican Centre, where the sculpture court and a fine conservatory offer a surprisingly horticultural setting for such an urban address. If your idea of decorating your patio is to distribute a few terracotta pots tastefully around the place, then this is an exhibition to make you think. Sally Tarshish of Inscape Gardens sets the mood with some immensely erudite ideas on gardening gleaned from Chinese, medieval and classic Greek texts which she translates into a plant and sculpture garden, Five Walks. A hornbeam grove and a burbling fountain by William Pye lies in the heart of it. The work of the 50 artists and sculptors on show will ensure you never look at gardens in quite the same way again. There are Monica Young's giant-sized pots - a bit out of scale for the average city patio but splendid in a large country garden; there are ceramic kits from Jitka Palmer; stone gargoyles from Alec and Fiona Peever; or what about a carved wooden crocodile by Nick Deans? Materials used range from stone and wood to ceramic and industrial salvage. Prices for some of the special pieces seem high but many of them really are works of art. There will be many smaller, more affordable things as well - willow baskets by Alison Fitzgerald starting at Pounds 30, ceramic tableware ranging from Pounds 15, and lots more. This exhibition is far removed from the average garden centre display. Part sculpture, part decorative, part practical, anybody interested in pushing forward the art of creating gardens should not miss it. The Avant Garden exhibition opens at the Barbican Centre, Sculpture Court, Silk Street, London EC2 on May 16 and runs until June 16. It will open Mondays to Saturdays from 11am to 6pm and on Sundays from noon to 6pm. Admission to the sculpture court is free but there is a 75p charge for adults, and 50p for children, to see the conservatory. All the pieces will be for sale and similar items can be ordered from the artists. If your garden could really do with a gazebo, then Amdega have come up with the answer. A gazebo, according to the dictionary, is 'a structure whence a view may be had', and Amdega's gazebo is worthy of the finest view. Hexagonally shaped, made from Western Red Cedar wood and supported by arches and decorative trellis, it is really a summer house with open sides through which you can admire said view. Around the trellis you can trail whatever you deem to be this year's fashionable climber. The standard design is big enough to take a table and chairs so that you can have tea and cucumber sandwiches in time-honoured style, or perhaps a sundowner, while you admire the view. It has a proper roof of cedar shingle which should protect from mild showers. At Pounds 2,120 (plus Vat) it had better be some view. Amdega is one of the oldest names in conservatories and you can order one of its free colour brochures by ringing 0800-59123. If your idea of summer is some nicely turned steaks or burgers out on the barbecue, you could look at the range of barbecues produced by Barbecue Cuisine. I prefer the old-fashioned home-built brick versions but they do lack culinary flexibility. Barbecue Cuisine has more high-tech barbecue accessories, including the Auto-kebab, a battery-operated device that gently rotates the kebabs over the gas or charcoal barbecue. The unit is 11ins by 16ins, costs Pounds 34.99 and can be fitted to most barbecues. It comes with six stainless steel 18ins skewers, battery-operated motor and recipe leaflet. Available at most garden centres. Finally, the nicest parasols I have come across - and even in this country eating out of the doors in the summer requires some kind of protection from the sun if the mayonnaise is not to curdle and the butter to melt - are Rusco's Palladio parasols. They have a simplicity of design and a grandeur of size that makes them entirely different from those flimsy, dinky brightly-coloured numbers that litter most Mediterranean beaches. They are made from double twill canvas treated against mould and damp so that they can be left outside during the summer months and though I prefer the natural colouring they also come in duck-egg blue, denim blue, burnt sienna, yellow, green, brown, red and old rose. There are several sizes: the smallest, at Pounds 175, is 2.5 metres across; while the largest is 5 metres across and costs Pounds 600. The bases, made from seasoned hard wood, range from Pounds 29 to Pounds 98. The umbrellas are all joisted up (easily, so they tell me) by a pull-up rope. They can be seen at Harrods, Heal's and The Conran Shop in London, but you can order a leaflet or the parasol itself by mail from Rusco Marketing, Little Faringdon Mill, Lechlade, Gloucestershire GL7 3QQ. Those with old curtains they wish to sell through The Curtain Exchange shops, mentioned last week, might like to note that they will get 60 per cent of the sale price and the shop keeps 40 per cent.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Cookery: The first whiff of summer salad days 
text:  THE FIRST glimmers of summer produce have already appeared in the shops, but I rate these imports as pale (and expensive) imitators of the real thing. So I am happy to wait a few weeks until our own aspagarus and strawberry seasons get into full swing. Do not mistake this for an outburst of nationalistic fervour. It is a matter of the taste. Flavour and freshness are what count if you want to eat well, not show-off size and early arrival on the scene. Modest little heart-shaped scarlet strawberries grown in English fields are much more desirable than vulgar gobstopper giants from California - and tiny fragile fraises du bois grown at the feet of other plants in your own garden are the sweetest and most fragrant of all. The sappy deliciousness of asparagus is remarkably fleeting. When the stalks are truly fresh they release a lilylike scent as you scrape them for cooking. Delays render them dull and lacklustre. This is no veg to subject to jet-lag. The first of May and the start of the bank holiday season herald the awakening of summer. The urge to get out and about begins to stir in us all. Picnic hampers are brought out of hiding. Expeditions are planned. Cooks vote for shorter kitchen hours, and dishes that are quick and easy to prepare appeal more than ever. Salads would seem an obvious solution but it is too soon, too cool yet for appetites to fade and feel faint with heat. A flimsy little something light and leafy is not enough. What this hungry early summer season calls for is salads full of gutsy flavours, generously laced with ingredients you can really get your teeth into. Here are two suggestions. Both will make a substantial main course for lunch (the second is also suitable for carrying on picnics) and both can be served as a first course for a dinner party if you prefer. I am reluctant to tell you that the first one is a salad set in jelly lest you think in terms of one of those dreadful nouvelle cuisine vegetable dishes - mostly jelly, usually insipid, with the occasional art-directed bean and baby carrot, usually semi-raw, embedded in it. Such 'hunt the vegetable' dishes may have been thought up to satisfy the aesthete's eye but they do little for healthy appetites. This is a very different affair, essentially a sort of Salade Nicoise presented in an alternative guise, the ingredients simply packed into a mould and held together by pouring a little savoury jelly around them. No designer skills, no effort required - the results look impressive because the ingredients are handsome. For a final flamboyant fling, the salad can be garnished after unmoulding if you like with a blaze of brilliant colour and flavour in the form of peppery nasturtium leaves and a few of their rich red and tawny gold flowers. The second salad is one I was treated to by a great friend at a recent lunch party. Salads of spinach, bacon and quails' eggs are known and loved, as are those of duck or chicken livers with frizzy endive. She took the idea a clever step further to produce a salad chocabloc with goodies, more solids than leaves, a wonderfully felicitous melange of flavours and textures and a rich mosaic of colours. As she says, part of the charm of the dish lies in the fact that it need never be quite the same twice. There is no absolute ingredients list, no fixed weights and measures to follow. The idea is to use whatever is currently freshest and best in the market place and to your particular liking. The ingredients and quantities listed below record my choice when making the salad last weekend. They give you the spirit of the thing - an approximate ratio of leaves to meats and other goodies and the sort of dressing to consider using - to serve as a springboard for your own variations on the theme. TUNA SALAD EN TERRINE (serves 6 for lunch, more as a first course) 1 x 7 oz can of tuna fish, drained and broken into chunks; 1 x 2 oz can of anchovy fillets, drained and rolled up into spirals; 10 oz French beans, topped, tailed and steamed; 2 hard-boiled eggs, each cut into 6 wedges; 1 red pepper, grilled, skinned and cut into strips; 4 oz small cherry tomatoes; 2 heaped tablespoons capers; 14 black olives, stoned; 2 oranges; the leaves of a small bunch of basil, torn in half if large; 2 packets of aspic. Grate the zest of one orange, put it into a measuring jug with the aspic powder and pour on 1 pt boiling water. Stir to dissolve and leave to cool slightly. Squeeze the juice from both oranges. Stir this into the liquid aspic and top up with cold water to make a scant 1 3/4 pt liquid in total. Arrange some of the ingredients over the base of a 3-3 1/2 pt ring mould, bread tin or terrine, enough to quarter-fill the mould. Pour on just enough cooled aspic to 'bind' the solids and bed them down. Refrigerate for a few minutes until semi-set. Pack more ingredients into the mould, enough to half-fill it at least, cover with aspic and refrigerate as before. Repeat a third and maybe a fourth time until all the solid ingredients are used up and the mould is full. I make no attempt to arrange the ingredients in a formal pattern with layers of this, a criss cross of beans or whatever. The colours, shapes and textures of the foods are appetising enough to look lovely however haphazardly you pack them in. The only conscious effort I make is to juxtapose the blander ingredients, like eggs and beans, with the more piquant ones so that when unmoulded for serving every slice will include its fair share of savoury bite. Cover the filled mould and chill until the aspic has set to a firm jelly. Remove from the fridge half an hour or so before serving. Loosen the salad by dipping the base of the tin briefly in warm water. Dry it, run a knife around the inside edge of the tin to release the salad and unmould it onto a serving plate. A bowl of garlicky mayonnaise goes well with this. For lunch I sometimes partner the dish with a potato salad scattered with plenty of spring onions, rocket, slivers of fennel and nasturtium or marigold petals. SERIOUSLY RICH SALAD (serves 6 for lunch, more as a first course)  1/2 lb streaky bacon rashers;  1/2 lb chicken livers; 1 dozen quails' eggs; 1 avocado pear; 1 red pepper; 1 small bulb of Florentine fennel; 4 oranges; 1 1/2 dozen cherry tomatoes; 1 1/2 dozen radishes; 1 bunch of spring onions; a handful of raisins; 2 heaped tablespoons each toasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds; 1 bunch watercress; 2 handfuls frizzy endive. Grill the bacon until very crisp and cut into snippets. Clean the chicken livers, cut into smallish pieces and saute until brown on the outside but still tender and pink within. Hard-boil the eggs and shell them; leave whole or cut in half. Dice the flesh of the avocado, pepper and fennel. Remove all peel and pith from the oranges and cut the flesh into segments. Slice the radishes thinly. Chop the spring onions, watercress and frizzy endive. Put the last four mentioned ingredients into a salad bowl or serving dish and dress them generously with a pungent garlicky and mustardy vinaigrette. Add all the other ingredients and toss again. Serve with good breads, home made or something like Marks &amp; Spencer's walnut bread, warm and crusty from the oven.

text:  THE CAVIAR business has been in a black mood recently. With prices about to be quoted on the imported spring catch in the Caspian, the usual price war is going on to dump old stock before the new 'crop' arrives in the warehouses. While caviar importers undercut one another, Taste magazine has contributed to the turmoil by publishing the results of a Beluga tasting held at Christmas. It concluded that Sainsbury's pasteurised Beluga was better than all but one of the tested caviars. With no wish to pour scorn on Sainsbury's, pasteurisation for caviar is possibly even more lethal than it is for wine or cheese; it hardens the eggs, destroys the flavour and renders the caviar inert. It was not the high praise given to Sainsbury's however, which caused most grief in the Taste tasting, but the accusation that one of the caviar companies had not been selling Beluga at all, but rather cheaper Oscietre eggs. On April 22 the company in question, La Princesse d'Isenbourg, invited customers and members of the press to try their caviars and prove that there was no truth in the allegations. In the presence of Princesse d'Isenbourg (actually a German-Russian Furstin von Ysenburg from Hessen) we all gleefully tucked into some very good Beluga and Oscietre and thanked God for the internal squabbles of the caviar trade. Accusations of this sort are not new. Several importing houses have been locked in a feud over markets for some time and tempers have frayed as the markets narrow with recession. Nor is it unheard of for importers to cheat customers by packing Beluga pots with Oscietre, but those with established reputations, such as W. G. White, Grivan, Caviar Kaspia, R. E. Campbell, Caviar House and the calumnied Princesse d'Isenbourg have no interest in trying to pass off lower-priced Oscietre as Beluga and perhaps wipe out their customer base overnight. Not all the caviar on the market, however, comes from them. About 20 per cent of the eggs in restaurants come from bootleggers selling second-rate eggs packaged for the domestic Russian or Iranian markets. Restaurateurs would be wise to give bootlegged caviar a wide berth as they risk the health of their customers by serving a food which has been stored in unhygenic conditions. Nicky Kerman of Scotts in Mayfair and Overtons, the fish restaurants, says Polish sailors have become an occupational hazard for him. He says that by the law of averages an occasional tin may contain decent caviar but he buys all his supply from reputable importers. Gavin Rankin of importers Caviar Kaspia stressed the simplicity of caviar. There are three fish: Beluga, Oscietre and Sevruga of which the Beluga accounts for less than 2 per cent of the catch. They are the same fish whether caught by the Russians or the Iranians. Russian Beluga tends to be a little better than Iranian and Iranian Oscietre better than Russian. Opinions vary on the small slate grey Sevruga. Beluga occasionally comes marked 000, meaning a super-sized egg, and traditionally companies have labelled this 'royal' or 'imperial' Beluga. Oscietre is either toast/gold or dark grey/black. 'If you want a failsafe method to ensure that it really is Beluga caviar that you've bought and not Oscietre,' Rankin told me, 'all you have to do is this.' He took three grains of Oscietre caviar in a teaspoon and crushed them into his plate; the juice was golden yellow. Then taking the same number of Beluga eggs he crushed those too leaving a smear of dark grey oil on the plate: 'It works every time.'

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Food: An eye for history - Nicholas Lander recommends a favourite London hotel 
text:  SINCE I began writing this column I have been unable to recommend one of my favourite London hotels, Hazlitt's. It has a lot to offer - West End location, comfort and very reasonable prices (Pounds 86 per night for a double room) - but no restaurant. However, in January 1990 Hazlitt's proprietors, Douglas Blain and Peter McKay, doubled the size of their empire with the acquisition of the Gore Hotel, SW7, and in September 1990 became landlords of Bistrot 190, now a highly successful restaurant, on the ground floor of the Gore. This is a story of how with business sense and flair you can fall into two hazardous businesses - the hotel and restaurant trades - and land on your feet. Blain and McKay met in 1977 on the committee of the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust rescuing derelict Georgian buildings. Enthusiasts for aged buildings (Hazlitt's was built in 1716, the Gore in the 1850s) they began by buying two houses built in 1725 from British Land for Pounds 2,000, renovating them and then selling them for Pounds 90,000 - a percentage profit they have never repeated] In 1986 they heard that three adjacent buildings in Soho which had been nurses' homes for the Women's Hospital next door were coming up for auction. Checking in the Survey of London (an architectural survey of all the buildings in central London dating back to 1800) Blain discovered that underneath the awful paint was the original wooden panelling; this gave them the confidence to lodge the winning bid and look around for finance. Their dream of a small, comfortable and intimate hotel was initially greeted with disdain: surveyors told them to pull the buildings down, the local authority immediately assumed it was a cover for a brothel. Their persistence, helped by a supportive bank manager, won through and the first part of the hotel opened in September 1986. Hazlitt's opened with six bedrooms, just two bathrooms and a room rate of only 30. But guests, it seemed, particularly Americans, wanted creature comforts as well. The rest of Hazlitt's rooms were immediately brought up to expectations and business flourished. McKay, with some time in the film world, sees an hotel interior as a film set and has delighted in filling Hazlitt's, and now the Gore, with pictures, prints and antiques. Simple, old and mellow were the criteria for the design, the only plastic to be allowed in the rooms being that of the telephone and the TV. They also decided that, surrounded by Soho's restaurants, Hazlitt's would offer only a continental breakfast; no bar, room or restaurant service. The hotel would offer instead the kind of personal service they would expect when travelling themselves and, with a predominantly female staff, they now boast 60 per cent repeat business. As they appreciated the limitations imposed by the lack of a hotel restaurant, Blain and McKay pinpointed four areas of London in which they felt they could repeat Hazlitt's success. They saw the attractions of West London - with publishers and advertisers moving there - and the lure of the Albert Hall. In November 1989 an agent introduced them to the owner of the Gore and by January 16 1990 it was theirs, another suitable canvas for McKay. He discovered a wooden staircase not even on the plans and plenty of idiosyncratic design. On the first floor, where the 1950's the Elizabethan Rooms dining club had prospered in the 1950s, a lovely minstrel's gallery still survives (ask for room 101). But there was considerable work to be done. Fifty-four new bathrooms had to be installed, the staff organised and the restaurant, smelling of stale scampi and chips, was closed immediately. Although attracted to the restaurant business the partners were aware of its pitfalls. They had, however, unwittingly, become landlords of a restaurant, as the Gore's basement had been sub-leased to a consortium establishing the BES-funded restaurant and club, 190 Queensgate. A year ago Blain and McKay approached the head of the consortium, Roy Ackerman, and its chef, Anthony Worrall-Thompson to see if they would be interested in running the hotel's restaurant and room service. They were and the ensuing arrangement has brought the best out of both sides. Blain and McKay provided the hardware, the fixtures and fittings and, most importantly, the hotel computer which has helped to monitor costs (often a chef's blindspot). Worrall-Thompson has been left to concentrate on the cooking. And, as proprietors and landlords, they retain ultimate control. Worrall-Thompson's original menu was rejected because Blain and McKay felt it was too pretentious and expensive. Worrall-Thompson came back with others which have pleased customers and landlords alike and the Bistrot has served more than 25,000 meals since it opened last September. The room and the menu suit each other well. Large windows on two sides let in natural light and McKay's policy has been pursued with the interior - paint it cream and cover it with pictures (there are 4,500 in the hotel). The food, with its emphasis on the Mediterranean, is varied, healthy and of generous proportions: pumpkin and pepper soup, garlic terrine, bruschetta with plum tomatoes, chicory tarte tatin, lamb shank with flageolet beans and rosemary polenta are just some of the temptations. Prices follow the owners' principle of being slightly below the market - the average spend at lunch is Pounds 17 per person, at dinner Pounds 20. As the Gore prospers Blain and McKay are looking to expand. Hazlitt's, 6, Frith Street, London W1, tel 071-434-1771; fax 071-439 - 1524.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Wine: Drinking by numbers - How a grasp of figures can help you choose wine 
text:  BRITISH connoisseurs tend to be wary of mixing numbers and wine. Unlike so many of our slavish American counterparts, we rather disapprove of buying something as subjective as wine on the basis of scores out of 100 allotted by other palates, however glorified. There is one way however that a keen grasp of numbers can steer consumers towards wine quality. It has nothing to do with maths but quite a lot to do with geography, the geography of France in particular. With characteristic logic, the French number their equivalent of counties, departements, alphabetically. Thus, the first two digits of a French postcode or the last two digits of a car numberplate, exactly pinpoint a specific area of the blessed hexagone. A keen student of licence plates such as myself delights in spotting a driver from Ain by his 01, or one from Aisne by his 02. Perhaps more usefully, knowledge of a few key departement numbers can greatly help the interpretation of wine labels - particularly those on the legion of increasingly impressive bottlings from France's less famous wine regions - Vin de Pays des Coteaux des Collines Inconnues and the like. This struck me forcibly as I was trying a line-up of new Chardonnays the other day. I began with a sad, feeble little thing called Domaine de Collin Rozier (about Pounds 3.50 in Tesco). Like so many cheap wines carrying the name of today's most fashionable grape variety, it was a Chardonnay in name only and bore no tasteable relationship to the cool steeliness of Chablis, the concentration of great white burgundy or the lush Chardonnays of California, Australia and New Zealand. It was simply a neutral, dry white wine with more or less the same characteristics as an ordinary white vin de table. It was labelled as a Vin de Pays d'Oc, a country wine from the Languedoc in southern France, and according to the back label came from 'the largest mature Chardonnay vineyard in the south of France.' Maybe they planted a less-than-brilliant clone, maybe the vines were encouraged to be too productive to be capable of producing a wine of much character, but it was a number on the label that gave me the major clue to the wine's mass-produced character. 'Bottled by G Badriou,' it said (so far, so good), followed by '69220'. Aha] The telltale 69 is the call sign of the Rhone departement which includes Lyons and much of Beaujolais with its many near-industrial wine bottlers. G Badriou may sound like a charming one-man band, but I bet it is one of many names used by a pretty big bottling plant that ships in wine by tanker from all over France. In my experience, the further from the vineyard a wine is bottled, the more character and integrity is sacrificed. The numbers of the departements that are actually in the Languedoc, as opposed to hundreds of miles up the motorway, are from east to west 30 for Gard, 34 for the sprawling Herault, 11 for Aude and Roussillon, south towards the Spanish border, is 66 for Pyrenees Orientales (where Oddbins have found a really characterful peachy, lightly oaked Cotes du Roussillon Blanc 1988 from the Rivesaltes co-operative, at 66600, for just Pounds 4.49, a good price for so much culinary useful power and balance). The next Chardonnay I tried was at the very opposite end of the character spectrum and proudly bore the code 34530 showing it was indeed raised and bottled in the Herault departement of the Languedoc, at the Domaine St Martin de la Garrigue, a Vin de Pays des Coteaux de Bessilles, if that leaves you any wiser. I tasted the 1989 vintage which is now sold out and is being replaced by a 1990 that is presumably even more powerful and which Adnams of Southwold should be selling at Pounds 5.95 from next month or so. Adnams' wine buyer Simon Loftus is famously keen on wines with character and this one oozed it. At 13.2 per cent alcohol it was about as potent as a Montrachet and almost as ambitious. With aromas of butterscotch restrained by hints of green fruit, this wild wine left me impressed but wondering rigid quality control parameters of, say, Marks &amp; Spencer. It is probably their loss although I suspect that St Martin's owner Monsieur Henry, who describes himself on the label as a 'vigneron-eleveur', was better at the first, outdoor half of the job in 1989. The property is certainly one to watch. The third Chardonnay was my favourite of the line-up and came from an even more obscure departement in wine terms. Domaine de Ribonnet 1989 (Pounds 5.99 Oddbins) is from 31 which makes it a Vin de Pays de la Haute Garonne produced south of Toulouse in what is almost terra incognita of the vine. Made by the ambitious winemaker of nearby Chateau Montauriol, one of Fronton's beefier representatives, this Chardonnay seems well worth its premium over the mass production Tesco model. It is made on a lavishly maintained Swiss-owned property from 12-year-old vines with yields well below Burgundian levels. It too notches up 13' of alcohol and has lovely ripe Chardonnay flavours, a little cooler and cleaner than St Martin's, and with a fair old whack of new but fairly restrained oak. It reminded me of nothing so much as one of the best cuvees of oak-matured Chardonnay from Limoux (code number 11 for Aude)  -which is perhaps not surprising since the Domaine de Ribonnet, like Limoux, is on the south-western cusp of Atlantic and Mediterranean climates. My line-up ended with two further examples of Chardonnay as she is typically wrought at the moment, a lush Australian and a wildly overpriced Burgundian. Oases of real quality and value are undoubtedly to be found in the French regions at the moment, but you may need a map, a good memory and the list below to identify them from the label. Be wary of wines whose bottlers' codes begin with 76 for Rouen or 75, 78 or 91 for Greater Paris. These will have been shipped north in bulk and may well have shed some of their character and guts en route.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            MAJOR FRENCH WINE PRODUCING DEPARTEMENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wine region                   Departement           Code  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Champagne                     Marne                   51 Alsace                        Haut-Rhin               68                               Bas-Rhin                67 Burgundy Chablis                       Yonne                   89 Heartland                     Cote d'Or               21 Cote Chalonnaise              Saone-et-Loire          71 Maconnais Beaujolais                    Rhone                   69 Rhone/Provence North                         Drome                   26 South and W Provence          Bouches-du-Rhone        13 E Provence                    Var                     83 Languedoc-Roussillon Languedoc                     Gard                    30                               Herault                 34                               Aude                    11 Roussillon                    Pyrenees-Orientales     66 Bordeaux                      Gironde                 33 Loire Muscadet                      Loire-Atlantique        44 Anjou-Saumur                  Maine-et-Loire          49 Touraine                      Indres-et-Loire         37                               Loir-et-Cher            41 Sancerre                      Cher                    18 Pouilly-Fume                  Nievre                  58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

text:  I UNDERSTAND that the abandonment of a traded option is treated for CGT as a disposal at nil value, so that the indexed cost becomes an allowable loss. Can you tell me whether this treatment also applies to bond warrants dealt in on the London Stock Exchange. My inquiry relates more specifically to Phibro Salomon No 1 Warrants, which expired worthless on 13 November 1990. No allowable loss accrues on the expiry of any option to acquire or dispose of qualifying corporate bonds or designated gilt-edged securities because of section 29(2) and 67(1) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, as amended. The definition of 'qualifying corporate bonds' is to be found in section 64 of the Finance Act 1984, as amended. Subject to that exclusion, indexed allowable losses accrue on the expiry of options of the following types, by virtue of section 137(4) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979, as amended: (a) an option (including an option warrant) which at the time of expiry is quoted on a recognised stock exchange or on a recognised futures exchange; (b) an option relating to shares or securities granted by a member of a recognised stock exchange, provided that - if the member is acting as agent for a non-member - the underlying shares or securities are dealt in on a recognised stock exchange (not necessarily the exchange of which the agent grantor is a member); c) an option relating to shares or securities granted (as principal) by an authorised person or a listed institution, as defined in the Financial Services Act 1986. That list is not exhaustive, but probably covers the types of option which interest you. The list was shorter before April 29, 1988 (the day specified in the Finance (No 2) Act 1987 (Commencement) Order 1988).

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Diary of a private investor): The rights of spring / Questioning companies' motives for raising money through rights issues 
text:  I AM beginning to feel a bit left out. In the past few months, more than 50 UK public companies have announced rights issues. I have not had shares in any of them. Indeed, the last rights issue in which I participated was for Sycamore Holdings in September last year. I first bought shares in Sycamore in 1989. The company manufactured garden furniture and imported barbecues from the US. I thought that a hot summer would do wonders for its sales. It also had takeover attractions, as then the company was capitalised at less than Pounds 3.75m. I hoped someone might be interested in using it as a 'shell' for bigger things. However, I soon got bored with the company's lacklustre share price performance and reduced my holding. The company produced poor trading results, and last September announced a two-for-one rights issue at 10p per new share. I took up my rights in full because accompanying the rights issue was the statement that Bill Rhodes would be joining the board as a non-executive director and Peter Hopkins would become managing director. Both men had been directors of Williams Holdings and Thomas Robinson Group during a period when they had done much to improve the share price performance of those companies. I hoped they would do the same for Sycamore - especially as they would both be taking a large shareholding in the company. Sycamore's share price has now more than doubled from the rights issue price. It seems to me that in the current Gadarene rush to raise money by rights issues that investors ought to be asking themselves if the directors of those companies are putting their own money into the businesses, too. What is the rights issue money to be used for? If it is an attempt to help bail out the company from horrendous debts, and the existing management remains, then should the rights have much appeal? I think not. However, if the money raised is to be used for expansion purposes and the management is sound, or is to be assisted by new directors with good track records, then the rights could have some appeal. Before taking up a rights issue, I also ask myself: if the current share price was the same as the rights issue price, and the company was not having a rights issue, would I buy more shares in the company? If the answer is 'no', then I look for extra reasons (if any) why the rights issue should give the company increased investment appeal. When there is a flood of rights issues (like now), I begin to wonder if this is due to a pent-up demand for extra cash that has only just been released, or is this dash for extra cash simply that some company directors feel that, if their company does not raise extra funds now, it may soon be too late for them to do so. Are they expecting a downturn in the market - or even more difficult trading conditions - that would make it much less easy to have a rights issue later in the year, or even next year? In the past, when there has been a rush of rights issues, there has also been much more takeover activity than at present. Although takeovers have increased in recent months, it can hardly be called a boom. I find this somewhat disconcerting. For example, take a company such as Herrburger Brooks. It manufactures piano keyboards and office furniture. I bought shares in it in 1985 for 60p each, believing that it had considerable 'shell' potential. In April, its 71.1 per cent shareholder, Kimball International Inc, made a takeover offer worth 220p cash per share, valuing the whole company at Pounds 2.9m. If the market really was booming, with entrepreneurs looking to make fortunes, surely Herrburger Brooks would have attracted interest from someone months ago who could have sold the manufacturing interests of the company to Kimball, while keeping Herrburger's share listing in order to use it help expand the company into related or other activities. The lack of interest in investment trusts is also rather disappointing. Instead of yet another boring rights issue, a company seeking to raise extra funds could take over an investment trust standing at a hefty discount to its net asset value, liquidate most of the trust's shareholdings, and then utilise the cash proceeds. I bought shareholdings in a number of investment trusts earlier this year, hoping for such activity. It has not happened. Why? Because taking over a trust is not as quick as a rights issue? I also hoped that some smaller trusts, such as Gresham House and TR Technology with estimated discounts on net asset value of over 60 per cent, would find increasing appeal to investors. This, too, does not seem to have happened. Add to this the fact that the other companies in which I am a shareholder appear not to want extra cash for expansion, and it seems to confirm my view that there is considerable uncertainty among professional investors and company directors as to the future of the market and general trading conditions.

I have always assumed that if the Inland Revenue did not raise an assessment, or under-assessed an individual, one could get away with it. I bought some shares under the Business Expansion Scheme in 1986, receiving tax relief on my investment from the Inland Revenue.

Only advisers who pass examinations set by the Chartered Insurance Institute (CII) - and who agree to abide by a strict code of conduct - will be eligible for membership of SOFA. The new organisation will attempting to remedy perceived deficiencies in the financial advisory sector, identified by Dr Oonagh McDonald in her report for the Securities and Investments Board, entitled 'Training and Competence within the Financial Services Industry.' The CII has already introduced the Financial Planning Certificate (FPC) and this will be improved. Candidates will be required to pass papers in three subjects: marketing, salesmanship and investor protection; life assurance and other investments; and pensions. There will be optional papers in mortgages and personal general insurance. Those who pass the FPC will be entitled to take the Advanced Financial Planning Certificate (AFPC) entitling them to membership of SOFA. The AFPC will require candidates to sit three papers, with taxation and trusts one compulsory paper. The other two papers will be chosen from personal investment planning, corporate investment planning, business management and marketing. Once an applicant has passed the exam, he will be entitled to have the status 'Member of the Society of Financial Advisers' on his business cards and stationery. Annual membership costs Pounds 50. The hope is that by the end of this year, several thousand advisers will have passed. Clients can thus start to look out for advisers, with SOFA membership, in 1992. A professional qualification is no guarantee of excellent advice but clients will at least have a guide to which advisers have proved their competence.

text:  UNIT TRUST investors are often only interested in the prices of their holdings. The financial statements they receive every half year may simply be given a cursory glance before being thrown in the bin. But this week the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO) published a Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) on the way financial statements must be presented to unitholders. What should the unitholder look for in the accounts? Peter Jeffreys of Fund Research, the analytical group, says that while each fund is different, there are some rules of thumb. 'Looking at the portfolio' he says, 'the rule is the fewer the holdings the greater the volatility. The average is probably around 60 to 80 holdings.' However, Jeffreys has found as few as 30 holdings in one fund, and as many as 200 in another. Another clue is the percentage of the fund invested in the largest ten holdings. 'The higher the percentage invested in the top ten, the greater the volatility' says Jeffreys. The average is around 20 to 30 per cent but Jeffreys has found some funds with as little as 15 per cent in top ten and others with four or five holdings, each equivalent to 5 or 6 per cent of the portfolio. Jeffreys also advises investors to look at the balance of the portfolio to see whether it has a heavy concentration in one sector. Portfolio activity - the rate at which a manager turns over the fund - is also important. If the manager is trading frequently, that could mean that the fund's growth will be swallowed up by costs, but Jeffreys stresses that good fund managers can sometimes generate heavy turnover. To measure turnover, Jeffreys suggests that investors first discover whether the fund is expanding or contracting. For an expanding fund, divide the value of securities sold by the average size of the fund over the year. For a contracting fund, divide the value of securities bought by the average value of the fund. The extreme values, according to Jeffreys, are a low of 15 to 20 per cent and a high of 300 per cent, with an average of 40 to 60 per cent.

text:  BRITISH Petroleum is ex-pected on Thursday to announce a loss of around Pounds 50m for the first quarter compared with a profit of Pounds 344m for the comparable period on the historic cost basis. If changes in the value of oil stocks are stripped out, the accounting method favoured by the group, the company is expected to show a small increase in profits of around Pounds 35m. The first quarter's stock losses are expected to be as much as Pounds 425m, compared with Pounds 70m last year. After losing out to Otto Versand in the bidding war for Next's Grattan mail order business, Sears, the retailing conglomerate, has been left looking rather forlorn. That impression may be strengthened when the company announces its full-year results on Thursday showing pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m, a severe reversal on the Pounds 231.4m it achieved the year before. Other large companies reporting next week include Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish packaging group, on Tuesday; and on Wednesday SmithKline Beecham, the drugs maker, and Trafalgar House, the construction, shipping and hotels group. Tate and Lyle, the world's largest sweeteners group which is trying to take over Bundaberg Sugar of Australia, should report pre-tax interim profits on Wednesday of Pounds 92.5m compared with Pounds 87.5m last year.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Stock Exchange enters TV drama 
text:  THE STOCK Exchange is formally committed to wider share ownership but on occasions its actions seem to contradict its rhetoric. For example, last month it became embroiled in a row with Ceefax and Oracle, the two providers of television teletext services. More than 8m TV sets in the UK are geared to receive BBC's Ceefax and and ITV's Oracle service, both of which are free, and a considerable number are watched by small investors interested in the stock market. Hence there was widespread disappointment at the beginning of April when the quality of share price information on the two services deteriorated sharply. With no warning to the viewers who follow share price changes on Ceefax and Oracle, the frequency of price updates was cut. For some months, prices had been updated every half an hour, but suddenly they were back to being changed every hour and a half. The ideal form of share-price data reflects the ebb and flow of the market, allowing investors to make buy and sell decisions on the finest terms. A system whereby prices change every half hour falls short of this 'real-time' ideal, but at least comes close. By contrast, the investor who only sees prices at 9am, 10.30am and at midday misses out on much of the morning's market action. The two services received a flood of complaints after the change, which they passed to the Stock Exchange, together with complaints of their own. Ceefax and Oracle said that the Exchange was acting against the principle of wider share ownership. The Stock Exchange's response was that the move to half-hourly updates in January had been a temporary response to the Gulf War, during which markets were expected to be more volatile than usual. As a special concession to the millions of teletext users, the Exchange had decided to speed up the flow of information. Now that the war had ended, the Exchange had decided to revert to its old practice of updating prices every 90 minutes, it said. This argument did not carry much weight with the investors who had become used to the improved service. The Stock Exchange then put its foot in deeper when an incorrectly briefed press officer said that real-time information could be bought for just Pounds 65 a year. The officer omitted the fact that it costs Pounds 25,000 a year to obtain the flow of real-time data from the Exchange. The Pounds 65 is extra - it is the charge on each computer terminal by which the information is distributed. Screen-based real-time share information is available, but at considerably more than Pounds 65 a year. The Stock Exchange's own Market Eye service requires an up-front investment of between Pounds 870 and Pounds 1,680 for hardware, plus an annual subscription charge of Pounds 1,016. (Tel: 071-410-6888 for further details.) Pont Data charges between Pounds 200 a month for real-time information (less for a restricted service) (Tel: 071-256-6234), while BT Citiservice charges a subscription of Pounds 42 per quarter, plus a charge of 45p per minute (Tel: 0442 237000). In both cases, the investor would have to pay extra for the computer hardware, although a TV set can be updated for about Pounds 150. There are also at least four telephone-based services, which offer share price and other financial information. These are: British Telecom's Citycall (0898 121220); Financial Times's Cityline (0836 4300 01); TIC's Sharecall (0898 345 345); and Telephone Information Services' Teleshare (0898 500 500). Oracle and Ceefax's argument is that they are doing the Exchange a favour by disseminating share price information to small investors. Given the Exchange's commitment to wider share ownership, why did it downgrade the teletext service? A problem is that Oracle makes money out of its share price service by charging companies to have their prices quoted and selling advertising space while the BBC is forbidden from making money out of the service. The Exchange is perhaps frustrated that it cannot share the revenues generated by Oracle and it cannot cut a separate deal with Oracle as it is contractually bound to treat both teletext providers equally. The Exchange says that it has an obligation to those who pay for the privilege of dis-tributing real-time information. Ceefax and Oracle do pay the Exchange, but not as much as the Pont Data and Citiservice. The Exchange appears to be putting its own short-term commercial interests ahead of the principle of wider share ownership.

text:  CHANCERY, the BES sponsor which was critically damaged earlier this year when its parent bank went into administration, has been resurrected under the wing of Close Brothers, the merchant bank. The four-strong management team, and two support staff, have now joined Close Brothers Investment, a newly created subsidiary. The BES companies which the team launched over the past five years will continue to be monitored by remaining staff at Chancery, headed by John Dodwell, who founded the division. Chancery will not float any new BES companies in this tax year. Craig Reader, previously managing director at Chancery, said the team would attempt to 'do a phoenix impression' at Close Brothers. The company wants to make BES issues by the end of September, when the opportunity to carry forward tax relief from last year ends. Its particular interest will be in 'growth assured' companies, which attempt to cut the risk in BES property investments by obtaining promises from housing associations to buy back properties at a fixed price after five years. Close Brothers will also look at tax shelter investments in enterprise zone property. Reader said he also hoped to explore the buy-back concept for trading companies, rather than assured tenancy property companies, although he admitted the upper limit for investment of Pounds 750,000 in these companies was a problem. Chancery was second in the BES market before the trouble hit its liquidator, but several other sponsors successfully launched schemes with 'buy-back' arrangements towards the end of the last tax year. Its enterprise zone trust deal for a property in Docklands was sponsored instead by Greig Middleton, and raised Pounds 10.72m.

text:  THIS is the pensions framework I would like to see for the present and future generations of pensioners. 1 A high level of flat rate basic pension well above the poverty level, say three-quarters of national average earnings. This pension would be available to all persons, with married men and women not in employment receiving credit from their spouses' contributions. It would be funded on the present pay-as-you-go system with the current generation of employed and self-employed paying for the current pensions. 2 The employee or the self-employed would make his or her own arrangements to provide for any additional pension, either individually or collectively through employers or trade or professional bodies. Collective arrangements would ensure that people changing jobs are treated fairly and that the value of pensions is maintained. But otherwise, they should have flexibility in their benefit structure. Employees would fund these additional pensions themselves and not rely on future generations for the payment of earning-related pensions. As such, a state earnings-related scheme would not exist unless it could be properly funded. Above all, the government, employers and individuals must face up to the cost of providing pensions and not try to fudge the issue by deferring costs.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Twenty years of muddle over pensions - Pensions Correspondent Eric Short, who retires this week, looks at the industry he has covered for nearly two decades 
text:  WHEN I started writing on pensions nearly two decades ago the UK pensions scene was in complete turmoil. As I leave the pensions world today, it is still in a state of chaos in spite of the best endeavours over the intervening 20 years of the government, the European Community and industry practitioners. At the beginning of the 1970s, there were two worlds for pensions - those employees in occupational pension scheme who could look forward to a good pension if they stayed with their employer until retirement - and those who had to rely on totally inadequate state benefits. While everyone agrees that there should be one world in pensions, no-one can agree on how to reach it. Twenty years ago, the political vision was for a comprehensive state scheme providing earnings-related pensions - complemented by occupational schemes - and individual provision for those such as the self-employed. After three abortive attempts, the notorious State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme, known as Serps, was started in 1978. Those of us who should have known better, thought this was a pensions framework, which, with improvement, could provide the necessary stability to enable people to receive adequate pensions. That stability proved to be extremely brittle. Although the benefits provided under Serps are far from generous, the present Tory administration says they would present too large a financial burden on the working population by 2020. So in the late 1980s pensions were back in the melting pot. Sir Norman Fowler undertook his famous review, the result of which was the emasculation of Serps, the ending of compulsory membership of occupational pension schemes and the introduction of a new style personal pension which could be used to opt out of Serps. Indeed, employees not previous contracted-out of Serps were entitled to receive a 2 per cent incentive contribution, labelled a bribe by the Labour party and trade unions, if they used a personal pension to contract-out of Serps. Under the present framework, the involvement of the state in pension provision has been severely cut back and individuals have to make their own arrangements to get an adequate retirement income. The government can claim success for its changes in that about four million employees have contracted-out of Serps with personal pensions, though at a cost estimated at Pounds 6bn to the National Insurance fund  - a bonanza for life companies and their salesmen. However, this framework is extremely unstable. Elements in the Conservative Party want the government to continue its reforms by abolishing Serps. There are also whispers that state benefits should be cut even further by enabling people to opt out of the basic pension. The Labour Party is pledged to return to 1978 by restoring Serps to full benefits, ending incentive payments and making it impossible for employees in the future to use a personal pension to contract-out of Serps, though existing arrangements will continue. One can sympathise with the appeal by Alan Fishman, chairman of the Association of Consulting Actuaries, for a national pensions policy which would agree in broad outlines the level of pension to be provided and the roles of the various groups in providing that pension. However, I feel that a national pensions policy is as remote as a political consensus on how to finance local authorities. The government has two major pension difficulties to settle - equalising pension ages and resolving the question of who owns and operates company pension schemes. Last year's European Court judgment in Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange has forced company schemes to have a common retirement age and equal benefits for men and women, though there is still confusion about the phasing-in of this equalisation. Social pressures and employment policy have already influenced many schemes to bring in a common pension age and some degree of flexibility in age at which employees retire. However, although the debate on equalising pension ages in the state scheme commenced in earnest in the mid-1970s, the government has given no indication about whether and how it intends to move away from the present system of a pension age of 65 for men and 60 for women, with no facility to take the state pension before these ages. One feels that the lack of action by the government is because it does not know how to change without incurring immense logistical and financial difficulties and upsetting a many women voters. I fear that nothing will happen until the government is forced to equalise by the European Community - and the relevant third draft directive on this subject has already been several years in gestation without any sign of birth. Company pension schemes providing salary related benefits have enjoyed substantial surpluses arising from the favourable investment conditions in the 1980s and reduced membership caused by widespread redundancies. Such companies have taken contribution holidays which have caused resentment among members who did not receive a corresponding share of the surplus. The result has been a debate about who owns the surplus and the correct relationship between employer, trustee, employee and pensioner in the management of schemes. A series of High Court judgments over the past two or three years on various aspects of this difficulty have failed to produced a clear answer. Legislation appears inevitable.

text:  WHAT pointers can be given to individuals to prepare themselves for eventual retirement? First, they cannot rely on the state, whatever the sympathies of the government. They need to make their own provision to ensure an adequate income. Individuals should therefore assess the opportunities offered by private provision: either an employer's scheme, if there is one; or a personal pension. Second, assuming the employer operates a company scheme, individuals should try to compare the benefits it offers with those provided by personal pensions. A company scheme providing pay-related benefits guarantees the pension in terms of salary at or near retirement, with the employer taking the financial risks (and rewards) and meeting the expenses. Such a pension is relatively hassle-free. With a personal pension, the individual has no guarantee as to the level of pension, but has to take the risks (and reap the rewards) of investment performance, managing the pension arrangements and making adequate contributions from an early stage. The charges can be heavy, so try to discover which life company has the lowest expenses. Additional benefits such as life cover have to be paid for. Third, because of financial services regulations, it is difficult for individuals to get comprehensive advice from one source. The company pension scheme adviser cannot deal with personal pensions while the independent financial adviser, unless he is fee-based, will be reluctant to recommend a client to join the company scheme. Individuals may have to get advice from two sources and collate both sets of information before making their decision. Fourth, company pensions generally favour the stayer, married employees, older employees and those not prepared to make much effort regarding pension provision. Personal pensions favour the job mover, the younger, single employee and those who want to do their own thing. Finally, be prepared to continually review and alter the arrangements in the light of changing circumstances. Good luck.

Employers can contract their members out of Serps and provide the benefits through a company scheme. Employees not in a company scheme can contract out of Serps with a personal pension. Employees, whether in or out of Serps, can provide for further benefits with a personal pension. Company schemes usually provide higher benefits in addition to the equivalent Serps benefits. However, employees in company schemes can provide addition pension though an Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC) scheme, either through an in-house arrangement or through a free standing AVC from a life company or other provider.

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (London Markets): The empty rituals of a bygone age 
text:  EIGHTEENTH century travellers to the great sites of vanished European civilisations often found, among the shattered wreckage of once-mighty edifices, groups of superstitious peasants living a miserable subsistence life. Just like the London stock market, really. Its members, eking out a hand-to-mouth living, cannot but recall the vanished rituals of their hour of glory, the great bull market of the 1980s. One such bygone ritual, in evidence this week, comes under the general heading of the worship of strange gods; in this case, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. When the Dow rises, as it did for much of the week, the London adherents of this belief are disposed to push up the local market too. A second relic is the belief that a wave of takeover bids is about to engulf the major stocks, pushing them to 30, 50 or 100 per cent premiums over their current valuations, and funnelling a torrent of cash into institutional coffers. Thus enriched, fund managers will seek to restore their equity portfolios, bidding prices up yet again. The news, over the weekend, that the two top men at Allied-Lyons would be stepping down in the wake of the company's disastrous losses on foreign currency speculation put that company 'in play' - to use the jargon of the vanished past - as a potential takeover target. And, for a few days at least, hopes abounded of a bid not merely for Allied-Lyons but for every company in the FT-SE about which a half-decent story could be told. Allied-Lyons shares certainly benefited: the stock rose from 520p at the end of last week to close at 552p on Friday, up 32p. Separately, each of these two rituals has a strong fantasy element. Together, they form a mixture which, for a while at any rate, is capable of reawakening memories of the good old days - if not of the 1980s themselves, then at least of the Disneyland version that occurred earlier this year. The knee-jerk reaction to the Dow is not entirely irrational, of course. If the Dow is rising because US interest rates are being pushed down, then the expectation that the US economy is set for economic recovery will make the shares of UK companies with heavy dependence on the transatlantic market more attractive. But a crude unweighted index of 10 companies with particularly heavy US exposure - the drug companies, BTR, Hanson, Reuters, that sort of thing - has outperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share by little more than 1 per cent. The effect has been distorted by the exceptionally strong performance by Wellcome after its results on Thursday. Buoyed up by a 10 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to March 2, and a sharp leap in operating margins, the share price rose 63p on the day, to close at 582p. On Friday, the shares rose again, closing the week at 592p, up 76p or nearly 15 per cent. Without the Wellcome effect, the US-exposed stocks would have performed roughly in line with the market as a whole - which argues that London's reaction to the Dow's move this week has been essentially one of sympathy rather than calculation. An eighteenth-century traveller would have had no difficulty in identifying this empty ritual. The 1990s have their own rituals, of course, some of which were in evidence this week. Chairmen of underperforming companies, once lying wakeful in the early mornings for the sound of a dawn raid, must now listen nervously for the postman's tread. This week he carried what was both literally and figuratively a 'Dear John' letter for Mr John Fletcher, chairman of Budgens, the grocery chain. On Monday, the message for Mr Fletcher was that institutional shareholders, including IEP Securities, Electra and Gartmore, wanted him out. By Wednesday, Mr Fletcher was on his way, paying the price for a drop in the share price from a peak of 252p in 1987 to 45p at Tuesday's close. The stock ended the week at 40p. By Friday, the habit had spread. Tace, the engineering group, was facing a similar institutional revolt, this time led by Norwich Union. Fund managers have clearly decided that - in the absence of a posse of corporate raiders to replace underperforming managements - they will do the job themselves. Another new ritual of the 1990s is the habit of companies of announcing job reductions and rights issues simultaneously, perhaps to offset the inherently teenagerish nature of a plea for more cash ('I spent what you gave me, and now I need some more.') Whatever the reason, The trend was joined this week by T&amp;N, once better known as Turner &amp; Newall, which announced that it was cutting 2,500 jobs and asking for Pounds 119m from shareholders. Perhaps because the City remembers with affection the money it made on T&amp;N as a turnaround stock in the 1980s, or perhaps because the company is not in the construction business, the rights issue was received without too many shrieks. The shares closed the week at 163p, down 13p. Another rights issue came from Bank of Scotland. So firmly does the investment community hold to its faith that this is Britain's best-managed bank that even the revelation that it had been lending money to some all-too-feckless Sassenachs failed to dent the enthusiasm with which the request for Pounds 194m was received. By Friday, the shares were up 2p on the week, closing at 137p. After the Conservative party's poor performance in the Thursday's local elections, the market ended the week on a hesitant note, with the FT-SE closing at 2,522.7, up 51.4 since the previous Friday. Perhaps just as important as the political news, however, was the imminent ritual of the in-lieu-of-May-Day bank holiday, its origins now lost in the mists of time. How long ago that all seems] Something to do with a chap called Ozymandias, wasn't it?

headline:  FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Bottom Line): T&amp;N changes gear as motor industry suffers 
text:  T&amp;N's Pounds 119m rights issue, announced this week alongside 2,500 job cuts, epitomises the twin pressures on UK motor component companies. Their profits have been affected by falling vehicle production in almost every market except Germany, but they feel impelled to carry on investing in cost-saving machinery to stay internationally competitive, particularly against the Japanese. The first point is illustrated by some gloomy figures showing the downward slide of car sales. In the UK, the number sold fell from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 2m last year, with 1.6m to 1.7m forecast for 1991. France and Spain had first-quarter falls of more than 20 per cent, and US sales were nearly 20 per cent lower in the first two months. The urge to modernise can be easily understood in the light of a recent study for the European Commission by the Boston Consulting Group and PRS Consulting International. Called The Competitive Challenge Facing the European Automotive Components Industry, it says the Europeans lag behind the Japanese in terms of productivity, quality, speed of design and development, and product costs. Against this background, Colin Hope, chairman of T&amp;N, explained the rights issue in this way: 'In weak international market conditions, we have not generated the cash flow to continue our investment programme with moderate gearing.' The Pounds 119m proceeds will help to relieve borrowings that had risen to Pounds 248m by December, giving debt-equity gearing of 49 per cent. Although 1990 also saw a rights issue - a one-for-three to raise Pounds 127m - it was absorbed by the Dollars 190m (Pounds 111m) purchase of JP Industries, a US motor parts maker. Meanwhile the capital spending programme goes on with Pounds 89m laid out last year and more than Pounds 80m budgeted for 1991. In the last five years, T&amp;N said Pounds 327m had been spent on modernising factories, developing products and rationalisation. A further Pounds 605m, net of disposals, had gone on acquisitions. The record is held by the Pounds 278m purchase of the engineering group AE, completed in early 1987. Leaving aside the reasons Hope volunteered for this week's issue, it is also significant that the dividend payment was one of the main points of the announcement. The board said it intended to maintain the total at 10.85p this year, a figure only 1.4 times covered by 1990 earnings per share of 15.45p. Earnings could decline by 30 per cent this year. So in addition to its high spending programme, T&amp;N continues as a high yield stock: 10.3 per cent on the issue price of 140p and 8.8 per cent on yesterday's close of 163p. This is some compensation for a share price that has not regained its July 1987 peak of 319p. Since 1986, it has underperformed the market by about 50 per cent. Its earnings record is a miserable minus 9.5 per cent a year compound as the pile of shares in issue has mounted. A glance at the group's history, however, helps explain why the group has expended such effort and shows that it is in radically better shape than during the 1981-82 recession. At the start of the last decade, the then Turner and Newall was the country's largest producer of asbestos-related products. The legacy of compensation claims has taken about 1 per cent of group sales each year, with occasional extra shocks. Turner and Newall's decline culminated in taxable losses of Pounds 19.3m in 1982 and the group was close to collapse. The Bank of England helped to arrange a stay of execution and Sir Francis Tombs was installed as chairman. Apart from completing a programme of cuts that saw the UK workforce fall from 22,500 in 1979 to 10,500 in 1983, the business changed direction. The dependence on asbestos was reduced, and automotive and industrial components were built up. Pre-tax profit reached a record level of Pounds 91m in 1988 on sales which toped Pounds 1bn for the first time. But T&amp;N faltered before some of its competitors. Although operating profit continued to grow in 1989 to Pounds 123m, a bulge in the asbestos-related liabilities and high interest costs reduced the pre-tax figure to Pounds 84m. Last year profits declined 16 per cent to Pounds 70.5m. Sharp falls were registered on the continent as well as in the UK. The fall in operating profit from automotive components, from Pounds 71.3m to Pounds 44.8m, was partly offset by an improvement in engineering and industrial. The latter division overtook motor, recording Pounds 61.8m of operating profits. Those figures included the effect of Pounds 14m of redundancy costs and the latest wave of job cuts, which will reduce the worldwide workforce to less than 40,000, will cost another Pounds 7m. Hope believes that the benefits of lower costs will coincide with an upturn in demand later this year to revive pre-tax profit. However, the benefits to shareholders when the recovery comes will be held up by the extra shares in issue.

text:  YOU DO not have to be paranoid to be a financial services consumer, but it helps. Take the commissions versus fees debate, which may not cause too many arguments in your local Dog &amp; Duck, but which can rouse tempers in the life assurance industry. A small company, Campbell Financial Services, has caused a stir by offering a discount pensions service. Clients could ask the advice of a commission-charging adviser but then switch to the Campbell service for execution. They would be charged a fee of Pounds 199 but initial commission, which could be as much as Pounds 1,000 for a long-term policy, would be rebated. The service was far from perfect - Campbell planned to keep any excess commissions it earned and ethical questions were inevitably raised about the likely poaching of clients. But it was in keeping with the Thatcherite philosophy that competition, red in tooth and claw, can benefit consumers. Vengeance came on Campbell from all directions. Its phone line was jammed with obscene and threatening calls from competitors, leading to the involvement of the police. There was a demand for a boycott of the company. Then Fimbra suspended the group for lacking capital backing just over a week ago. The investigation was unconnected with the recent controversy, said the regulator. But after the bad publicity over the weekend, the company was reinstated on Monday, having sorted out its problem. Fimbra was probably only doing its job - and Campbell admits the service was its main hope of pulling itself out of an unprofitable period. But it is not necessary to believe that Campbell is entirely whiter than white to feel slightly uneasy at the way it was treated. Fees have many advantages for consumers, not the least of which is that they ensure that the adviser and the client have a commonality of interest. An adviser charging commission may be independent, but it is impossible for him to be entirely disinterested. Of course, journalists tend to be great enthusiasts for fees, an attitude which causes advisers to smile at their naivety. Out trot the counter-arguments in quick succession. The public is not prepared to pay fees This is probably because consumers do not know what they are paying. It is easy to believe, when consulting your friendly adviser, that commission comes out of some ill-defined insurance company 'pot' and not from your own pocket. This is because the system of telling you what you fork out is opaque. The regulatory body, the Securities and Investments Board, has hardly been the consumer's champion in this respect. The public will be driven into the arms of the tied agents, whose commissions are much easier to hide This argument is really a development of the first. It depends on consumers being told as little as possible about the products they buy. If advisers charge fees and recommend the policies of life companies with the lowest expenses, they should be able to demonstrate value for money compared with tied agents. As Eric Short pointed out in the last Weekend FT, life company expenses are a vital component of investment return. Again, the regulators (Lautro this time) have produced rules which tend to obfuscate rather than elucidate the issues. Why should commissions be revealed, when consumers are not told the mark-up on a washing machine? When you choose a washing machine, you know exactly what it is for - washing clothes - and it is easy to compare its price and functions with other models. A washing machine has a warranty if it goes wrong in the short term; but it could be decades before you find out whether a life assurance policy has performed well and you will then have little comeback. In any case, the function of a financial services product is to give you a return on the money you invest. The charges you pay are thus the very essence of the product's worth. Independent financial advisers will go out of business, under a fee-based system. One can see the appeal of this argument to an adviser, but not to a consumer. It is certainly worth having independent financial advice but the title IFA is a recent creation applied to people who were previously called  -perish the thought - insurance salesmen. Ten years ago, 'independent' financial advice was seen to come from accountants, solicitors and, rightly or wrongly, bank managers. Many of the last-named, now that banks are financial supermarkets, may no longer fit the name. But why cannot consumers turn to accountants for advice? It is hard to believe, with 200,000 UK accountants, that they cannot fill most of the market niches. All this is not to deny that many financial advisers are extremely professional and try hard to give their clients a good service. It is just that the system for selling financial services is flawed. It was set up to suit the life insurance companies, not the consumer. One of the most suspicious slogans of all is that 'life insurance must be sold, not bought.' It can be used to cover a multitude of sins and it is easy to insert the words 'double glazing' for life insurance without changing the sense. The system is changing slowly but be suspicious. Check how your adviser is being paid and ask for commissions to be rebated. Paranoia can pay dividends.

text:  JOHN LUSTY Group, the USM-quoted food manufacturer formerly known as Dumas Group, reported pre-tax losses up from Pounds 970,000 to Pounds 2.25m for the year to January 31. Turnover for the year rose slightly, from Pounds 8.62m to Pounds 8.68m. Of this, continuing operations were responsible for Pounds 7.94m (Pounds 7.7m). Losses per share were 19.38p (15.34p). Mr David Hamp-Adams, who took over as chairman after the company's restructuring and name change in February this year, said discussions were under way regarding the sale of Bender and Cassel, which no longer fitted with the group's core activities. The restructuring of the group had already begun to pay off, he said, and despite poor trading conditions, its future now looked more secure than it had for some time.

Turnover improved to Pounds 6.76m (Pounds 6.57m) including a Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.1m) contribution from Haven Services, 51 per cent owned by Anglia. The pre-tax result was after a fall from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 508,000 in exceptional costs and reduced interest payments of Pounds 748,000 (Pounds 1.31m). Losses per share fell to 7.2p (15.4p) and there is no dividend. Anglia last paid a dividend in respect of the year to September 1989. Its share price reached a peak of 458p in March that year, before a collapse in demand for housing. The shares closed unchanged at 6p yesterday. However, Mr Peter Edmondson, chairman, said that prices 'do appear to have reached their floor'. Average prices on the 61 units sold in the six months were Pounds 61,000 (Pounds 60,000). He said that five projects to develop and operate nursing homes were underway with Haven Healthcare Holdings, in which Anglia had a 28 per cent stake. The group was in discussions with its principal bankers to separate its property assets and associated debts from the Haven operations, on which the group had pinned its future hopes, he added.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds ahead 35% to Pounds 498m - Outcome boosted by release of Pounds 154m problem country debt provision 
text:  LLOYDS BANK yesterday disappointed the market with half-year results which showed pressure on retail banking income from slack domestic loan demand. This was despite a 35 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 498m, against Pounds 369m. The pre-tax figure was in line with expectations, but was helped by a higher than expected release of problem country debt provisions of Pounds 154m. This made its problem country debt unit the most profitable of the bank's operating sectors. Lloyds nonetheless covered its dividend 3.5 times after raising it 12 per cent to 6.6p (5.9p), and Mr Brian Pitman, the bank's chief executive, said it was considering ways to redistribute excess capital as earnings grow. Mr Pitman said Reuters' recently announced scheme to spend Pounds 350m buying back 5.8 per cent of its own equity was 'very intriguing' although he had not yet studied it closely. This was one possibility for handing back excess cash. Since Lloyds' failed bid to buy Midland last year, there has been speculation over how it will spend capital. Mr Pitman said it would have to choose when its ratio of equity to total assets rises from the current 4.4 per cent to 6 per cent. The bank was affected by falls in base rates, which reduced earnings on UK interest-free deposits. It lost earnings of Pounds 39.4m on interest-free funds of Pounds 6.4bn as the net interest margin narrowed to 3.97 per cent (4.36 per cent). This squeezed income in UK retail banking, where it made a profit of Pounds 17m (Pounds 3m loss). Operating profits fell by 4 per cent despite a 5 per cent reduction in costs, and provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell to Pounds 209m (Pounds 241m). Mr Pitman said this was a 'hopeless' return on equity of about Pounds 1bn, but the bank believed it could raise returns substantially as provisions fell by cutting costs at 1 per cent per year while raising income 5 per cent a year. Some of Lloyds' ratios were affected by the adoption of an EC directive which requires grossing up of assets, and a new Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice. The bank also adopted the FRS 3 accounting standard for the first time. These changes lowered the restated tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets to 6 per cent (6.2 per cent restated from 6.7 per cent). Including unaudited retained profits, the figure would rise to 6.5 per cent. The ratio of costs to income fell to 65.5 per cent (67.1 per cent restated from 63 per cent). The bank's total operating profit before provisions rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 632m (Pounds 577m restated). But costs rose by Pounds 25m (2 per cent) on exchange rate movements despite a 4 per cent reduction in the number of employees to 62,551. Assets grew 7 per cent on the end of 1992 to Pounds 74bn. Holdings of debt securities rose to Pounds 4.7bn (Pounds 3.4bn), and the acquisition of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation added Pounds 1bn. Customer loans rose marginally to Pounds 39.1bn (Pounds 38.8bn). Mr Pitman said the scope for growing domestic loans was limited by the fact that inflation has fallen. He said the bank would try to generate added income by being more imaginative in devising personal savings products. Provisions fell 34 per cent to Pounds 138m (Pounds 209m), as the bank's problem country debt unit made a profit of Pounds 176m. Excluding the problem country debt provision release, the charge of Pounds 292m was 6 per cent down on the first half of 1992. Earnings per share rose 43 per cent to 23.5p (16.4p) and net assets per share rose 13 per cent to 232p (205p). The shares closed 25p down at 557p. See Lex

The shares have been placed by Cazenove and Henry Cooke Lumsden, the placing being underwritten by Cazenove. The final Pounds 775,000 will be paid after Frenkel has moved its other businesses, involving the mixing and bottling of cooking and salad oils, from the building which houses the varnishes division and is expected to be made within two years. The sale proceeds will be used to finance the move to a new factory near the existing site. In the year to the end of October 1992, the resins and varnish division made pre-tax profits of Pounds 161,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.7m out of group profits of Pounds 755,000 and turnover of Pounds 24.3m.

It is, as the Bruntland Commission says, 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' - surely a goal we all share. To achieve it, we must use all our resources - finite or not - more efficiently, and less wastefully. To encourage this means costing those resources realistically - including environmental costs - paying those costs and including them in both national and corporate accounts. Economic reforms are therefore the key to more efficient use of resources. As you say, 'it is a time for priorities'. But you overlook a main priority: the urgency for governments to step up their efforts to internalise environmental costs - specifically through applying economic instruments on a wider scale, and at a faster pace. They undertook to do this at Rio. Internalising environmental costs will benefit: a) business, by encouraging firms to become 'eco-efficient' - adding value to products, while using raw materials and energy more efficiently, and minimising pollution. This in turn will create competitive advantage, improve corporate returns and reduce risk. b) government, as a more cost-effective, flexible and successful alternative to command-and-control c) environment - including addressing many of the issues you question as really important. Indeed, because few other, if any, single public policy actions would achieve so many benefits, this should be an item marked 'high priority for action' on everyone's agenda - government, business and environmentalists.

text:  Sir, The economic case argued by the 'MIT Six' (Personal View, July 29) for the burial of the exchange rate mechanism is as welcome as it is irrefutable. The Six, however, were late in changing their views. One of them, Rudiger Dornbusch, is on record at a G7C meeting only 14 months ago in claiming that there was nothing wrong with the ERM that a lira devaluation would not cure. The Six indeed have to explain away their erstwhile support of the ERM. They thereby assert that the ERM in its early years was a good system in inducing reductions in inflation but somehow it became rigid and perverse. As you know, together with a very few others, I have argued that there is no evidence that the ERM countries reduced inflation any faster than the outsiders, that the ERM was and is inherently perverse and unstable, and that the political-market forces would induce the same sort of rigidity that we saw in Bretton Woods. All these dynamics, masked until 1990 by exchange controls, became quite clear over the last three years. Black Wednesday was merely one culmination; there are others to come. But what concerns me in the MIT Six article is the stress they appear to put on targeting unemployment - 'putting unemployment at the top of the list (of priorities)'. So we may well risk falling out of the ERM frying pan into a Keynesian inferno. Targeting unemployment, as we know from the post-second world war years, gave us eventually even higher levels of unemployment and rampant inflation. Surely the first priority should be stable monetary policy, not unemployment. At the very least a stable monetary policy should save us from the exacerbations of inflation and recession that we have experienced, either outside or inside the ERM, by pegging sterling to the D-Mark.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / A blow for compromise and conciliation: Israel's military attacks in south Lebanon have damaged Middle East peace hopes 
text:  The Middle East abhors a diplomatic vacuum like no other part of the world. If it is not trying to resolve the worst of its problems through negotiation, then the danger is always there that it will blunder again into war. The latest, and objectively the best hope for resolving the Arab-Israel conflict peacefully sprang out of the war in the Gulf. Some 20 months after Iraq's forces were driven out of Kuwait, the long-festering crisis of Israel's relations with its Arab neighbours was brought to the negotiating table in Madrid. Some 21 months later, with no progress to show, the guns are again firing, civilians are dying and the pitiable sight of hundreds of thousands of refugees fills television screens. Once again, for the third time in 15 years, it is the Lebanese people who are paying the price for the failures, ambitions and short-term political manoeuvring of the region's leaders. This week's relentless attack on the country by Israel, which has already forced at least 250,000 people from their homes, killed 120 and wounded hundreds more, serves interests far removed from those which support conciliation and compromise. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, clearly believes that the military operation is necessary for his government and for his country. Earlier this month, seven Israeli soldiers were killed by guerrillas in south Lebanon, in the slice of territory (about 10 per cent of the country) Israel has occupied since its two earlier ill-fated invasions of 1978 and 1982. Then, as now, the declared aim is to rid the south of Lebanon of guerrilla forces capable of challenging the occupation and of firing rockets into the northern tip of Israel. This time, however, Israel is trying a new tactic. By deliberately driving out the population of the south and making their towns and villages uninhabitable, Mr Rabin is hoping to create such a mass of refugees that the governments of Lebanon and Syria will be forced into taking action against the guerrillas. Israel's prime minister has long believed, along with many of his colleagues, that force can only be answered by force. He was elected a year ago on the twin pledge of peace and security. He has not delivered peace, so the need to ensure security has become even more politically imperative. Mr Rabin may also calculate that the risks to the peace process are secondary and containable. He well knows, as do his Arab negotiating partners, that Israel is totally dominant in the region militarily. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, those Arab countries most opposed to Israel have lost their main military supplier and most constant diplomatic supporter. The risk of a Middle East conflict spilling over into the third world war has gone. Israel, meanwhile, has deepened the already close relationship with its most fervent champion, the US. Washington, in its turn, has declared a policy of seeking to deny Iran and Iraq, potentially the two most powerful economic and military powers in the region, the means to develop their influence. Seen from Jerusalem, it must appear that Israel and the US have the power to dictate events in the Middle East as never before. It is a view shared by many Arab governments. Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians went to Madrid and the nine subsequent rounds of negotiations in Washington because it was the only formula remaining which might, with US involvement, lead to the return of their land occupied by Israel in the 1967 war, as demanded in two UN resolutions. They came to the table essentially as supplicants with little to offer, except the prospect of peace treaties. For governments which until recently had beaten the drum of Arab nationalism, Palestinian self-determination, and unending resistance to Israeli ambitions, it was a chastening and potentially humiliating experience. And the less they achieved, the greater would be the embarrassment of justifying their actions in front of their own populations. By attacking Lebanon in the manner it has, Israel is seeking to strip the last remnants of their formerly hostile political clothing from them. Syria, and the Lebanese government on which it has such strong influence, are being told by the Israelis to put an end to the military activities of Hizbollah, the Iranian-supported group which proclaims that it is fighting a war of national liberation in south Lebanon. Without the curbing of Hizbollah, the civilians of the south will not be allowed to return to their shattered homes, and Lebanon's attempts at reconstruction will come to nought. But Hizbollah is more than a guerrilla movement. It also enjoys widespread support among the Shia community in Lebanon, runs an extensive social welfare programme and won eight seats in the last parliamentary elections. Lebanese ministers are well aware that the only way to reduce Hizbollah's growing influence is by raising the overall economic well-being of Lebanon, a process which Israel has now put firmly into reverse. The parallels with the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza are obvious. There, too, Israel's response to the Palestinian uprising has led to greater economic hardship and an erosion of the popular support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which gave its blessing to the peace process, and a political boost to the radical Islamic forces, which oppose it. For those Israelis who prefer the present situation to the alternative sought by the Arab negotiators, such developments are not unwelcome. It enables them to argue, especially in front of a US audience, that radical Islam has now become the most potent threat not just to Israel, but also to most of the western world. How fully the US accepts this assessment may be clearer in the next few days when Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, sets out once more for the region with his prime objective of promoting peace again overshadowed by the need to limit the damage of war.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Fading sound of music: Why there may be a requiem for one of the world's finest piano makers 
text:  There is hardly a musician who does not know about Bech-stein, one of the world's finest pianos, whose keys were played by Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. There is hardly a Berliner who would not demand its rescue as bankruptcy now hangs over the 140-year-old company. Bechstein has had an uphill struggle since it was bought by Mr Karl Schulze, regarded as a master piano maker, from the US-based Baldwin keyboard manufacturers in 1985. Mr Schulze had only one aim: to restore the international reputation of this grand concert piano. Baldwin had acquired the renowned established family business in the 1960s, and afterwards, the quality of the pianos was compromised, experts say. Its infrequent presence on the concert platform seemed to confirm this perception. Before the second world war, Bechstein and Steinway competed with each other to grace the world's concert halls, Today, about 90 per cent of them are using Steinway, followed by the Vienna-based Bosendorfer. 'Baldwin is a good American firm. It thought it could sell more pianos by capitalising on the name. But each piano has to be crafted, individually made, and cared for,' said Mr Roger Willson, manager of Whelpdale, Maxwell and Codd, a piano manufacturer, and the sole importer into the UK of Bechstein. Soon after acquiring Bechstein, Mr Schulze bought new premises in west Berlin, not far from Checkpoint Charlie, the main crossing point between east and west Berlin, and with help of 68 craftsmen, revived traditional piano-making skills. By the early 1990s, the company was making 350 concert grands and 600 uprights a year. Mr Schulze, confident about the future, decided to expand. He bought a small piano factory in Bavaria, as well as the established Zimmermann piano factory in the eastern German state of Saxony. Then things started to go wrong. An explanation is offered by Mr Willson. 'The recession hit him badly,' he said. 'You see, about 60 per cent of our sales of Bechstein, and Bluthner, another great German piano manufacturer located in Leipzig, is sold to the older generation. With the fall in housing prices, especially in Britain, people held back. These are expensive instruments.' A Bechstein grand costs between DM80,000 (Pounds 31,128) and DM100,000, and an upright between DM18,000 and DM30,000. As a result of the recession, piano sales in the UK fell last year by 15 per cent, to between 10,000 and 12,000. Worldwide, 680,000 pianos were sold, 270,000 fewer than in 1991. The market faces growing competition from Japan, and especially South Korea and China, which have exploited the global downturn by offering low prices and somewhat inferior quality. But, when it comes to concert grands, the Japanese are up against a bias which favours European tradition and craftsmanship. Some German bankers say that Mr Schulze expanded at the wrong time. But another factor could be that unlike his competitors, Steinway and Bosendorfer, both of which are owned by US companies, Beckstein has no private backers. 'He did it alone. It would be a shame to see Bechstein disappear,' said Mr Michael Glazebrook, director of technical services at Steinway. Because of the recession, Bechstein's bankers, Dresdener and Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank in Berlin, have been reluctant to provide loans of about DM3m to the company, which saw turnover fall by 15 per cent to DM20m last year. This year it may be even lower, at DM15m. Without financial backing from the Senate, Berlin's city government or from a consortium of bankers, Bechstein could be forced into liquidation. The irony is that Bechstein's bankers have refused their support at a time when other great piano manufacturers, particularly those in east Germany, are slowly re-establishing their reputations. These include Bluthner and Zimmermann, both based in Saxony. Bluthner was founded in 1853, and was chosen for concert performances by Felix Mendelssohn, Arthur Rubenstein, and Claudio Arrau, the latter one of the finest interpreters of Beethoven's sonatas. Ingbert Bluthner, a direct descendant, managed to bring the business back into the family in 1990 from communist state control. He began to market the piano again, and opened a workshop to recondition second-hand instruments. 'It is difficult, but we are surviving, and we are regaining our traditional niche in the upper end of the market,' said Ms Gitta Grosse, manager of Bluthner's showrooms in Leipzig. 'You must remember that we had no chance to compete, or gain access to high-quality parts for our piano under the old system. This has all changed,' she added. 'The quality of Bluthner is much better now,' said Mr Willson. 'It has that lovely soft tone.' Zimmermann, which caters for the middle end of the market, has also regained its reputation as a high-quality family piano. But its fortunes depend on the fate of Bechstein. 'If Bechstein is allowed to fail, it would be very sad. We are talking about quality, about a name, about craftsmanship, which Germany is so good at, and which people still want. The Bechstein is as famous as Berlin's coat of arms, the bear,' said Mr Willson. Steinway's Mr Glazebrook added: 'Some would think we would be delighted to see the end of Bechstein because it would mean less competition. But it's not like that at all. It's about retaining the continuity of quality and tradition.' The Senate, and any prospective rescuer, will next week have to decide the price it will pay for maintaining, or neglecting, that tradition.

text:  Sir, In his article on the future of the London orchestras (Arts, July 24/25) Sir Alan Peacock asserted derogatorily that 'many serious composers of today are not primarily interested in winning over the public'. But why should they be? Those composers whose works are most likely to stand the test of time are by definition avant-garde in the sense that their unique creativity extends musical boundaries beyond the previous experience of the listening public. The 20th century is notable (and notorious) for the number of major compositions that did not win over the public when first performed, but which have subsequently become standard works in the repertoire. If the Arts Council lacks both historical perspective and vision and expects all composers to be user-friendly and market-oriented it will stifle the imperative originality from which great works spring.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Hatchet honed to a softer point: Robert Horton, former boss of BP, is changing his abrasive image for the chairmanship of Railtrack 
text:  If there is one thing worse than being spoken of unkindly, it is not being spoken of at all. Anyone who doubts it should consider the case of Robert Horton, the man who will take charge of Britain's 10,000-mile network of railway tracks next April when rail privatisation starts coming into effect. Barely a year ago, in one of the most sensational palace coups in recent UK corporate history, Mr Horton was ousted from his position as chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum with accusations of abrasiveness and megalomania ringing in his ears. Now, as chairman of Railtrack, the government-owned company that will take over the tracks from British Rail next year, he is preparing to re-enter the public arena in a job that will not only thrust him more than ever into prominence, but threatens to turn him into an object of vilif-ication if he fulfils people's worst fears about what he might do. Mr Horton, 53, is a government appointee to the chairmanship of Railtrack. That is bad enough for members of the rail lobby, since they mistrust ministers' commitment to the railways. But far more disturbing is Mr Horton's reputation as an axe man ('Horton the Hatchet', as the sobriquet has it), for it recalls the swingeing cuts to the railway system instigated by another Conservative government appointee in the 1960s - Dr Richard (later Baron) Beeching, then-chairman of the British Railways Board. Mr Horton's reputation for toughness was built up during a 35-year climb to the top at BP. His record was that of an aggressive cost-cutter, first in the tanker and chemical divisions and then as head of BP's North American operations. Mr Horton's determination and boundless ambition went down well in the US, where they satisfied notions of what captains of industry should be. But his American-style management methods were less well received in the UK when Mr Horton became chairman and chief executive in 1990. He made it his mission to shake up a corporate culture stultified by bureaucracy. Head office committees were abolished, layers of management were swept away, and thousands of jobs went. Responsibility was delegated to unit managers, who were told that they would 'own' problems and be 'empowered' to deal with them. Unfortunately the changes coincided with adverse economic conditions which caused a sharp fall in profits. Worse, Mr Horton generated personal antagonism with his reputation for arrogance. 'Because I am blessed by my good brain, I tend to get to the right answer rather quicker and more often than most people,' he said in a notorious interview with Forbes, the American business magazine. In June last year, his fellow directors decided they could no longer work with him and cast him out. But Mr Horton was not to stay out of the limelight for long. As chairman of Railtrack, he may have exchanged the Pounds 787,000 he earned in his last year at BP for a more modest annual salary of Pounds 120,000; he may have left BP's palatial City headquarters for a dowdy, down-at-heel office block opposite Russell Square tube station; but he is back. He is also at pains to soften the harder edges of his image. Whatever else he may have been brought into Railtrack to do, he says, it is not to take an axe to the railway network. 'It is very different from the situation I found in the oil industry, because BP had diversified into a lot of businesses that were not core, such as minerals and animal feed,' he says. 'It seemed to me that an oil company ought to stick to being an oil and petrochemicals company. But railways are quite different: railways are a core activity in themselves, and I have absolutely no intention of being a Dr Beeching mark two.' Rather, he says, his goals are to improve the quality of the existing infrastructure and to increase capacity by installing better signalling systems and removing bottlenecks. 'I believe in the efficiency of public transport, and far from wanting to reduce what is available, I want railways to become a more popular and more used mode of travel.' If this sounds slightly suspect coming from someone whose previous business was making petrol for cars, Mr Horton is ready to acknowledge it. 'Obviously with my background, I start from the point of view that the car is a great liberator for people who, 40 years ago, would not have travelled beyond the town they lived in,' he says. 'But we are faced with a situation in which this cannot continue in an unfettered way because we live in a little island with a lot of people and a lot of beautiful countryside, and we don't want to see it turned into a concrete jungle.' The implication of that, says Mr Horton, is that motorists will sooner or later have to start paying more for the use of the roads, so encouraging a switch to rail for goods and passenger transport. So is Mr Horton the railwayman's friend? It would seem so. One difficulty he cannot gloss over, however, is how he will fund the track improvements he wants at a time when the prospects of getting more money out of the government are close to zero. An easy solution would be to raise the money from the train operators by inflicting high charges for the use of the tracks. But that is not Mr Horton's plan - nor, presumably, the government's - for it would mean either large and politically unacceptable fare increases or bigger state subsidies for the train operators. Instead, the money will have to come from efficiency gains within Railtrack's operations. And this, above all, is why Horton the Hatchet has been drafted into the railways - to take an axe to Railtrack's costs, so easing fears among would-be train operators that their track charges will be dictated by a lazy, inefficient monopoly. Railtrack will be a lean machine, says Mr Horton. Its headquarters will employ about 150 people, half from BR and half from the private sector. The company will also take on BR's signalling and train control staff, taking employee numbers to 10,000-12,000. But everything else - track maintenance, signalling renewal, engineering work and the rest - will be contracted out, with BR's existing staff competing with the private sector for the work. Job losses are potentially large: BR employs 40,000 people on track maintenance and engineering. But Mr Horton is politician enough to duck the question of exactly how many will go: 'I am not going to say - that's just asking for trouble.' The other big change will be the creation of 10 geographical zones to run Railtrack's day-to-day operations. Managers will be given a high degree of devolved power to run their businesses, Mr Horton says. Headquarters will set quarterly targets and zonal managers will be left to achieve them, with financial rewards geared to the degree of success. If this begins to sound like the 'empowerment' which Mr Horton so strongly advocated in the past, he is not about to disagree. 'I have not fallen in love with committees since I left BP,' he says. Nor does it sound as though he is planning any drastic changes in his management style. If you lead from the front and take difficult decisions, people will say you are arrogant and abrasive, which I don't think I am,' he says. 'I think my management style is actually highly consultative - I really do delegate. But I believe in active leadership and not ducking leadership, and in a complicated business there is limited scope for endless debate.' Even so, the bruising circumstances of Mr Horton's exit from BP have left some scars. He speaks bitterly of the events leading up to his departure: 'I had over 30 very happy and stimulating years in the oil industry. It was hardly my fault that the deepest recession for 30 years was under way.' Is this then a new, softer, gentler Bob Horton taking charge of Britain's railway infrastructure? 'Possibly,' he says. 'Possibly. I am very conscious of the fact that I have a lot of learning left to do. Mind you, so has everyone. We are at a new dawn now.'

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Handbagged by grey power: Can Major rebound after the humiliation of Christchurch 
text:  A bloody nose in Newbury. A kick in the teeth in Christchurch. Mr John Major cannot take much more of it before he crashes to the canvas. After the loss of Newbury in May, the prime minister sacked his chancellor. The ghost of Mr Norman Lamont lives on. If there was a single factor which ensured the government would be humiliated in Christchurch, it was the decision in his last Budget to impose VAT on domestic fuel. But the Christchurch result said much more about Mr Major's administration - and his premiership. The government and its leader have fallen out with their own people. The footsoldiers of Toryism in southern England are seething. Unless he wins them back, the prime minister is doomed. The by-election result was as awful as the government's worst fears. By the final days of the campaign, ministers had given up any hope of holding what only a year ago was their 15th safest seat. In the event, the 16,427 majority secured by Mrs Diana Maddock, the less-than-inspiring Liberal Democrat candidate, broke all postwar records. No Conservative government since 1945 has seen a 35 per cent swing against it. Nor has any previous administration witnessed such a dramatic fall in its own vote. The traditional refuge after Tory by-election disasters - blaming the local activists' dud candidate - is not on offer this week. Mr Rob Hayward, an experienced former MP, made his mistakes. But those on the ground judged that, on balance, he won rather than lost votes. Mr Major's reaction was predictable. Christchurch marked the end of a wretched year for his government. But it was backward- not forward-looking. The electors were responding to the economic recession and to the disarray caused by the Tory civil war over Europe. He could draw comfort from Labour's dismal performance. Mr John Smith may claim that his party's lost deposit in Christchurch was the inevitable result of tactical voting. But the outcome - coupled with a similar humiliation in Newbury - can hardly enhance Labour's pretension to be a party which can again win seats across the south of England. Mr Smith, embroiled in his own, damaging, internal dispute with the trade unions, cannot rely on the government's mistakes to deliver votes to his party. The long summer parliamentary recess offers Mr Major a respite. The Conservative party at Westminster has been denied its opportunity to panic. The turmoil in European currency markets has raised a question mark over prospects for the economy, but the odds are that the British upturn will continue to take hold. Another interest rate cut might sweeten the October party conference. Maastricht is history. Wise souls on the Tory backbenches believe time will prove the commentators wrong: those who follow events at Westminster have made the classic mistake of projecting into the future the mood of the recent past. Mr John Biffen, the eloquent elder statesman of the liberal Tory right, left for his summer break this week predicting the 'black misery' of Christchurch would be followed by much calmer autumn waters. As economic recovery began to be felt by the voters, Mr Major would have another chance to get to grips with his domestic policy agenda. But drawing lines under past disasters has become quite a habit for this government - under its forced exit from the exchange rate mechanism, under coal industry closures, under turmoil in the schools, under Norman Lamont. The lines rarely seem to last. For all the brave ministerial speeches yesterday, the cabinet looks tired and purposeless. Mr Major does not look prime ministerial; the voters judge him weak. He has still to articulate a convincing political agenda. Mr Michael Heseltine's energy is sorely missed. Mr John Patten has been sidelined by a stress-related stomach illness. Others around the cabinet table are preoccupied with survival, not buzzing with ideas. Mr Kenneth Clarke is an exception. But Christchurch has narrowed greatly the options for what must be a tough November Budget. Senior Whitehall officials predict he will resist the pressure from the Tory backbenches to delay the introduction of VAT on fuel. It was not his policy but he has defended it vigorously. But the voters have delivered a warning that they will not tolerate further tax or spending changes which fall heavily on the government's supporters. Grey power has come of age in suburban England. The chancellor might as well rule out now any further extension of VAT beyond, perhaps, to newspapers. There will have to be generous compensation to offset the pain of higher fuel costs. Every proposed saving in welfare benefits and health service provision will now have to be weighed against the reaction of the once-loyal battalions of home counties pensioners now marching under Mr Paddy Ashdown's banner. The Liberal Democrat leader was wise yesterday not to draw extravagant conclusions from the party's recent undoubted successes. There was too much talk in the 1980s of 'breaking the mould'. Mr Ashdown's troops remain preoccupied with local rather than national politics. The team which Mrs Maddock will join at Westminster is hardly full of sparkling talent. Mr Ashdown has yet to establish a coherent national strategy for his party but he is capitalising - like Mr Ross Perot in the US last year - on the mood of anti-politics which has swept through the west. Taken together, Newbury, the county council elections on the same day, and Christchurch, have seen the Liberal Democrats advance steadily eastwards from their West Country strongholds. The party is beginning to entrench in areas which the Conservatives have long taken for granted. Up to two dozen Tory MPs are now looking anxiously over their shoulders at the threat to their seats come the general election. They are warning the prime minister that it will take more than a gentle economic recovery to erase the bitterness cause by the 'betrayals' of the past year. They are reminding him that they represent the difference between Conservative and Labour government. If he does not pay heed, they will join the disenchanted and dispossessed on the Tory backbenches who have already given up on Mr Major's leadership.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Pragmatism v dogmatism 
text:  BATTERED AND drowsy, the European exchange rate mechanism looks to be on its last legs. Miraculous recoveries have been known before. But unless Europe's finance ministers are able to hatch a plan over this weekend which can promise to deliver a sizeable cut in French interest rates very soon, the prospects for fixed exchange rates surviving in Europe, other than among a small core of Germany's north European partners, look slim. What is needed is a pragmatic and face-saving escape route for the French government which can deliver lower rates without requiring the abandonment of its European ambitions and commitments. It is in Bonn, more than Frankfurt and even Paris, that the hard thinking must take place. Germany's political leaders, rudely awakened in their holiday retreats, must put past errors and disagreements behind them. Yes, Bundesbank council members can rightly complain that it is the German government's budget profligacy that has required them to keep interest rates so high. Yes, German government ministers can mutter that France should not have resisted a upward realignment of the D-Mark when it still made sense. Nor are French remonstrations about the Bundesbank's lamentable performance over the past week likely to help in the search for a route out of the current crisis. Reasonable people can disagree about whether recession-troubled Germany really does face a short-term inflationary threat. But it was perfectly within the Bundesbank council's rights to resist a cut in its discount rate if it truly believed that such a cut would run counter to its declared aim of securing medium-term price stability in Germany. But the French can complain about the Bundesbank's failure to quell the widespread rumour before Thursday's council meeting that a discount rate cut was imminent. Indeed, by cutting the repo rate almost to the discount rate floor on Wednesday, the bank actively fed those rumours. Ruled out Still, the substance, not the style, of the Bundesbank's decision was what set off yesterday's turmoil on the foreign exchanges. For the Bundesbank has effectively ruled out a cut in interest rates in the ERM, as currently constituted for some weeks. This realisation was enough to undermine confidence in the ability of Belgium, Denmark and, most important, France to live with the high real interest rates that Germany's fiscal difficulties are transmitting across Europe. Intervention, on an unprecedented scale in Europe's monetary history, could not keep the French franc from falling out of its ERM bands. The future of Franco-German monetary relations has thus reached a crucial juncture. The time has now passed when public statements of commitment to current parities from the French minsters can do much good. Regardless of the hopes and wishes of the French government, the markets do not now appear to believe that France can maintain interest rates at their current levels. The gap between the market rates and prime rates is too large, the banking system too weak, the French economy too troubled and the erosion of public support for the franc fort policy, in the face of rising unemployment, too rapid. Any effort to sweat next week out will probably end in failure. Economic reality Nor is a realignment, or modest widening of bands, likely to buy anything more than a fleeting breathing space. France, Belgium and Denmark are not burdened by uncompetitive exchange rates, but by much higher interest rates than their excellent inflation performances require. A realignment cannot work unless it persuades the Bundesbank to cut German interest rates. But Germany's inflationary pressures are in the service sector, where the impact of a higher exchange rate is negligible. In the private sector, where a stronger D-Mark would bite, deflation is currently the problem. The only other alternative, short of a rapid and politically improbable move to monetary union, is temporarily to sever the Franco-German monetary link. France can no longer afford to ignore the economic reality that Germany's particular problems demand a tighter monetary policy than France can sustain. What is needed is a way to break the link in a manner consistent with the French government's political pledges: to stay in the ERM and to honour the spirit of the Maastricht treaty. The solution is for the German government to propose what now seems economically rational, if politically very difficult: the temporary departure of the D-Mark from the ERM. The remaining ERM member countries should then announce an immediate 2 percentage point cut in interest rates, perhaps accompanied by a move to narrower bands. France may blanche at such an outcome. But, by choosing pragmatism, both Paris and Bonn would signal a partial but honourable retreat from their joint monetary aspirations. Trying to soldier on looks increasingly likely to deliver an inferior outcome, and in a much more ignominious fashion.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Man in the News: Fixer who may come unstuck - Dan Rostenkowski 
text:  It is the best of times and the worst of times for Mr Dan Rostenkowski. The burly Chicago Democrat has been in his element, bullying and cajoling his congressional colleagues towards a deal on President Bill Clinton's budget. As chairman of the Ways and Means committee of the House of Representatives, Mr Rostenkowski is, as always, central to tax negotiations. But he remains the target of a two-year criminal investigation by federal prosecutors who have requisitioned a dozen years of his cheques, bills and campaign documents, and subpoenaed his staff, his friends and his daughters. Last week, Mr Robert Rota, the former House of Representatives postmaster, pleaded guilty to three misdemeanour charges, including aiding 'Congressman A' to embezzle at least Dollars 21,300 between 1985 and 1991 by giving him cash in exchange for office expense vouchers made out for stamp purchases. The amounts and dates of the vouchers filed with the court match those listed in separate House records for Mr Rostenkowski. Mr Rostenkowski last week reaffirmed that he was 'innocent of any wrongdoing', and no charges of any kind have been filed against him. But Mr Rota's plea has made many in Mr Rostenkowski's two home cities of Washington and Chicago conclude that it is only a matter of time before he faces indictment, and with it, under Democratic Party rules, removal from the Ways and Means chairmanship. His critics have often dismissed him as a typical Chicago machine politician, and indeed, like his mentor, Mayor Richard Daley, who brought the system of patronage and political favours to perfection in his rule over the city from 1955 until his death in 1976, he has always known the importance of getting his supporters' streets swept and finding jobs for their nephews. In his 20s, when trying to make it as a professional baseball player, he trimmed his name to Rosten, but regained the -kowski when he entered politics, aged 24, following in his father's footsteps as a member of the Illinois state legislature. He still lives in the house where he was born,in a Polish-American community on Chicago's north-west side, and keeps only a sparse, one-bedroom flat in Washington. His wife, LaVerne, does not come to Washington. He still delivers for Chicago, winning the city regular federal money for roads, transit systems and public housing. Mr Rostenkowski is also defiantly old school in his way of doing business, which involves a mastery of the art of compromise, backed up by endless loyalty and considerable courage. meaning what precise He is unmatched in his ability to read the mood of the House, to sense the exact combination of concessions and bullying that will be needed to strike a deal. His legislative monument is probably the 1986 tax reform, which lowered income tax rates in exchange for the elimination of a host of deductions and loopholes. The measure never commanded much popular support, but Mr Rostenkowski manoeuvred it through a reluctant House making concessions only to members who would promise to back the bill. It finally put paid to Mr Rostenkowski's earlier reputation for political laziness ' for being quick to shoot down a bill that he judged would not pass the House, but slower to do the hard work needed to get tough measures into law. As chairman he demands the same from members of his Ways and Means committee, which has jurisdiction over almost all the revenue legislation and almost half of the spending that passes through Congress. He has little patience for the Senate, whose convoluted procedural rules he finds impede the constructive work of legislation, and none at all for senators who retire in frustration. 'You don't quit. You fix the machinery,' he says. He has no time at all for members of Congress who condone public criticism of their institution, reserving particular scorn for those who seek to curb their own pay. 'Sure there are perquisites that come with the job. But you know as well as I do that perks can't make up for the birthdays, ballgames, holidays and meals that we miss,' he says. Making no secret of his belief that he is worth a great deal more than his congressional salary of Dollars 133,600 a year, Mr Rostenkowski lives a lifestyle that systematically exploits these perks. Travel, often to golfing events, is paid for by business and lobbying groups; and meals by Mr Rostenkowski's campaign fund or his political action committee, which raises money to support other candidates. Blurred lines between political and social activities are not unusual in Congress. But few can match the chairman of Ways and Means in his ability to reap the rewards of office. Indeed, Mr Rostenkowski's skill at stretching his perks to the limit is the reason why many colleagues find it hard to believe that he would have gone beyond those limits. Why would he embezzle small change from the House post office when he could legally have pocketed more than Dollars 1m from his campaign fund if he had retired last year, under a law which left longserving members of Congress subject to older, looser campaign finance rules. The question hangs unspoken over the conference room in which House negotiators, led by Mr Rostenkowski, argue with their Senate counterparts over a compromise budget bill and complaining about the 'do-nothing' Senate's inability to pass anything with even the slightest grain of controversy. For all the reformism of the last 20 years, in which clean politics has come to outweigh good policy with US public opinion, it has often seemed over the last week of negotiations that Mr Rostenkowski's old school arm-twisting skills were as much in demand as ever. The budget agreed by the Democrats yesterday, however, marks a victory for the 'do-nothing' Senate and a failure for Mr Rostenkowski. It may also sound the knell for a politician from another era.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Fuel for thought on VAT: A Tory party memo has found its way to John Willman 
text:  Chancellor, I thought you might welcome a memorandum setting out the policy options over the extension of VAT to domestic fuel and power, widely blamed for our humiliation in the Christchurch by-election. I assume that you do not wish to withdraw the extension - popular though this would be. VAT on domestic fuel at 8 1/2 per cent in 1994 will raise almost Pounds 1bn; the second-stage increase to 17 1/2 per cent in 1995 will raise Pounds 2.3bn a year thereafter. Unless you put up other taxes to raise similar amounts, the markets would see this as a fatal weakening in your resolve to curb government borrowing. The Treasury gilts people would have a fit. I read in the press that you thought about going ahead with the first-stage rise to 8 1/2 per cent in 1994, but scrapping the second-stage increase. The same newspapers say that the deficit would be made up by extending VAT to other zero-rated items such as food and children's clothes. I assume this bizarre suggestion was designed to frighten backbenchers away from scrapping VAT on domestic fuel. If you are going ahead with VAT on domestic fuel, quick action is needed to substantiate your predecessor's pledge to 'help people on low incomes'. There is good news and bad news, chancellor. The good news is that you can help most people on low incomes - though it will swallow up about a third of the additional rev-enue from the rise in VAT. The bad news is that you can't help everybody. Worse, you can only compensate people for average rises in fuel bills. People with higher-than-average bills will get less than they need and will still feel aggrieved. People who get more than they need are unlikely to draw attention to this. I understand that Peter Lilley (social security secretary) is anxious to announce a package at the party conference in October. Here are some points to think about: Don't make the mistake Mr Portillo (chief secretary to the Treasury) made of saying compensation for higher fuel prices can be left to the annual uprating of social security benefits in line with the retail prices index. First, uprating is retroactive - so pensioners, the disabled and low-income families would get a benefits increase only after a year of paying higher fuel bills. Second, most people know the poorest households spend a higher-than-average proportion of their income on keeping warm and need more than average compensation. Paying an extra 80p a week to people on means-tested benefits from next April would compensate them for VAT at 8 per cent on the average fuel bill of the poorest 20 per cent of households, according to our Social Security Advisory Committee. That means finding about Pounds 360m next year and Pounds 720m a year from 1995 when the second-stage increase is imposed. This looks cheap at the price. We need some way of dealing with the criticism that the fuel price increases will also hit many pensioners just above the income level for means-tested benefits. I suggest we put a decent sum - say Pounds 100m  - into a scheme to provide them with home insulation grants. This would also bolster our green justification of the VAT increase. Politically, the cost of this package, more than Pounds 800m when the full VAT increase is imposed, is a small price to pay. You could always cover the cost by imposing VAT on newspapers which would raise more than Pounds 1bn and teach the treacherous tabloids a lesson.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Court rejects Rees-Mogg Maastricht claim 
text:  LORD REES-MOGG yesterday lost his High Court attempt to block ratification of the Maastricht treaty. In a short and precise judgment the court rejected his claim that the government was acting unlawfully by seeking to ratify the treaty without parliamentary approval. Lord Justice Lloyd said that the court did not doubt the issues were 'of great moment' but it was 'an exaggeration to describe it as the most important constitutional case for 300 years'. The former editor of The Times was not in court to hear the decision. His son Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg said that his father had been unable to break a long-standing engagement in Switzerland. He said that his father and his financial backers, who include the international financier Sir James Goldsmith, would consider the judgment in detail before deciding whether to appeal. Mr Rees-Mogg denied that by bringing the action his father was merely making political mischief. 'It's been done as an important constitutional issue. There's no question of my father doing it merely to cause trouble, none at all.' Lord Rees-Mogg was ordered to pay the government's legal costs. Mr Rees-Mogg said he did not know how expensive the legal challenge had been, but added, 'it's not cheap'. Giving the court's judgment, Lord Justice Lloyd, sitting with Lord Justice Mann and Mr Justice Auld, said Lord Rees-Mogg had advanced three arguments. First, by ratifying the social protocol the government intended to increase the powers of the European parliament without parliamentary approval as required by the 1978 European Parliamentary Elections Act. Second, by ratifying the social protocol the government would be altering the content of EC law without parliamentary approval. Finally, by ratifying Title V of the Maastricht treaty, which deals with a common foreign and security policy, the government would be transferring part of the royal prerogative to the European Council without statutory authority. The judge said that the first argument failed because section 1(2) of the 1993 European Communities (Amendment) Act contained a clear and unambiguous approval by parliament of the Maastricht treaty as a whole, including all the protocols. The protocols were ancillary or incidental to the Maastricht treaty and ratification of the treaty would automatically involve ratification of the protocols. On the second issue, Mr David Pannick QC, for Lord Rees-Mogg, had argued that by ratifying the social protocol the government would be altering community law under the Treaty of Rome, which was now the fundamental law of the UK, and parliament alone could change UK law. Although the UK had opted out of the social chapter, the government had agreed to authorise the other 11 member states to effect it through EC institutions - and that could have an indirect effect on UK domestic law, Mr Pannick said. But the judge said that a possible indirect effect on domestic law was 'far too slender a basis on which to hold that parliament has impliedly excluded or curtailed the crown's prerogative to alter or add to the Treaty of Rome'. Lord Justice Lloyd said the third argument was 'the most interesting; but also the weakest'. Because Title V was an inter-governmental agreement it was possible for the court simply to accept that since no question of domestic law was involved it had no jurisdiction to consider the matter. But assuming the issue was justiciable, even if Title V was read 'with an eye most favourable to Mr Pannick's argument, it cannot be regarded as a transfer of prerogative powers,' he said. Title V did not entail an abandonment or transfer of prerogative powers; but an exercise of those powers, he added. It should be read in the same light as the UN and Nato charters.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Generators could face curbs 
text:  BRITAIN's TWO largest electricity generators could be subjected to price controls or be asked to sell plant after Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, completes a review of their costs and profit margins later this year. Prof Littlechild raised these possibilities yesterday as he announced the results of a preliminary inquiry into why selling prices in the wholesale electricity pool have risen by 20 per cent this year. He indicated these could be alternatives to referring National Power and PowerGen to the Monopolies Commission if he found that they had increased the prices they charge to the electricity wholesale pool excessively. They would be preferable to profit controls, he said. Prof Littlechild said the many electricity customers who had complained about the pool price rises were right to be concerned. 'In a competitive market, customers' interests would be paramount. This is not yet the case in the electricity market.' The generators received average pool revenues which exceeded their avoidable costs. 'The need to cover avoidable costs does not justify any further price increases. Nor did it justify an increase as high as the recent one (since April). 'Customers assert that prices would be lower in a more competitive market. The generators could counter these assertions by competing more aggressively on the pool price.' Prof Littlechild said the electricity pool should base prices on both demand and supply. One suggestion is that demand side bidding be introduced, whereby consumers could be paid if they agreed to stop taking electricity when prices rose to a certain level. The regulator said that the pool should also look closely at rules under which generators are compensated if plant is constrained off the system by the National Grid, which operates it. Prof Littlechild is also asking the pool and the National Grid to consider a 'more appropriate division of responsibilities' for transmission and administration costs. Many of the costs were simply passed on to the customer. They could be met by the grid taking wider responsibility and recovering money through charges. Existing arrangements did not provide enough incentive to cut costs, he said. Alternatively some of the costs could be dealt with by the pool rather than the grid. Pool Price Statement, July 1993.

text:  MR STEPHEN MERRETT, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, yesterday criticised a Lloyd's review into losses by one of his syndicates, Richard Lapper writes. The review was started in 1991 when losses from 1983, left open because of uncertainty about the eventual cost of claims, exceeded Pounds 19.6m. Syndicate 421, one of a number managed by Merrett Holdings, specialised in so-called long-tail business in which claims can occur many years after the policies' inception. Mr Merrett said in a letter to the 341 Names - individuals whose assets support the market: 'In our opinion the report produces virtually nothing that could be thought to be new and relevant information.' The Names face losses of Pounds 57,000 for each Pounds 10,000 traded. The review focused on the underwriting of seven run-off contracts, which generated most of the loss. Losses on the contracts, which reinsured other syndicates and insurance companies, initially arose from US asbestosis claims. The review says that 'the risks assumed resulted in Syndicate 421 having a substantial exposure to potential adverse developments on old years of account in respect of much older and larger syndicates, an effective concentration of risk into a new and small syndicate'. Mr Merrett said the review should have looked more specifically into the circumstances surrounding the deterioration of results in 1990, when claims from environmental pollution accounted for almost 90 per cent of a cash call for Pounds 5.6m. The Court of Appeal yesterday ruled that Lloyd's Names unable to pay their losses can sue their agents for negligence. Names originally won the case in the High Court in May.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Voting swings and roundabouts hit Tories: David Butler analyses the result and concludes that while the government has no excuse for the dramatic loss, time will ease the burdens of defeat 
text:  CHRISTCHURCH was not quite the record-breaking result that some have suggested. The 31 per cent drop in the Conservative share of the vote far exceeds their worst performances in the Thatcher-Major era - 24 per cent in Richmond in 1989 and 23 in Ribble Valley in 1991 - but it was topped by the 32 per cent Tory slump in Rochdale in 1958 and Labour's drop of 38 per cent in Bermondsey in 1982. The Conservatives have been quick to find comfort in history. Their worst by-election disaster in each of their last four parliaments in office were reversed in the subsequent general election. But the Conservatives have no excuses. Nothing in the constituency or the candidate or the campaign was especially adverse, they suffered from the greatest anti-government swing on record because the government is unpopular. The public has, at least temporarily, lost confidence in the Conservatives' ability to govern. The Liberal Democrats have learned the art of not boasting during a by-election campaign and even their stupendous triumph is being downplayed. Victory has too often been followed by disappointment. But the triumphs of Newbury and Christchurch will enable the party to recruit money and candidates in a way that will add to their credibility when they come to try to pick up a few seats in the Euro-elections next June. Although they are the largest Liberal party in the Community, the first-past-the-post electoral system has denied them representation at Strasbourg. For Labour to find comfort it must look to its nationwide poll standing  - 44 per cent, 17 points ahead of the Tories and 19 points ahead of the Liberal Democrats. In Newbury, its vote fell from 6 per cent to 2 per cent. In Christchurch the fall was proportionately greater from 12 per cent to 6 per cent. Labour had prudently hinted in advance that its supporters were welcome to be beastly to the Tories in any way they saw fit - a tacit encouragement to the tactical voting that has become increasingly prevalent. But tactical voting does not work symmetrically. Most Labour voters prefer Liberal Democrats to the Tories. The Liberal Democrats are more evenly divided. There are few seats where tactical vot-ing greatly helps Labour. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, cannot countenance a formal pact with Labour just because it would drive so many of his supporters into the arms of the Conservatives. One feature of government by-election disasters is that the record swings have always been to the centre, not to the main opposition party. Although the Christchurch swing would oust the Conservatives in every seat, the movement would surely be much less in seats where Labour was the challenger. This year the Liberal Democrats have scored two huge victories in the safest of Conservative seats. No one expects places of this sort to fall in a general election. And there's the rub for Mr Ashdown - it is in the safer Conservative seats that his party fares best. Liberal Democrat strength is not in the right places. If all three parties won equal votes in the next election, Conservatives and Labour would each get more than twice as many seats as the Liberal Democrats. Thursday confirms the new law. No government seat can be held in a by-election. No Tory MP can hope for a peerage or a plum job while this parliament lasts and no seat could be found for Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, or any alternative saviour. Mr John Major's Huntingdon, the safest of all Conservative seats, would have been lost by 10,000 on the Christchurch swing. The only vacancies will come from mortality. Actuarial calculations suggest that six more Conservatives MPs are likely to perish before the next dissolution. In the previous three parliaments death caused Tory vacancies at the rate of two a year. Six by-election losses would reduce the government's majority from 17 to five - but, with luck, that would not happen until 1996. Even the most sensational of by-election results creates but a small ripple in the ocean of time. The impact of Christchurch will be deadened by the summer recess. When the politicians and commentators return from their holidays their eyes will be on the party conferences. Will the unions behave themselves for Labour? Will the Euro-sceptics behave themselves for the Conservatives? The government must hope for no more by-elections, but an economic recovery may be slow and the lag between economic recovery and political recovery may be considerable. Mr Major and his party have a rough road ahead. But one can exaggerate how much Christchurch adds to their burdens. The author is a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Ministers urge Tories to unite on policies 
text:  SENIOR MINISTERS yesterday began a concerted effort to unite the Tories behind a strategy of sticking to their policies, after the Conservatives' disastrous showing in the Christchurch by-election. But there were warnings from some Tory backbenchers that the clear message after the overthrow of what was a Conservative stronghold just 15 months ago was that the government should change course. Mr Paddy Ashdown said that his party's emphatic victory showed the Liberal Democrats 'on a clear upward curve'. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, sought to shrug off the party's lost deposit in the Dorset constituency. But other Labour MPs expressed fears about the implications of the result for Labour in the south of England. The Tory fightback was led by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who attacked the 'incoherence' of Liberal Democrat policies over the social chapter, value added tax on fuel and the role of British forces in Bosnia. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, urged the party not to look for people or policies to blame for the defeat, since it had already suffered so much from appearing disunited. 'No one should write us off. We will come fighting back, stronger than before,' she said. Conservative MPs seemed inclined, however, to ignore her call not to seek scapegoats, putting Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, and the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel clearly in the firing line. There were also longer-term warnings about the position of Mr John Major himself unless the party's fortunes improved. Mr William Powell, MP for Corby, said that at the very least, ministers should not go ahead with raising VAT on household fuel bills to 17.5 per cent in 1995. Other Tories said it was a sign that taxes themselves were so unpopular with erstwhile Tory voters that there should be cuts in public spending rather than any tax increases in the November Budget. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, compared the prime minister with a door-to-door salesman, telling BBC radio that in politics as in business, 'if people don't like what you're offering they will slam the door in your face'. Mr Ashdown hailed the Liberal Democrats' success as confirmation of voters' determination to see better government in Britain, and said it was fresh proof that in the 'heartlands of the south' only his party could beat the Tories. Mrs Beckett's insistence that across the south of England Labour was far more often the challenger to the Conservatives than the Liberal Democrats, was somewhat undermined by Mr Bryan Gould, Labour MP for Dagenham and a former shadow cabinet member, who said the result had 'disturbing lessons' for the party. He said the party should recognise that it was still not identifying enough with voters in the south and that it needed to develop policies they would find 'meaningful and attractive'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHRISTCHURCH BY-ELECTION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Candidate/party                              Votes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Diana Maddock (L Dem)                       33,164                           (General election 13,612) Rob Hayward (Con)                           16,737                                            (36,627) Nigel Lickley (Labour)                       1,453                                             (6,997)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alan Sked (Anti-Maastricht Anti-Federalist) 878; Andrew Bannon (Conservative Candidate) 357; Lord David Sutch (Monster Raving Loony) 404; Peter Newman (Sack Graham Taylor) 80; Tara Bardot Jackson (Buy the Daily Sport) 67; Peter Hollyman (Save the NHS) 60; John Crockard (Highlander IV Wednesday Promotion Night) 48; Mark Griffiths (Natural Law) 45; Mark Belcher (Ian for King) 23; Karl Fitzhugh (Alfred Chicken) 18; John Walley (Rainbow Alliance) 16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lib Dem Majority: 16,427 (C: 23,105)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

text:  PROPOSALS that could result in local authorities having a free hand in setting pension benefits for their staff are being put forward for consultation following an efficiency scrutiny by the Department of the Environment, published yesterday. The report suggests possible changes to the local government pension scheme in England and Wales, some of which would require legislation. Only new employees would be affected. The proposals range from complete deregulation of pensions, with employers specifically empowered to contribute to private pension plans, to building new flexibilities into the present uniform system. More than Pounds 33bn is invested in the Local Government Superannuation Scheme, more than 10 per cent of the UK pension fund industry. There are more than 2m actual or future beneficiaries - their arrangements are prescribed by the government by regulation. The scheme has traditionally been regarded as providing a 'Rolls-Royce' standard of pension provision, says the report. Many observers believed that the overall package 'probably remains just above average in relation to salary for a pension scheme'. The report says much had changed in recent years in local government - there were fewer employees and more councils were opting out of national pay scales. It adds: 'The local government employment world has thus become more fluid and diverse. Local authority pensions, however, remain monolithic and firmly controlled from the centre.'

text:  MRS DIANA MADDOCK, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Christchurch, yesterday rounded off her by-election victory by returning to the issue that has always led her campaign - the government's proposal to impose value added tax to heating fuel. Speaking in an atmosphere of Liberal Democrat jubilation - albeit tempered by the low-key political style that has marked Mrs Maddock's campaign - she said the people of Christchurch had 'spoken for Britain'. She pledged that VAT would be her first political battle on arrival in Westminster. At her side Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said the by-election had been a 'shout of rage' about the government's policies, and showed that the Liberal Democrats were the main opposition to the government in the south of England. The Liberal Democrats said they had been taken aback by the size of their victory. Mr Ashdown warned: 'It does not mean that we have got them (the voters) for ever. I will not predict general elections from by-elections - it's a mug's game.' On the other side of town disappointed and exhausted Conservative party workers insisted that they would regain the seat at the next election. But Mr Rob Hayward, the Conservative candidate, conceded that the government would have to re-examine some areas of policy if it is to prevent further by-election defeats. Speaking with the self-possession that has been the hallmark of his campaign, he said he had lost 'because the voters of the constituency wanted to register a determined protest'. Away from the television cameras some local Conservatives suggested that Mr Hayward's lack of local roots and the fact he is divorced had weakened him in this highly traditional constituency. His agent, Mrs Judith Jamieson, denied that Mr Hayward was becoming a scapegoat, but admitted that the size of the swing had taken many aback. But in spite of the political tremors that the by-election has sent to Westminster, the mood on the streets of Christchurch yesterday remained  - as always - restrained. A few holidaymakers and shoppers politely applauded Mrs Maddock as she made a triumphant tour in an open-topped bus, surrounded by a thicket of television cameras. But some of Mrs Maddock's constituents warned that she remained on probation. Pensioner Mrs Lily Warner said: 'I voted for her this time because I was fed up. But I don't know what I'll do next time. It all depends on her.'

text:  THE BIG accountancy firms face mounting litigation from creditors and investors seeking to recover losses from insolvent or troubled companies, Lafferty, the business information group, says. Lafferty says in a report to be published next week that the 'threat of litigation has taken on new dimensions' in the US, with accountants held responsible for much more than 'obvious malpractice'. A sharp fall in share prices is sometimes enough to trigger a lawsuit against auditors. In the 1992 financial year spending on litigation of the six leading US accountancy firms amounted to 12 per cent of US accounting and auditing revenues, compared with 9 per cent in 1991. Lafferty says 1992 'will likely go down as the worst year ever for litigation against accountants'. Statistics in the report show that worldwide there have been 12 settlements involving payouts of Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) or more. Four of the cases related to a Dollars 400m settlement by Ernst &amp; Young when it was sued by three US government bodies for its role in the failure of US savings and loans institutions. Ten of these cases were in the US but increasingly the profession is under attack elsewhere in the world. Three of the five lawsuits which sought to recover losses of more than Dollars 1bn have been launched outside the US. These include a claim for Dollars 8bn in damages by the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young. The report says that accountancy firms in at least 50 countries have experienced one or more claims. Firms in at least 20 further countries may have claims pending. Although the level of liability in continental European countries is low, the trend there is rising faster than in any other part of the world. Last year, for example, French accountancy firms faced about 150 cases, twice as many as in 1991. The report says that if all proposed legislation and regulation in the European Community is adopted, accountants practising in member states will be subjected to the harshest rules anywhere that govern claims and liability.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Court to review warehouse finding 
text:  THE COURT of Appeal yesterday allowed the UK's three biggest supermarket chains to continue their attempt to block planning permission for a US-style warehouse club - which would sell goods ranging from baked beans to car tyres - at Thurrock, Essex. Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco appealed after the High Court rejected their application for a judicial review of Thurrock Borough Council's granting of planning permission to Costco, the US warehouse club operator. The High Court must now review the planning consent in early autumn. Costco said it had spent 'several million pounds' on its site next to the Lakeside shopping centre and the warehouse was less than four months from completion. The superstore chains are contesting Thurrock's decision to grant general use approval for Costco's scheme, rather than classify it for retail use. Thurrock says it believes Costco's business plan sets it apart from conventional retailers, and has secured a legally-binding agreement from Costco that it will not depart from that plan. Warehouse clubs sell goods at bargain prices to members who pay an annual fee. Costco said they do not fit into any existing UK planning category. But Mr John Littman, partner at planning consultants Rapleys, which is advising the three superstore chains, said the clubs must be considered as retailers. 'It is essential that warehouse clubs are subject to the same planning controls as other major retailers if the planning system is to operate consistently and effectively in the public interest,' he said. Since the High Court hearing in June the Department of the Environment has published a planning policy guidance note which says that warehouse clubs should be considered retailers for planning purposes. But Thurrock said yesterday it was 'very happy' with its decision. 'We are quite confident the High Court will support our original judgment, because it was based on very sound reasoning,' the council said. Just how seriously the retailers are taking the matter is demonstrated by their unprecedented decision to launch joint legal action. They have appointed a public relations agency to handle the issue. Mr Paul Moulton, managing director of Costco, said he had 'not been in the UK long enough to judge whether the big three are typically this altruistic in their protection of the planning laws. It seems suspicious to me'.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Major sets date to testify at Iraq arms probe: Lord Justice Scott tells Jimmy Burns which present and former ministers he would like to give evidence 
text:  MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is to give evidence in public to the inquiry into arms exports to Iraq on January 17, it was announced yesterday. Mr Major released a copy of a letter sent yesterday in reply to one sent to him on July 14 by Sir Richard Scott, the Appeal Court judge, who is presiding over the inquiry, inviting him to appear as witness in the week beginning December 13. The change of date was agreed to fit in with Mr Major's other December engagements. The prime minister is expected to be questioned about the extent to which he knew about crucial Whitehall decisions relating to arms exports while he was foreign secretary and later as chancellor. In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday - his first since he was chosen to lead the inquiry last December - Sir Richard outlined a list of present and former ministers he wants to give evidence before Christmas. They include: Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister; former foreign office ministers Mr Timothy Renton, Lord Howe, Mr William Waldegrave, Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr David Mellor and Mr Tristan Garel-Jones; former trade ministers Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Alan Clark; and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The judge has not ruled out taking evidence from two former heads of the Ministry of Defence's defence exports sales organisation - Sir James Blyth, now chief executive of Boots, and Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers. He is yet to take a decision on Sir John Cuckney, who was chairman of International Military Services, the government-owned defence sales company, between 1974-85. Sir Richard has asked for additional documents - believed to include CIA material - from the Gonzalez Congressional banking committee in the US, which has been looking at the financing of an alleged covert Iraqi procurement network in the 1980s. Sir Richard said the inquiry had taken longer than he had expected and described it as looking 'into a very murky and inaccurate crystal ball'  - the world of arms trading and the machinery of Whitehall. He now planned to have his report completed by the end of March, not by Christmas as originally thought. In his letter to Mr Major, Sir Richard said delays in obtaining some government documents had 'hindered the efficiency of the questioning of witnesses'. But he emphasised: 'I have not had any impression of any deliberate attempts to withhold information, no civil servants or ministers have dragged their feet about appearing as witnesses. 'As to the answering of questions by witnesses, some witnesses have been forthcoming and extrovert in the way they answer questions and some have not. One knows that as a judge from witness-box appearances. At the end of the day, one has to consider the evidence as a whole and make one's mind up as to what to make of it.' Sir Richard will use the inquiry's summer recess to begin writing his introduction to the report and to sift through additional documents. He said it was too early to be drawn on the report's conclusions and warned against exaggerated expectations concerning its potential political fall-out. 'I do not see myself as holding a gun pointing at the heart of government.' Sir Richard said he did not think his terms of reference include proposals for anti-secrecy laws such as a freedom of information act or rules on public immunity certificates, which are used by the government to restrict access to confidential documents. 'I find it quite unlikely that I am going to be recommending any sort of legislation on (public immunity) . . . because I think it is essentially the sort of area that ought to be left to be developed flexibly,' he said. But he indicated that the evidence he had heard pointed to the need for reform of exports and licensing procedures and a conclusion which could act as an incentive for ministers and civil servants to govern more openly in future. One of the main reasons for the delay in the inquiry's proceedings had been his discovery that companies may have been been getting round legal restrictions on arms exports to Iraq by obtaining 'open licences' to export to other Middle East countries such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, which are not subject to the stricter licensing regime and can be used as diversionary routes. He was only now beginning to get the documentation on open licensing contracts from government departments. 'I do not know how far the implications of this extend, but this is plainly an area which could quite possibly have been used for a number of exports to Iraq, without any breach of statutory export regulations.' Sir Richard rejected the argument that his report should not consider matters of ethics and public accountability in the government's handling of its export policy to Iraq. 'I think government should be prepared to share with the public, on whose behalf they govern, its concerns and aims and the reasons why important decisions are taken. 'I know, that in many cases that is not practical for reasons of security and other overriding national interest that may from time to time arise, but as a general proposition, I do not think that government (policy), on behalf of the public, that is kept from the public, is to be recommended.' Sir Richard said he had been 'persuaded' by MI5 and MI6 that it would be wrong to identify intelligence officers who had appeared as witnesses in private or reveal the content of their evidence in his report where it related to their operations. Additional intelligence information made available to the judge includes that on the Iraqi supergun project. 'I think the personal safety of some of the witnesses would be put at risk (if they were identified) and that is not a risk I am prepared at any degree to run. If you are going to have intelligence agencies and secret services, they had better be kept secret. Otherwise there is no point in having them at all.' Even so he said the government had 'certainly shown itself to be over-secretive in the handling of documents' - a reference to last year's Matrix Churchill trial in which the government's had tried to keep classified documents from defence counsel. 'All the documents which have come to us have various differing degrees of confidentiality or secrecy, according to government criteria. I do not regard myself bound by any of these criteria. I have said that to government and I think they accept that position.' He said he no reason to doubt the government's pledge that the report would be published as written by him and without any 'cuts' by government departments. What will not be made available to the public will be an appendix of evidence gathered from intelligence agents. Sir Richard rejected criticism of the inquiry's cost - 'a good deal cheaper than a court case' - and dismissed suggestions that it involved time-wasting: itably involves the time and co-operation' of Whitehall. Sir Richard said: 'The reason the inquiry was set up in the first place was because of a serious degree of public disquiet over what had been happening in government in connection with arms to Iraq. If the inquiry is going to serve its proper function, I think it is necessary that the nettle is grasped and that the maximum part is held in public.' He added: 'If you are going to have an inquiry, you had better have a thorough one and put up with the price that has to be paid for that thoroughness.'

text:  WHITEHALL INSIDERS are expressing unease about Sir Richard Scott's 'grand inquisitor' role and the way he is conducting his inquiry. Officials at the Foreign Office - subjected to particular scrutiny in recent hearings - say they are 'relaxed' about the inquiry's potential political impact, and hope some of its recommendations may lead to improvements in the efficiency of the government machinery. But they say that in his questioning of witnesses the judge has demonstrated a lack of administrative experience and appreciation of the complexity of Whitehall. One former member of Baroness Thatcher's government said this week: 'The kind of area the judge has been probing is quite absurd. There are meetings every week at the Department of Trade and Industry between officials and companies wanting to sell arms with the Foreign Office waiting in the wings. The companies win a few, they lose a few. It's nothing. 'I've been involved in keeping things from the press but I regard that as a public service, as a patriotic duty. If we had to explain ourselves every time we made a foreign-policy decision there wouldn't be any government.' Officials say the demands on government departments to produce documentary evidence are 'vastly expensive' and waste time which could be used on matters of policy. Whitehall departments are having to devote one and sometimes two officials to dealing with the judge's requests on a full-time basis. 'This is not what we are here for,' said one Whitehall insider. Another widely shared complaint is that the line of questioning by the judge and his team does not appear to take into account the political priorities of the mid 1980s, as opposed to those that prevailed in the aftermath of Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and the ensuing war. 'At the time we were trying to do our best to sell arms,' recalled one official. 'There were rumours that Kurdish villages were being destroyed by the Iraqis, but these were dismissed by our embassy in Baghdad at the time.' One former aide to Lady Thatcher said the former prime minister, who will give evidence later in the year, was 'unrepentant' about her government's conduct of arms policy during the 1980s and was preparing a vigorous defence on com-mercial and pragmatic diplomatic grounds. 'What we were doing was nothing compared to what the French and the Germans were doing, ' he said, adding that in the tortured world of Middle East politics, policy was having to be constantly fine-tuned to deal with changing circumstances. Other foreign observers remember that in September 1988, Sir Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, Lady Thatcher's foreign secretary, said that the evidence of chemical weapons being used by the Iraqis against Kurdish civilians was 'compelling' The judge's terms of reference require him to consider not whether the government was trying to sell arms to Iraq - which it clearly was - but whether in so doing it was in breach of the law and its own declared guidelines.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / ITC may face court challenge from ITV 
text:  SENIOR ITV executives want the powers and responsibilities of the Independent Television Commission to be tested in court after the row over the timing of News at Ten. The ITC and the ITV companies have sharply different legal opinions on the issue of the main news bulletin. A judicial review in the High Court is seen as the only way of deciding which opinion is correct and whether the ITC has the power to insist that the programme should run at a particular time. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London Weekend Television, believes the issue is much wider than News at Ten. He believes that the 1990 Broadcasting Act is ambiguous on the respective powers and responsibilities of the ITC and the ITV companies. Apart from timing, he would like a ruling on ITV's obligation to provide a diverse schedule. One possibility to be discussed would involve persuading the ITC to acquiesce in an ITV application for a judicial review to clarify the issue. Meanwhile opposition is growing to any relaxation of the rules preventing the nine largest ITV companies taking over each other. The Glasgow-based Daily Record newspaper has published a letter from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, in which Mr Lang expresses concern about the implications of such a relaxation for Scotland. Regional programme-making obligations might still be enforced but there was no protection for network programme production in the event of a takeover. Mr Lang argues for stricter rules so that, at least in Scotland, ITV companies cannot take over neighbours in order to protect their separate identities. Even supporters of the relaxation of takeover rules believe this is now less likely.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Mail group to spend Pounds 20m on tabloid supplements 
text:  ASSOCIATED Newspapers is launching new tabloid supplements for its three main titles the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard in London. Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, said the initiative, which will cost about Pounds 20m in its first year, would be partly paid for by cost-cutting and a significant reduction in the group's television advertising, which totalled more than Pounds 11m last year. The new supplements, with 48 pages and full colour, represent a departure for the middle market and are likely to intensify competition when they are launched in October. The Daily Mail supplement will accompany the Saturday edition. It will be aimed at the family and include seven days of television listings. The new Mail on Sunday section will feature reviews and have longer pieces of what Mr Hardy called 'reportage', aiming to increase the paper's appeal to broadsheet readers. The Evening Standard's supplement will be published on Friday and include the week's television listings. Mr Hardy said that five years ago the Daily Mail had an average of 40 pages with an advertising ratio of 38 per cent. Now the paper has an average of 64 pages with 32 per cent advertising. He added: 'We have also hardened the advertising rates which is an enormous achievement during the recession.' During the same five-year period the Daily Mail's circulation has marginally increased. In January 1989 it was 1.7366m and in June 1993, the latest official figures, it was 1.7455m. Average circulation for the Mail on Sunday between January and March 1989 was 1.977m, and from March to June this year the figure was 1.985m. Immediate rivals such as the Daily Express and Sunday Express lost circulation during this period.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Ending of car prefix system urged 
text:  MOTOR INDUSTRY analysts believe up to 410,000 cars will be registered in August, the fourth-highest volume for a single month in the industry's history. But nearly two thirds of car dealers want to discontinue the yearly registration prefix - L this year - which causes the sales bulge, a survey by Automotive Management, a motor industry management publication, and Esso, the oil group, has found. The prefix system was criticised yesterday by Professor Garel Rhys, who holds the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chair in motor-industry economics at Cardiff Business School, and is industry adviser to the Commons trade and industry committee. Prof Rhys warned that the system conflicted with the 'lean' manufacturing and distribution practices which the industry needed to remain competitive, since it required manufacturers and dealers to build up stocks in advance of August 1, the day the registration prefix changed. He said: 'The only party now benefiting from the system are Continental manufacturers, for whom the UK August bulge is a godsend when demand in their own markets has gone seasonally flat.' The police favour the prefix system, saying it helps witnesses remember cars used in crime. Nearly 700 dealers took part in the survey, which found that 62 per cent want to abandon the system and 24 per cent favour it. The Retail Motor Industry Federation, which represents most dealers, is critical of the system. The survey did not consider possible alternatives. The August 'bulge' - which reached a high point of 500,000 in 1989 - has sometimes threatened to overwhelm the trade. A government inquiry into the prefix system towards the end of the 1980s was abandoned when changes could not be agreed. The yearly identifier letter should be abandoned, Prof Rhys said, allowing the market to readjust to seasonal peaks. He added: 'If August goes as expected, it will mean that 23 per cent of the year's sales will have been made in one month. Even the Japanese could not run an inventory-less system with that kind of distortion.'

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / Strength of retail recovery doubted 
text:  THE RECOVERY in consumer confidence and retail sales may be weaker than suggested by government statistics, according to a survey carried out by NOP for Verdict, the retail market research group. Each month NOP asks 2,000 adults throughout the UK whether they are seriously considering purchasing nine items - ranging from Pounds 100-worth of clothes to a house or flat - in the next six months. It adds the percentage of positive responses in each category together to form a purchasing intentions index. Verdict's index for July is 112, unchanged from June. The figures for the last two months are the lowest this year - after the index reached 125 in May, 117 in April and 126 in March - and are only slightly above the 110 recorded in July last year. Verdict said: 'These data are forward-looking, so that one cannot expect the figures to correlate precisely with current retail sales. But since we began the series these data have proved to be an excellent barometer of trends, and we remain convinced that official data are running seriously ahead of reality.' Verdict said it remained 'agnostic' about official statistics showing an inflation-adjusted increase in retail sales of almost 4 per cent year-on-year. For this increase to be true, it said, retail multiples would have to be experiencing growth of about 6 per cent and independent retailers about 3 per cent. The group said: 'Such levels of growth are not being achieved by the multiples with whom we are in touch.' Its own analysis suggests year-on-year growth across all sectors is about 2 per cent.

text:  FRIENDS OF Mr Asil Nadir were yesterday ordered to surrender Pounds 1.15m they promised as bail surety for the fugitive tycoon. The money was part of a record Pounds 3.5m bail which Mr Nadir skipped in May when he escaped to northern Cyprus rather than face charges of false accounting and theft. Mr Ramadan Guney, the businessman who promised a Pounds 1m bail surety for Mr Nadir, was yesterday ordered to forfeit Pounds 650,000. Mr Guney appeared in court after the case had earlier been deferred on the grounds of his ill-health. At the Old Bailey Mr Justice Tucker gave Mr Guney six months to pay and imposed a sentence of two years' imprisonment if he defaulted. Mr Nadir's ex-wife, Mrs Aysegul Nadir, had promised Pounds 500,000 surety. Mr Justice Tucker ordered that she pay that sum to the court within 28 days or go to prison for 18 months. However, he expressed doubt that she would pay since she was reported to be in northern Cyprus. The judge said he was satisfied that Mr Guney had played no part in Mr Nadir's flight nor aided his escape but he had not taken all reasonable steps to ensure Mr Nadir appeared for trial. Mr Guney said he would appeal. 'As far as I can see there is no justice.' Mr Rick Shearman, Mr Guney's solicitor, said the substance of his client's case, which the judge heard in private, was that the surety had not been renewed in June last year when Mr Nadir first appeared in court. Mr Nadir's bail was comprised of both securities, where the money is deposited, and sureties, where the money is pledged but not handed over. A total of Pounds 2m was deposited with Mr Nadir's solicitors as security for his appearance at court. Ownership of this money is now disputed and is the subject of a further civil court hearing on August 18.

text:  NATIONAL Westminster Bank, Hambros Bank, and BZW, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, yesterday won a High Court ruling overturning an Inland Revenue decision that two Pounds 25m loan-back business expansion schemes affecting 3,000 investors did not qualify for tax relief. BES schemes give tax relief to investors at their highest marginal rate if they hold their investment for five years. In his March Budget Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, abolished loan-back BES schemes, which allowed investors to withdraw after six months while retaining full BES tax relief at their top marginal rate. He ruled that shares in BES companies had to be issued by the midnight before the Budget if loans were to be made against them. BZW's Gracechurch companies and National Westminster's Homeshare scheme  - launched in conjunction with Hambros Bank - had raised their full subscription of Pounds 25m each after launches in February and the first week of March respectively. The banks had allotted shares but had not listed the shareholdings in the companies' register of members by the Budget deadline. In May the Inland Revenue decided the shares had not been 'issued' and would not be eligible for tax relief. But Mr Justice Rattee ruled yesterday that the word 'issue' had no fixed meaning and there was 'no reason to think that the legislature intended the availability of BES tax relief to be dependent on the actual registration of shareholders or the issue of share certificates'. The banks' argument is that shares are issued when shareholders have a right and an obligation to be put on the register of members and that it is not necessary for a shareholder's name to be typed in for it to be registered. They had promised to return to investors their original investment should the legal case fail. Yesterday the Inland Revenue was considering the implications of the decision. It has 28 days to file an appeal. It earlier argued that a ruling in favour of the banks might have wider ramifications.

headline:  FT  31 JUL 93 / EC rules 'do not cover pensions' 
text:  A TEST case at the Employment Appeal Tribunal has established that pensions are not covered by the European Community directive that preserves the rights of employees when businesses change hands or work is contracted out. The case was over the pension rights of Mr Ernest Warrener, whose company changed hands in circumstances that were covered by the EC's Acquired Rights Directive 1977. The tribunal ruled that the new owner was not required to offer the same pension provisions to employees which they had enjoyed under their previous owner. The judgment was described as 'decisive' by Ms Melanie Tether, a partner of City solicitors Norton Rose. She said: 'The tribunal backs the government view that the directive protects only the accumulated rights of employees up to the time an undertaking is transferred.' This will come as a relief to contractors bidding for public-sector contracts, since pension provisions are often much more generous in the public sector. Last night Mr John Hall, director-general of the Cleaning and Support Services Association, said the judgment as 'very useful'. He said: 'It clears the air on one of the major issues hanging over the government's contracting-out programme.' However, a second test case completed yesterday at the tribunal confirmed that the directive can apply to contracting-out of public-sector services. In a judgment over a refuse collection contract in Eastbourne, East Sussex, the tribunal said that the pay and conditions of staff whose jobs are contracted out could be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981, which implemented the directive in UK law. This appears to confirm advice given by the government's law officers in the spring that recent cases in the European Court of Justice have widened the scope of the Tupe regulations to compulsory competitive tendering. Where the regulations apply, they protect the jobs and conditions of employment of the workforce when their jobs are transferred to another employer. However, the Eastbourne judgment was immediately greeted by Mr Jack Dromey of the TGWU general union as 'a historic verdict'. He invited the government to offer compensation to those who had lost their jobs or pay as a result of contracting out. Otherwise they would face thousands of claims for compensation for not properly implementing EC legislation.

Implementation of the directive in the UK through the Tupe regulations has created uncertainty over its application when public services are contracted out. The French government is believed to be concerned about the impact of the directive on its plans to privatise state-owned banks and industries. At Monday's summit meeting, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, agreed to include the directive in 24 items of EC legislation they wish to be reviewed.

text:  A LOBBY group backed by some of Britain's largest companies has lodged a complaint with the European Commission against BAA, alleging anti-competitive practices. It accuses BAA, which operates London's largest airports, of unfairly excluding some business jets so that more commercial aircraft on scheduled flights can use the overcrowded run-ways. Some companies using business aircraft have contacted the office of Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, to argue that business aircraft should continue to have free access to Heathrow. BAA acknowledged that it wants to give more landing slots to bigger aircraft and had cancelled some of the peak-time slots reserved for business aircraft. Private aircraft account for 4 per cent of the traffic at Heathrow. The lobby group intends to take BAA to the European Court in Luxembourg.

text:  BARCLAYS YESTERDAY promised to amend its customer application forms after banks were told that they had to allow customers to choose whether their personal account details can be used by subsidiaries to market products. Barclays, Britain's biggest bank, has required customers applying for new accounts, credit cards or loans to sign forms saying that they consent to account information being given to other companies in the Barclays group. The review committee considering amendments to the voluntary code of banking practice said that it would alter the code from next March to ensure that this approach to consent to the internal use of data for marketing products was barred. The committee warned in its annual report that if customers were asked to agree to their names and addresses being passed to other companies in a banking group they should be 'given a clear option to say no if they wish'. The committee also criticised banks for their 'undesirable coyness' over informing customers about their internal complaints procedures, and for using 'gobbledegook' in contracts setting out conditions of services. The ruling comes after controversy over the ways in which banks have interpreted the code's requirement that customers should give 'express consent' before their account details can be used for purposes such as life insurance selling. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, and Mr Eric Howe, the data-protection registrar, have both expressed concern about apparent efforts by banks, including Barclays and National Westminster, to circumvent this. Sir Bryan recently accused some banks of breaking the 'spirit and perhaps even the letter' of their code. NatWest has assured its life insurance sellers access to the bank's current account data by making them bank employees. Mr Howe said in his annual report this month that the code's benefit was 'clearly negated' if banks refused to allow customers access to services unless they signed forms giving consent for data disclosure in the group. The committee said that 'tacit acquiescence' as a result of customer inertia or 'their understandable failure to read through the fine print to the end will not be regarded as an acceptable form of consent' when the code is amended. The committee, chaired by Sir George Blunden, is reviewing the code after receiving more than 20 submissions from organisations including consumer groups. Barclays said it could not estimate the cost of the change, although it would have to alter application forms. It said it was complying with the code as it stood, but would make any changes necessary to comply with the revised version. The difference in interpretation among banks has caused some tension. Lloyds Bank, which asks all customers to sign consent forms, said in its submission that the definition of express consent should be standardised.
