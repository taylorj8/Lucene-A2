text:   SUMMARY:     The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations for the medical use of byproduct material. This action is being taken in response to a petition for rulemaking. This final rule is intended to provide greater flexibility by allowing properly qualified nuclear pharmacists and authorized users who are physicians greater discretion to prepare radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for medical use. This final rule, while allowing research involving human subjects using byproduct material, requires NRC licensees who conduct such research to obtain the informed consent of the human subjects and the prior review and approval of an ``institutional review board'' within the meaning of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. This final rule also allows medical use of radiolabeled biologics. In addition, this final rule contains other miscellaneous and conforming amendments necessary to clarify or update the current regulations.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         I. Background         The Petition for Rulemaking         In early 1989, the American College of Nuclear Physicians (ACNP) and the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) approached the NRC staff with concerns that the Commission's regulations failed to accommodate the functions and responsibilities of the practice of nuclear pharmacy. At the suggestion of the NRC staff, the ACNP and SNM submitted a petition for rulemaking requesting the Commission to amend its regulations to fully recognize the role of licensed nuclear pharmacists and physicians. On September 15, 1989 (54 FR 38239), the Commission published in the     Federal Register     a notice of receipt of a petition for rulemaking for public comment (PRM&hyph;35&hyph;9).     During the development of the ACNP-SNM petition, one NRC staff member provided substantial assistance in the preparation of the petition. However, that individual has not participated in the NRC's resolution of the petition or in the development of this rule. Another NRC staff member reviewed the petition prior to its formal submittal to the Commission and participated, to some extent, in the NRC's resolution of the petition and in the development of the rule. The Commission, while aware of this background, considered the petition on its own merits.     The petition included the following requests:     A. The petitioners requested that authorized users who are physicians (physician authorized users) be given greater flexibility regarding the medical use of radiopharmaceuticals containing byproduct material. Specifically, the petitioners requested that these physicians be permitted to: (1) Use radiopharmaceuticals to treat diseases that are not listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved package insert; (2) Use methods of administration of radiopharmaceuticals that are not listed in the package insert; (3) Use radiopharmaceuticals other than those for which the FDA has accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) or an approved New Drug Application (NDA); (4) Prepare radiopharmaceuticals using radionuclide generators and reagent kits in a manner other than in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; and (5) Compound radiopharmaceuticals in accordance with State law.

Background         The Petition for Rulemaking         In early 1989, the American College of Nuclear Physicians (ACNP) and the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) approached the NRC staff with concerns that the Commission's regulations failed to accommodate the functions and responsibilities of the practice of nuclear pharmacy.

Specifically, the petitioners requested that nuclear pharmacists be permitted to: (1) Compound radiopharmaceuticals as allowed by State or FDA regulations; (2) Compound radiopharmaceuticals whose manufacture and distribution are not regulated by the State or FDA; (3) Prepare radiopharmaceuticals using radionuclide generators and reagent kits in a manner other than in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; (4) Produce reagent kits; and (5) Dispense radiopharmaceuticals that are not regulated by the FDA.     C. Additionally, the petitioners requested that the NRC: (1) Permit categories of research using radioactive drugs that do not require an IND, such as research approved by a Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC); (2) Permit the use of radiolabeled biologics for which the FDA has issued a license in response to a product license application (PLA); and (3) Clarify its regulations pertaining to specific licenses of broad scope.         Earlier NRC Efforts         In response to the     Federal Register     notice that announced the receipt of the petition, 466 comment letters were received. About 99 percent of the commenters supported and agreed with the petition. After consideration of the public comment letters and consultation with the FDA staff, the Commission determined that some issues should be addressed promptly.     On August 23, 1990 (55 FR 34513), the Commission published an Interim Final Rule to allow, for a period of 3 years, the use of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for indications not listed in the package insert and to allow departures from the manufacturer's instructions for preparing diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals using radionuclide generators and reagent kits. On July 22, 1993, the Commission extended the expiration date of the Interim Final Rule from August 23, 1993, to December 31, 1994. The action allows licensees to continue to use byproduct material under the provisions of the Interim Final Rule until the Commission completes this final rule.     In a parallel effort, the NRC continued to work on the remaining issues in the ACNP&hyph;SNM petition. On August 7, 1991, the NRC conducted a public workshop in Rosemont, Illinois, to present ``strawman'' language on the training and experience criteria for authorized nuclear pharmacists to representatives of the following organizations: Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties, American Board of Science in Nuclear Medicine, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, Committee on Radionuclides and Radiopharmaceuticals of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, American Pharmaceutical Association, American Society of Hospital Pharmacists, and three graduate schools of pharmacy. Subsequently, the NRC also discussed the proposed resolution of these issues in meetings with the FDA, the NRC's Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes (ACMUI), and the Agreement States. This rulemaking is the evolutionary result of numerous meetings with the aforementioned groups.         NRC's Policy         In a policy statement published on February 9, 1979 (44 FR 8242), entitled ``Regulation of the Medical Uses of Radioisotopes; Statement of General Policy,'' the NRC stated:     1. The NRC will continue to regulate the medical uses of radioisotopes as necessary to provide for the radiation safety of workers and the general public.

The NRC will regulate the radiation safety of patients where justified by the risk to patients and where voluntary standards, or compliance with these standards, are inadequate.   3. The NRC will minimize intrusion into medical judgments affecting patients and into other areas traditionally considered to be a part of the practice of medicine.   In conformance with this policy, the Commission is eliminating certain restrictions in the NRC regulations on the practices of medicine and pharmacy (e.g., compounding), and is providing the authority for research involving human subjects and the use of radiolabeled biologics. The Commission believes that these restrictions can be eliminated without compromising the level of protection of public health and safety against radiological hazards. The Commission recognizes that physicians have the primary responsibility for the diagnosis and treatment of their patients or human research subjects and recognizes that nuclear pharmacists have the primary responsibility for the preparation of radioactive drugs. NRC regulations are predicated on the assumption that properly trained and adequately informed physicians and pharmacists will make decisions that are in the best interest of their patients or human research subjects. Furthermore, the pharmacological aspects of radioactive drugs, including drug safety and efficacy, are regulated by the FDA or the States.       II. The Proposed Rule, Public Comments, and NRC Responses      The Commission published the proposed rule in the     Federal Register     on June 17, 1993 (58 FR 33396), and provided a 120-day public comment period. About 2,500 copies of the notice of the proposed rulemaking were mailed to all applicable NRC licensees, Agreement State and Non-Agreement State agencies, and other interested groups.   The NRC received 284 comment letters in response to the proposed rule. There were 280 letters in support of the proposed rule, 1 letter in opposition to the proposed rule, and 3 letters provided comments without specifically indicating support for or opposition to the proposed rule. There were 182 letters from individuals working in commercial pharmacies, 3 from pharmaceutical manufacturers, 6 from hospitals, 7 from professional associations, 6 from universities, 5 from governmental agencies, and 75 who did not indicate their affiliations. In terms of commenters' professions or qualifications, the vast majority of letters were from pharmacists.   Public comments and the NRC's responses are presented below. General comments are presented first, followed by specific comments associated with individual sections of the rule for which comments were received. The discussion of the changes in the proposed rule language is presented in section III entitled ``Discussion of Final Rule Text.'' Referring to section V, entitled ``Text of Final Regulations,'' may expedite the reader's understanding of the public comments and the NRC's responses.       General Comments       (1)     Comment.     The NRC is ``straying very far'' from its mandate and competence in regulating the medical uses of byproduct material. The commenter appended a copy of section 104 of the Atomic Energy Act, entitled ``Medical Therapy and Research and Development,'' as rationale for the commenter's viewpoint.

text: nullnull          Response.     The Commission's statutory mandate in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, includes all uses of byproduct, source, and special nuclear material. Specifically, section 81 of the Act     prohibits,     without Commission authorization, the manufacture, production, transfer, receipt in interstate commerce, acquisition, ownership, possession, import, or export of byproduct material (42 U.S.C. 2111). Also, section 161 of the Act states (in part):          The Commission is authorized to establish by rule, regulation, or order, such standards and instructions to govern the possession and use of special nuclear material, source material, and     byproduct material     as the Commission may deem necessary or desirable to promote the common defense and security or to protect health or to minimize danger to life or property (emphasis added).          Therefore, the Commission has broad statutory responsibility to regulate all uses of byproduct material, including medical use.       Section 104(a) of the Atomic Energy Act states:          The Commission is authorized to issue licenses to persons applying therefor     for utilization facilities for use in medical therapy.     In issuing such licenses the Commission is directed to permit the widest amount of effective medical therapy possible with the amount of     special nuclear material     available for such purpose and to impose the minimum amount of regulation consistent with its obligations under this Act to promote the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public (42 U.S.C. 2134(a)) (emphasis added).          Section 104(a) on its face applies only to medical therapy licensees for using ``utilization facilities'' (i.e., nuclear reactors) and ``special nuclear material.'' No ``minimum regulation'' directive governs the Commission's regulation of byproduct material. This section does not even apply to the medical use of byproduct material, which falls within the NRC's broad standard-setting authority in sections 81 and 161 of the Act. Even if the commenter were correct that the NRC had a statutory obligation to minimize regulation, this rule eliminates certain restrictions in the regulation of the medical use of byproduct material, furthering that purpose. The Commission is, in fact, imposing the minimum amount of regulation commensurate with the need for protection of the public health and safety.   Regarding the NRC's competence, ``[t]he substantive area in which an agency is deemed to be expert is determined by statute.''     Massachusetts     v.     United States,     856 F.2d 378, 382 (1st Cir. 1988).     See also Commonwealth of Massachusetts     v.     NRC,     924 F.2d 311, 324 (D.C. Cir.),     cert. denied,     112 S.Ct. 275 (1991). The Atomic Energy Act commits to the NRC the duty of regulating the use of byproduct materials, including radioactive drugs, to protect public health and safety and as a matter of law the NRC is deemed ``expert'' in making technical and policy judgements in this field.   The NRC has long experience in regulating nuclear medicine and ``[i]n recent years has increased its recruitment of personnel who have experience and knowledge either in nuclear medicine or in radiation therapy'' (56 FR 34104; July 25, 1991). Since the Commission's inception, it has been accountable for the regulation of medical uses of byproduct material. It has licensed, inspected, collected and analyzed data in this field for many years, and has issued and administered various forms of regulations.   Furthermore, this rulemaking is not about what dosage of a radioactive drug should be prescribed to treat or diagnose a patient. It is about the qualifications of individuals performing NRC-licensed activities (e.g., authorized nuclear pharmacists) that are necessary to protect the health and safety of patients and workers from radiological hazards. This rule, in other words, does not intrude on medical judgment. Moreover, the NRC has highly qualified staff and extensive experience in determining radiation safety qualifications.   In addition, the NRC has an advisory committee (the Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes or ``ACMUI''), which, since its establishment many years ago, has advised the NRC on rulemakings and other initiatives related to the medical uses of byproduct material. The membership of the ACMUI includes a broad spectrum of expertise, such as physicians (i.e., in nuclear medicine, cardiology, and radiation oncology), medical physicists, pharmacists, medical researchers, practicing technologists, hospital administrators, state medical regulators, Food and Drug Administration representatives, and a patient rights representative. The NRC also has a visiting medical fellows program that allows selected physicians or pharmacists to work for NRC for a period of 1 to 2 years. Both ACMUI and the visiting medical fellows provided advice to the NRC during the development of this rule.   (2)     Comment.     The NRC is attempting to duplicate regulation by other federal, state, and national entities which already have appropriate responsibility in the areas of medicine and pharmacy.       Response.     This final rule is not duplicating regulation by other federal or state agencies. In fact, this rule is designed to avoid duplication of the regulations of other federal agencies (e.g., see response to comments on &sect;35.6). In the area of medical use of byproduct material, the NRC and FDA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (58 FR 47300; September 8, 1993) to coordinate existing NRC and FDA regulatory programs. Generally speaking, FDA regulates the manufacture and distribution of radioactive drugs and medical devices for safety and efficacy, while the NRC regulates radiation safety associated with the actual use of these products.

text: nullnull      (3)     Comment.     The preamble to the proposed rule gives the impression that the NRC would allow nuclear physicians and nuclear pharmacists to use unregulated, dangerous radioactive drugs. In addition, a commenter stated that, under State Pharmacy law, a licensed pharmacist may delegate certain duties to non-pharmacist individuals if the pharmacist provides ``direct supervision.'' Is it the NRC's intent to permit the authorized nuclear pharmacist to delegate the full range of professional duties to non-pharmacist individuals?        Response.     The preamble to the proposed rule stated that a licensee must meet the Commission's regulations regarding radiation safety of the workers and the public, including patients, and that the licensee is not relieved from complying with applicable FDA, other Federal, and State requirements governing radioactive drugs. Because the FDA and States regulate the safety and efficacy of radioactive drugs, the licensee must also follow their regulations when using radioactive drugs. The Commission will allow an authorized nuclear pharmacist to delegate a full range of duties to a non-pharmacist individual provided that the individual is properly supervised (i.e., according to &sect;35.25).     (4)     Comment.     The final rule should be effective immediately upon publication in the     Federal Register     instead of being effective 6 months after publication.         Response.     The Commission agrees that licensees may not need 6 months to implement this final rule. However, with limited exceptions, section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides that ``[t]he required publication or service of a substantive rule shall be made not less than 30 days before its effective date.'' The commenter has not persuaded the NRC that good cause exists for making immediately effective this final rule, which in part, imposes new substantive requirements. Therefore, the effective date will be 30 days after publication of this rule in the     Federal Register    .     (5)     Comment.     The NRC should provide a mechanism for ``grandfathering'' qualified nuclear pharmacists who are currently working in hospital-based nuclear pharmacies, similar to the mechanism proposed for ``grandfathering'' qualified individuals working in commercial nuclear pharmacies.         Response.     The Commission agrees with this comment because a qualified nuclear pharmacist should be ``grandfathered'' regardless of whether the individual is currently working in a commercial nuclear pharmacy or a hospital-based nuclear pharmacy. Therefore, &sect;35.981 entitled ``Training for experienced nuclear pharmacists,'' has been added to this final rule. This section is similar to &sect;32.72 in the proposed rule for ``grandfathering'' qualified individuals working in commercial nuclear pharmacies. The Commission believes that this limited ``grandfathering'' is justified provided: (1) This individual is currently working in a nuclear pharmacy; (2) this individual has completed a structured educational program as specified in &sect;35.980(b)(1); and (3) the qualifications of this individual would be reviewed and approved by NRC before a licensee may allow this individual to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist.     (6)     Comment.     Several commenters requested that the following items be addressed in this rulemaking: (a) Handling of brachytherapy radioactive sources for temporary implants related to I&hyph;125 eye plaques, wherein the patient goes home and returns several days later for removal of the sources; (b) Changing the person who signs the records of sealed source leak tests, sealed source inventories, and surveys of sealed source storage areas from the Radiation Safety Officer to the individual who performs these tasks; and (c) Permitting licensees to allow Radiation Safety Officers who meet certain requirements to work without first obtaining a license amendment (similar to the provisions proposed for authorized users and authorized nuclear pharmacists).         Response.     These items will not be addressed because they are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.         Specific Comments         Section 32.72&blank;Manufacture, Preparation, or Transfer for Commercial Distribution of Radioactive Drugs Containing Byproduct Material for Medical Use Under 10 CFR Part 35        Several commenters addressed the use of the term ``radioactive drug.'' These comments and the NRC's responses are summarized below.     (1)     Comment.     One commenter stated that ``the FDA has a specific definition which it uses for radiopharmaceuticals, and I am not aware that it will similarly replace this word with that of radioactive drug.'' Also, the commenter questioned whether the term ``radioactive drug'' included radiolabeled biologics.         Response.     FDA regulations define the term ``radioactive drug'' (21 CFR 310.3) but do not define the term ``radiopharmaceutical.'' As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the term ``radioactive drug'' includes a radiolabeled biologic, which is an accurate usage for both NRC and FDA regulations.       (2)     Comment.     The medical use of byproduct material may be approved by the FDA as a radioactive drug or a device. If it is approved as a device, not a radioactive drug, would the proposed changes create regulatory barriers in such situations?         Response.     This rule does not impose any new regulatory requirements for the use of devices containing byproduct material. Therefore, this rule would not create regulatory barriers for the use of such devices.         Section 32.72(a)(2)        Several commenters requested clarification concerning the proposed requirement that a nuclear pharmacy or a drug manufacturer must obtain a Part 32 license. These comments and the NRC's responses are summarized below.     (1)     Comment.     The NRC should continue to permit Part 33 or 35 medical use licensees to share a nuclear pharmacy without requiring a Part 32 license.         Response.     The Commission currently permits the nuclear pharmacy of a Part 33 or 35 medical use licensee to distribute radioactive drugs to a limited set of medical use licensees through a license amendment approval on a case-by-case basis. This is the context in which such licensees may ``share'' a nuclear pharmacy. The Commission believes that Part 33 or 35 licensees who have been granted this authority could continue to operate a nuclear pharmacy provided that the nuclear pharmacy:

text: nullnull      (i) Complies with the safety requirements specified in 10 CFR 32.72(a)(3), (a)(4), and (c);     (ii) Is operated by a medical use licensee; and     (iii) Only engages in limited distribution to a specified set of medical use licensees but does not engage in commercial distribution.     Other Part 33 or 35 medical use licensees seeking this authority must first apply for a license amendment and receive an authorization for limited distribution pursuant to Part 32. The fees specified in Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31 and 10 CFR 171.16 are assessed for this type of authorization. As provided in footnote 1(d)(2) of 10 CFR 170.31, there is an application fee (fee Category 3C) to add this type of authorization. Upon issuance of the license amendment adding this authorization, the licensee will be subject to the licensing and inspection fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31 and the annual fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 171.16. These fees are in addition to any other fee categories covered by the existing license.     However, in those cases where a small number of Part 35 licensees wish to transfer unsealed byproduct material among themselves, the NRC will consider granting an exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 35.19. 10 CFR 170.31 (footnote 2) specifies the fees for such exemption requests. For existing Part 35 licensees, requests for an exemption under 10 CFR 35.19 are subject to the amendment fees specified in 10 CFR 170.31, or fee Category 7B or 7C, as applicable.     (2)     Comment.     The NRC should continue to permit Part 33 licensees who are authorized to produce radioactive drugs to be used only for research experiments to distribute these drugs to medical use licensees.         Response.     The Commission currently permits such a Part 33 licensee to distribute, on a limited basis, radioactive drugs to be used only for research experiments through a license amendment approval on a case-by-case basis. The Commission believes that Part 33 licensees who have been granted this authority could continue to distribute these drugs provided that the Part 33 licensee complies with safety requirements specified in 10 CFR 32.72(a)(3), (a)(4), and (c). Other Part 33 licensees seeking this authority must first apply for a license amendment and receive an authorization for limited distribution pursuant to Part 32. This type of authorization is subject to the fees specified in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31 and 171.16. As provided in footnote 1(d)(2) of 10 CFR 170.31, there is an application fee (fee Category 3C) to add this type of authorization. Upon issuance of the license amendment adding this authorization, the licensee will be assessed the licensing and inspection fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31 and the annual fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 171.16. These fees are in addition to any other fee categories covered by the existing license.         Section 32.72(a)(4).         There were numerous comments addressing the labeling requirements. These comments and NRC's responses are summarized below.     (1)     Comment.     Several commenters stated that the NRC has no legal jurisdiction over drug labeling and should not require drug labeling because it is regulated by the FDA. Another commenter supported the proposed labeling requirements and stated that its facility has already included all information specified in the proposed rule.         Response.     The Commission has broad authority under sections 81 and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, including authority to establish by rule, regulation, or order, such standards and instructions to govern the possession and use of byproduct material. Therefore, the Commission has jurisdiction to require labeling of radioactive drugs containing byproduct material and is currently requiring that specific information be included on labels.     The Commission's labeling requirements are not intended to duplicate FDA requirements, but are intended to provide information related to radiation safety. These labels are needed for:     (i) Hospital workers to ensure that the radioactive drug is the correct drug and the correct dosage; and     (ii) Transport workers to identify the contents of a vial, container, or package, and to take appropriate actions in the event of any transportation accident.     (2)     Comment.     It would be very costly to have inspectors check 12 million drug labels. The commenter believes that this activity would be entirely cost-ineffective.         Response.     The modifications to current &sect;32.72(a)(4) are intended to clarify the existing labeling requirements, except for the addition of ``time of assay.'' Thus, the Commission believes that licensees will not incur significant additional cost associated with these modifications. In terms of inspections, the NRC inspectors do not check the label of every container or package of a radioactive drug. They may conduct spot checks. Thus, there will not be a significant cost for NRC inspectors either.

text: nullnull      (3)     Comment    . The syringe label should not be limited to the clinical procedure. On the other hand, it is unnecessary to require that the label, or the leaflet or brochure that accompanies the radioactive drug, contain all of the statements specified in the proposed rule.         Response    . The regulatory text in this section states: ``In addition, the label for the syringe or syringe radiation shield must also contain the clinical procedure to be performed or the patient's or the human research subject's name.'' Thus, the clinical procedure is an additional item but not the only item on the label.     Regarding the statements that must be included in the leaflet or brochure, the Commission believes these statements are necessary because they serve as warnings to individuals who are not authorized to use the byproduct material. However, the statement that ``other regulatory approvals may be required'' has been deleted because this concern is already covered by 10 CFR 35.7.     (4)     Comment    . It is unclear as to the legal origin of the statement that ``NRC's labeling requirements are independent of requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).''         Response    . This comment quotes the last sentence of &sect;32.72(a)(4) of the proposed rule, stating that: ``NRC's labeling requirements are independent of requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).'' This comment appears to question the NRC's statutory authority for the quoted statement. As previously stated in response to comment 1 on &sect;32.72(a)(4), the NRC's statutory authority to impose requirements with respect to the labeling of radioactive drugs containing byproduct material derives from its authority under the Atomic Energy Act (primarily sections 81 and 161b) to regulate byproduct material. The quoted sentence makes it clear that NRC's labeling requirements are separate from the labeling requirements of FDA.         Section 32.72(b)        There were several comments concerning this paragraph. These comments and the NRC's responses are discussed below.     (1)     Comment    . The phrase ``within 30 days of the date'' used in the proposed &sect;32.72(b)(3) is confusing and should be replaced with ``no later than 30 days after the date.''         Response    . The Commission agrees with the comment. The final rule text has been modified accordingly.     (2)     Comment    . In the preamble of the proposed rule discussing proposed &sect;32.72(b)(3), the use of the phrase ``individual's character'' in determining whether the individual should be approved as an authorized nuclear pharmacist appears inappropriate.         Response    . The NRC disagrees with this comment. Under sections 182 and 183 of the Atomic Energy Act, the Commission has broad authority over the scope of license applications and the terms of licenses. Section 182(a) includes the authority to require, by rule or regulation, such information as the Commission determines necessary to decide, among other things, the technical     and other     qualifications of the applicant as the Commission may deem appropriate, as well as the applicant's character. Therefore, in determining whether to grant a license or license amendment, or approve an individual to perform licensed activities, the NRC can consider the past performance and character (which may include activities involving improper or illegal practices) of the license applicant, the licensee, or the individual who is to perform licensed activities. An individual occupying the position of a physician authorized user or authorized nuclear pharmacist has the potential to affect the public health and safety. Accordingly, it would be appropriate for the NRC to consider information relating to that individual's ``character.''     (3)     Comment    . If an authorized nuclear pharmacist decides not to seek recertification as a Board Certified Nuclear Pharmacist, would the individual lose the authorized nuclear pharmacist status?         Response    . No. If an individual gained authorized nuclear pharmacist status based on board certification and decided not to seek recertification, this individual may continue to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist provided this individual continues to be identified as an authorized nuclear pharmacist on a Commission or Agreement State license or on a permit issued by a Commission or Agreement State licensee of broad scope.     (4)     Comment    . Would the scope of ``grandfathering'' extend beyond the initial transition period?         Response    . The Commission believes it is not necessary to limit the ``grandfathering'' provision to a definite period after the effective date of this final rule. Therefore, there is no time limit for the ``grandfathering'' provision.         Section 32.72(c)        There were several comments concerning instrumentation. These comments and the NRC's responses are discussed below.

text: nullnull      (1)     Comment.     The proposed requirements for linearity and geometry tests are not consistent with methods of assaying alpha or beta emitters, such as liquid scintillation counting.       Response.     The regulatory text includes the phrase ``as appropriate for the use of the instrument.'' Therefore, if linearity or geometry tests are not appropriate for an instrument, the tests are not required.     (2)     Comment.     The regulation does not require medical use licensees to measure the activity of a unit dosage of an alpha- or a beta-emitting radionuclide. This provision should also apply to commercial nuclear pharmacies.         Response.     Section 35.52(a) will exempt a medical use licensee from measuring the alpha- or beta-activity of a unit dosage, if the licensee obtains that unit dosage from a commercial nuclear pharmacy. This exemption is acceptable because &sect;32.72(c) will require the commercial nuclear pharmacy to measure that activity before dispensing the radioactive drug. Commercial nuclear pharmacies would be required to measure the alpha- or beta-activity of a unit dosage because, otherwise, it might not be measured by anyone. Therefore, this provision cannot be applied to commercial nuclear pharmacies.         Authorized Nuclear Pharmacist        There were several comments concerning this definition. These comments and the NRC's responses are summarized below.     (1)     Comment.     This definition uses the phrase ``a permit issued by a Commission or Agreement State specific licensee of broad scope.'' Is there a standard format for this permit?         Response.     The Commission does not require licensees of broad scope to use a standard format for a permit. The format for this permit may vary from one licensee to another.     (2)     Comment.     The word ``or'' should be inserted between the first and second paragraphs of this definition.         Response.     It is an acceptable regulatory drafting convention that for a sentence with multiple independent conditions, only one ``or'' is necessary between the last condition and the previous condition to indicate that satisfying any one of the conditions is acceptable. Because this definition has three independent conditions, an ``or'' between the first and the second condition is not necessary.         Authorized User             Comment.     There were several comments concerning the use of the phrase ``individual's character'' in the preamble of the proposed rule. The commenters stated that the use of the phrase ``individual's character'' appears inappropriate in considering whether the individual should be approved as an authorized user.         Response.     For the same reasons as set forth in response to comment (2) of &sect;32.72(b), the Commission disagrees with the comment.         Medical Use         There were several comments concerning the addition of human research subjects in the definition of medical use. These comments and the NRC's responses are summarized below.     (1)     Comment.     By including human research subjects under ``medical care,'' it is implied that a physician may be allowed to deliver any radiation dose to a human research subject if the physician can convince the local IRB that the dose is warranted. Also, the concept of implying that human research subjects can be considered as patients may cause difficulty because there are separate laws and considerations for each group.         Response.     The definition under discussion is ``medical use,'' not ``medical care.'' The term ``medical use'' is specifically defined for the purpose of identifying a class of uses involving byproduct material that is regulated by the Commission. By using the term ``patients or human research subjects'' in connection with a requirement, the Commission states that the requirement applies to both patients and human research subjects. The Commission does not intend to imply that a human research subject can be considered as a patient, nor does the Commission intend to imply that a physician may deliver any radiation dose to a human research subject, without appropriate approval.     The Commission recognizes that there are separate medical or pharmacy laws and considerations governing human research subjects and patients. However, the Commission has determined that the radiation safety requirements in its regulations that are designed to protect patients from radiological hazards are equally applicable to human research subjects.

text: nullnull      (2)     Comment.     There could be some difficulty when applying the quality management program to human research subjects. Also, annual review of human use studies is redundant of FDA regulations.       Response.     The quality management program (QMP) applies only to research procedures using quantities of byproduct material specified in &sect;35.32(a)(1). However, because most research procedures use quantities of byproduct material that are less than those specified in &sect;35.32, the QMP would not be required for these research procedures.   The review specified in &sect;35.32(b) applies only to human research procedures for which written directives are required. The review includes evaluation of a representative sample of administrations, recordable events, and misadministrations, to verify compliance with the QMP. These evaluations are specifically related to the requirements in the Commissions's regulations, which are not redundant of FDA regulations.       Section 35.6&blank;Provisions for Research Involving Human Subjects      In the preamble of the proposed rule, the Commission solicited public comment on the number and type of research activities which would not be funded by another Federal agency which has adopted the Federal Policy and which would require a license amendment under the proposed rule. No comments on the number and type of such research activities were received.   Also, the Commission solicited public comment on whether it should broaden or narrow its focus to require compliance with all or none of the provisions of the Federal Policy or equivalent license conditions. The Commission stated that in making these comments, consideration should be given to the fact that all radiation safety provisions of 10 CFR part 35 would be made applicable to research involving human subjects. Several comments were received related to this topic. These comments and the NRC's responses are summarized below.   (1)     Comment.     Omit all regulation of human research with radioactive material because the FDA handles this very nicely.       Response.     The Commission cannot omit all such regulation because it has the responsibility for ensuring adequate protection of public health and safety related to the use of byproduct material, including uses involving human research subjects.   In view of the fact that this final rule would specifically permit, in certain circumstances, NRC licensees to use radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for research involving human subjects, the Commission has the responsibility to address the protection of the rights of those human subjects. At a minimum, this final rule requires NRC licensees who conduct such research to obtain the informed consent of the human research subjects and the prior review and approval of an IRB, within the meaning of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. These requirements apply whether or not the research is conducted, funded, supported, or regulated by another federal agency which has implemented this Federal Policy or is approved by the amendment of an NRC license. However, NRC licensees whose human research is covered by the Federal Policy as adopted by another federal agency, may conduct such research without prior NRC approval. In this way, the provisions of this rule are designed to avoid duplication of the regulations of other federal agencies which have adopted the Federal Policy, including the FDA.   (2)     Comment.     The NRC should take steps to ensure that all provisions of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects are met.       Response.     The basic safety objectives and ethical principles of the Federal Policy will be met by requiring licensees to obtain the informed consent of the human research subjects and prior approval by an IRB. However, some provisions of the Federal Policy are not directly applicable to the Commission's oversight of its licensees, such as the ``Use of Federal Funds,'' ``Evaluations of Proposals for Research to be Conducted or Supported by a Federal Department or Agency,'' and ``Early Termination of Research Support.'' Therefore, NRC does not need to take steps to ensure that all provisions are met.   On the other hand, the proposed rule did not explicitly state that the required informed consent and IRB approval must be in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. Therefore, a phrase ``in accordance with the meaning of these terms as defined and described in the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects'' has been added to the text of the final rule to clarify this point.   There were comments concerning the addition of ``human research subjects'' in the definition of ``medical use'' and the broadening of the quality management program to include human research subjects. These comments and NRC's responses are summarized in the discussion of the definition of ``medical use'' under &sect;35.2.

text: nullnull      Section 35.14&blank;Notification          Comment.     Several commenters stated that the phrase ``within 30 days of the date'' in the proposed &sect;32.72(b)(3) may be misinterpreted and suggested that a new phrase ``no later than 30 days after the date'' should be used.       Response.     See response to comment (1) of section 32.72(b).       Section 35.22&blank;Radiation Safety Committee          Comment.     There were two comments concerning this section. One commenter agreed with the proposed change. The other commenter stated that the proposed change was not warranted because the Radiation Safety Committees (RSC) are overburdened by other duties.       Response.     The Commission believes that it is important for the RSC to review the training and experience of authorized users and authorized nuclear pharmacists and to approve or disapprove any such individuals because this review and the approval or disapproval by RSC is a key factor in the program to ensure radiation safety. Furthermore, existing regulations already require the RSC to perform such review and approval or disapproval of authorized users, Radiation Safety Officers, and teletherapy physicists. By adding authorized nuclear pharmacists to the review and approval or disapproval process of the RSC, the Commission does not believe that a significant burden will be added to the RSC's responsibilities because it is expected that a relatively small number of authorized nuclear pharmacists will be included in Part 35 licenses.       Section 35.25&blank;Supervision          Comment.     Several commenters stated that this section should not be so restrictive and that instructions to workers can only be provided by the supervising individuals. These commenters suggested that the provision for instructing workers may be delegated to other qualified individuals. Similarly, they suggested that periodic review of the work of the supervised individuals may also be delegated to other qualified individuals.       Response.     The Commission agrees that the workers may be instructed by the licensee, the supervising individuals, or other qualified individuals as long as the instructors are knowledgeable about the subject areas. The regulatory text has been revised to indicate that although the licensee may delegate these tasks to other qualified individuals, the licensee retains the responsibility for instructing workers.   However, the requirement for periodically reviewing the work of supervised individuals remains with the supervising authorized nuclear pharmacist or physician authorized user. The Commission believes that the supervising individual is in a better position to review the work than another individual.

text: nullnull      Section 35.27&blank;Visiting authorized user.           Comment.     One commenter suggested that this section should be retained. The commenter stated that the paperwork associated with the proposed notification (&sect;35.14) would be unduly burdensome for temporary authorized users who provide coverage during another authorized user's vacation or sickness.       Response.     The Commission disagrees with the commenter. When allowing a temporary authorized user to work, the licensee does not need to notify the NRC each time that the individual provides coverage during another authorized user's vacation or sickness. Under the notification requirement (&sect;35.14), the licensee needs to notify the NRC no later than 30 days after the date the licensee permits the individual to work as a temporary authorized user. The next notification is when that individual permanently discontinues as a temporary authorized user. A notification is not required during each period of coverage between the beginning and the termination of the service of the temporary authorized user. This notification procedure also applies to a temporary authorized nuclear pharmacist. Thus, this section has been removed.       Section 35.50&blank;Possession, Use, Calibration, and Checks of Dose Calibrators.       Several comments were received related to this section. These comments and NRC's responses are summarized below.   (1)     Comment.     The proposed phrase ``over the range of its use between the highest dosage that will be administered to a patient or human research subject and 1.1 megabecquerels (30 microcuries)'' should be clarified. ``Over the range of its use'' could mean between the highest and lowest dosages that will be administered; the lowest dosage may not be 1.1 megabecquerels.       Response.     The Commission agrees with the comment. The final amendment will be modified to delete the phrase ``over the range of its use.''   (2)     Comment.     Linearity tests for a dose calibrator should cover the range from the highest patient dosage to the lowest patient dosage that will be administered by a licensee. The lowest dosage could be in millicurie quantities for many licensees. Thus, it is not necessary to test linearity to 1.1 megabecquerels (30 microcuries).       Response.     The intent of changing the lower limit of the linearity tests from 10 microcuries to 30 microcuries is to conform with the requirements of the Quality Management Program (&sect;35.32) and to relieve a minor burden for measuring activities between 10 and 30 microcuries without reducing radiation safety. To go beyond this by changing this limit to the lowest patient dosage would have ramifications on the constancy checks, accuracy tests, and recordkeeping requirements (i.e., &sect;&sect;35.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3); and 35.53(a), (b), and (c)(3)). Therefore, deleting this specific lower limit is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.   (3)     Comment.     In expressing the units in both English units and SI units, English units should be first, followed by SI units in parentheses. Also, is there any scientific rationale for the precision implied by 1.1 mBq, instead of using 1 mBq?       Response.     The Commission published a policy statement entitled ``Conversion to the Metric System'' (57 FR 46202; October 7, 1992). This policy statement specifies that the first unit will be in the SI unit with the English unit shown in brackets. In terms of significant digits, the implied uncertainty for 30 microcuries is somewhere between 29 and 31 microcuries and for 1.1 mBq is somewhere between 1.0 and 1.2 mBq. If 1 mBq is used, the implied precision would be less. Therefore, 1.1 mBq has been retained in the final rule.       Section 35.52&blank;Possession, Use, Calibration, and Checks of instrumentation to measure dosages of alpha- or beta-emitting radionuclides.       There were several comments concerning this section. These comments and the NRC's responses are discussed below.   (1)     Comment.     The proposed requirements for linearity and geometry tests are not consistent with methods of assaying alpha or beta emitters, such as liquid scintillation counting.       Response.     The regulatory text includes the phrase ``as appropriate for the use of the instrument.'' Therefore, if linearity or geometry tests are not appropriate for an instrument, the tests are not required.   (2)     Comment.     Does the term ``unit dosage'' include a vial that contains multiple dosages?       Response.     A unit dosage can be either a pre-filled syringe or a vial that contains a prescribed dosage for a patient or a human research subject. Thus, a vial containing multiple dosages is not a unit dosage.   (3)     Comment.     In some cases, it may not be practical to order an exact unit dosage before the administration to a patient or human research subject. For example, the size of a brain cyst is determined during surgery and a precise dosage cannot be prescribed before the operation.

text: nullnull          Response.     In this example, an estimated unit dosage must first be ordered from the nuclear pharmacy. After the physician authorized user determines the precise dosage needed for the individual, the licensee may use either volume or weight to draw the precise dosage from the vial. The use of volume or weight for drawing a smaller dosage from a vial containing an estimated dosage is acceptable because that vial contains only the estimated dosage for one individual. Thus, even if an error is made, the maximum error would be limited to the estimated dosage.  (4)     Comment.     When drawing a dosage from a vial containing multiple dosages, a licensee should be allowed to determine the dosage by using volume and a measurement relative to some standard.      Response.     Relative measurement of the alpha- or beta-activity of a radioactive drug could be inaccurate for a variety of reasons, including inconsistent placement of the vial in the instrument's chamber. Without specific details of the procedure for this relative measurement, the accuracy of the measurement is unknown. Therefore, the proposed method of using volume and a measurement relative to some standard cannot be generically accepted.  However, if a medical use licensee would like to propose a specific set of procedures for a relative measurement of a particular isotope that would provide acceptable accuracy, the licensee may apply for a license amendment on a case-by-case basis.      Section 35.53&blank;Measurement of Dosages of Unsealed Byproduct Material for Medical Use      There were some comments concerning measurements of dosages. These comments and NRC's responses have been discussed under &sect;35.52.      Section 35.100&blank;Use of Unsealed Byproduct Material for Uptake, Dilution, and Excretion      There were several comments concerning this section. These comments and the NRC's responses are discussed below.    (1)     Comment.     The NRC should continue to permit medical use licensees to share a nuclear pharmacy without requiring a Part 32 license.      Response.     See response to comment &para; (1) of section 32.72(a)(2).    (2)     Comment.     Section 35.100 should be modified to allow a medical use licensee to obtain a radioactive drug only for research purposes from those Part 33 licensees who are authorized to manufacture and distribute radioactive drugs to be used only for research experiments.      Response.     The Commission currently permits a Part 33 licensee to distribute, on a limited basis, radioactive drugs to be used only for research experiments through license amendment approvals on a case-by-case basis. As discussed in the response to comments on 10 CFR 32.72(a)(2), Part 33 licensees seeking this authority must first obtain a license amendment and receive an authorization for limited distribution pursuant to Part 32. Therefore, it is not necessary to modify &sect;35.100 because it will allow medical use licensees to receive radioactive drugs from a Part 33 licensee authorized for limited distribution.      Section 35.910&blank;Training for Uptake, Dilution, and Excretion Studies          Comment.     One commenter stated that the proposed amendment to this section would impose severe restrictions on basic human research. The commenter further stated that researchers who desire approval to administer radioisotopes for one or two basic studies in humans and who are not preparing to become nuclear medicine physicians, will not meet these strict criteria.      Response.     Under the NRC's existing regulatory framework, administering byproduct material to a patient or a human research subject must be done by a physician authorized user or by an individual under the supervision of a physician authorized user. The use of the term ``patient or human research subject'' in this section is to clarify that, if a researcher intends to conduct basic studies using human subjects involving byproduct material, it is necessary to have a physician authorized user provide supervision so that the researcher may administer byproduct material to human research subjects. This is an existing regulatory position and it has not been changed by this rulemaking.

text: nullnull      Section 35.930&blank;Training for Therapeutic Use of Unsealed Byproduct Material          Comment.     One commenter stated that the certification by the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) should be recognized in all applicable sections in 10 CFR Part 35. Under the existing regulations, the Commission has recognized AOBR in &sect;&sect;35.910, 35.920, 35.940, 35.950, and 35.960, but not in &sect;35.300.      Response.     Following receipt of this comment, the Commission requested additional information from AOBR concerning training and certification criteria for therapeutic use of unsealed byproduct material. After reviewing supporting documents provided by the AOBR, the Commission has determined that the certification of AOBR is equivalent to the certification of American Board of Radiology (ABR). Therefore, recognition of certification by AOBR has been added in &sect;35.930 of this final rule for certification granted after 1984 because all candidates certified by AOBR since 1984 will meet the NRC's training requirements.      Section 35.972&blank;Recentness of Training          Comment.     There were several comments concerning whether the recentness of training should be 5 years as in the existing regulations, or 7 years as in the proposed rule. Some commenters favored 5 years and stated that the clinical practice changes rapidly, thus, 5 years is more appropriate. Other commenters supported 7 years and stated that 5 years would be burdensome and would not ensure superior training.      Response.     The training required in Part 35 concerns radiation safety principles and practices for the protection of public health and safety. These radiation safety principles and practices are not expected to change rapidly with time. Therefore, the Commission is adopting 7 years because this will not reduce the level of radiation protection provided to workers and the public but will reduce the regulatory burden imposed on licensees.      Section 35.980&blank;Training for Authorized Nuclear Pharmacist      There were several comments pertaining to this section. These comments and the NRC's responses are summarized below.  (1)     Comment.     The requirement for a preceptor statement is unnecessary and is irrelevant to the mission of the NRC. Many fully qualified nuclear pharmacists would be excluded from being an authorized nuclear pharmacist by this administrative requirement.      Response.     The written certification from a preceptor is a necessary part of the training and experience criteria. Even though an individual has completed the required 700 hours of the structured educational program, it is still uncertain as to whether this individual is capable of independently operating a nuclear pharmacy. The preceptor's statement is needed to ensure that this individual has achieved the competency to do so.  With respect to a nuclear pharmacist who is currently qualified to be an authorized nuclear pharmacist, a new section (&sect;35.981) has been added to address this issue.  (2)     Comment.     It appears that the proposed rule is leaning towards board certification as the only available avenue open to a nuclear pharmacist desiring to be recognized as an authorized nuclear pharmacist in the near future.      Response.     There are other available avenues for a qualified individual to be recognized as an authorized nuclear pharmacist. Other avenues include: (i) Meeting the training criteria and obtaining a preceptor statement from an authorized nuclear pharmacist; or (ii) Meeting the ``grandfathering'' provisions as specified in &sect;35.981 of this final rule.  (3)     Comment.     Whether an individual is qualified as an authorized nuclear pharmacist should be based on education and training, not just based on BPS certification.      Response.     The Commission agrees that qualification as an authorized nuclear pharmacist should be based on training and experience. This final rule provides several ways, including BPS certification, to achieve authorized nuclear pharmacist status, all of which include a minimum level of training and experience. The various ways to achieve this status are provided in &sect;&sect;35.980 and 35.981.  (4)     Comment.     It is imperative that training programs be monitored by appropriate independent oversight processes (e.g., American Council on Pharmaceutical Education in the case of pharmacy).

text: nullnull          Response.     The Commission agrees that it could be useful for a training program to be monitored by an independent oversight group. In addition, the Commission encourages voluntary oversight by an independent group such as a professional association. However, given the oversight roles of the preceptor and the Radiation Safety Committee, the Commission does not see a need to incorporate such a requirement.     (5)     Comment.     If an authorized nuclear pharmacist decides not to seek recertification as a Board Certified Nuclear Pharmacist, would the individual lose the authorized nuclear pharmacist status?         Response.     See response to comment (3) of &sect;32.72(b).     (6)     Comment.     It appears that the NRC desires to make ``authorized nuclear pharmacist'' status available only to those pharmacists who are engaged in active clinical practice settings. This status should be also available to qualified nuclear pharmacists working in facilities other than clinical practice settings, such as in the research laboratories or academic settings.         Response.     An authorized nuclear pharmacist who meets the training requirements as specified in &sect;35.980 should be competent to independently operate a nuclear pharmacy regardless of the setting. When there is a need for an authorized nuclear pharmacist outside the clinical setting, qualified individuals in research laboratories or academic settings may also be designated as authorized nuclear pharmacists.     (7)     Comment.     Authorized nuclear pharmacist status should be available to those individuals who have practiced radiopharmacy for a long time but who are not licensed pharmacists.         Response.     The Commission believes that an individual should not practice pharmacy unless this individual is licensed as a pharmacist by a State. Thus, an authorized nuclear pharmacist must be a licensed pharmacist as required by &sect;&sect;35.980 and 35.981. However, an experienced individual (e.g., a nuclear chemist) may continue to work in a nuclear pharmacy under the supervision of an authorized nuclear pharmacist or a physician authorized user.     (8)     Comment.     The Florida State Board of Pharmacy issues nuclear pharmacists a separate license based on a review of the individual's qualification by its Nuclear Pharmacy Committee. Additionally, it requires a mandatory 12-hours per annum of continuing education in a specific range of topic areas pertinent to nuclear pharmacy practice. With this type of licensing review process already in place, how would the NRC consider applying this towards its ``limited grandfathering'' process for granting ``authorized nuclear pharmacist'' status to Florida nuclear pharmacists? Would the Commission consider this established Florida process for pharmacists as carrying sufficient weight which might serve as a third alternative to its proposed language in 10 CFR 35.980?         Response.     Section 35.980 specifies that a pharmacist could be qualified as an authorized nuclear pharmacist in two ways: (i) Through BPS certification; or (ii) through a structured educational program and a preceptor's statement. Because qualification as an authorized nuclear pharmacist depends primarily on training and experience, if Florida licensed nuclear pharmacists currently meet either (i) or (ii), they could qualify as authorized nuclear pharmacists. If they do not meet either (i) or (ii), they would need either more training or experience, or a preceptor's statement to qualify. Therefore, there is no benefit to adding a third alternative to 10 CFR 35.980.     For ``grandfathering'' an experienced nuclear pharmacist, a new section (&sect;35.981) has been added to the final rule. This section specifies that an experienced pharmacist will be given authorized nuclear pharmacist status if the individual:     (i) Is a licensed pharmacist,     (ii) Is currently working in a nuclear pharmacy, and     (iii) Has completed a structured educational program as specified in &sect;35.980(b)(1).     A Florida licensed nuclear pharmacist who is currently working in a nuclear pharmacy could satisfy the first two criteria. However, the comment letter did not provide any information regarding whether this individual meets the third criterion. Therefore, such a nuclear pharmacist could qualify as an authorized nuclear pharmacist if that individual has completed a structured educational program that equals or exceeds the requirements of &sect;35.980(b)(1).         Section 35.981&blank;Training for Experienced Nuclear Pharmacists            Comment.     This section was not included in the proposed rule, but has been added to the final rule in response to numerous comments. The comments suggested that the NRC should provide a mechanism for ``grandfathering'' qualified nuclear pharmacists who are currently working in hospital-based nuclear pharmacies, similar to the mechanism proposed for ``grandfathering'' qualified individuals who are currently working in commercial nuclear pharmacies.

text: nullnull          Response.     The Commission agrees with these comments because the ``grandfathering'' provisions should apply regardless of whether a qualified nuclear pharmacist is currently working in a commercial nuclear pharmacy or a hospital-based nuclear pharmacy. Therefore, this section has been added to the final rule.         III. Discussion of Final Rule Text         This section discusses those provisions of the final rule in which the proposed rule language has been modified. These modifications are either based on public comments or the Commission's identified need to modify or clarify the rule language. Provisions in which the final rule language remains the same as the proposed rule language will not be discussed in this section. Referring to section V entitled ``Text of Final Regulations'' may expedite the reader's understanding of this discussion.         Section 32.72&blank;Manufacture, Preparation, or Transfer for Commercial Distribution of Radioactive Drugs Containing Byproduct Material for Medical Use Under 10 CFR Part 35        Section 32.72(a)(4)        This paragraph contains one modification of the proposed rule language. The phrase ``one label is acceptable to NRC provided that it contains all of the information which NRC requires'' has been added at the end of the last sentence of this paragraph. This phrase has been added to clarify that this rule allows licensees to use one label if that label contains all the information specified in this section.         Section 32.72(b)        The proposed rule language has been modified to clarify the intent of this section. These modifications are discussed below.     (1) The phrase ``a licensee described by paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section'' has been moved from proposed &sect;32.72(b)(1) to the introductory phrase of &sect;32.72(b) to clarify that this phrase applies throughout paragraph (b).     (2) The final rule text of &sect;32.72(b)(1) is essentially the same as the proposed (b)(1) except that the reference to the definition of ``authorized nuclear pharmacist'' in Part 35 has been moved to paragraph (b)(2).     (3) A new &sect;35.72(b)(2) has been added to the final rule to make clear that there are three different ways that an individual may qualify as an authorized nuclear pharmacist.     (4) A new &sect;35.72(b)(3) has been added to the final rule to make clear that the actions authorized in &sect;32.72(b)(1) and (2) are permitted in spite of more restrictive language in existing license conditions and to avoid the need for many license amendments in order to implement the Commission's intentions.     (5) The proposed &sect;32.72(b)(2), which provided criteria for ``grandfathering'' qualified Part 32 ``authorized users,'' has been redesignated as &sect;32.72(b)(4). Also, the proposed rule specified that a pharmacist may be ``grandfathered'' if the individual is identified on a Commission license as an ``authorized user'' on or before the ``effective date'' of the rule; this cutoff date has been changed to the publication date of the final rule. This change is needed because the Commission believes that ``grandfathering'' is only appropriate for those qualified nuclear pharmacists who are ``authorized users'' on or before the publication date of this final rule.     (6) The proposed &sect;32.72(b)(3), which requires licensees to provide certain documents, has been redesignated as &sect;32.72(b)(5). The final rule text in this paragraph has been modified to include several editorial changes, including:     (i) Replacing the phrase ``the individual's board certification, the license, or the permit'' by the phrase ``each individual's certification by the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties, the Commission or Agreement State license, or the permit issued by a licensee of broad scope'';     (ii) Replacing the phrase ``within 30 days of the date'' by the phrase ``no later than 30 days after the date''; and     (iii) Adding ``pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(iii)'' to indicate that a notification is not required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) because a license amendment is required.         Section 35.2&blank;Definitions            Authorized nuclear pharmacist.     During the public comment period, the Commission became aware that the word ``currently'' is unnecessary in the proposed phrase ``Authorized nuclear pharmacist means a pharmacist who is: (1) Currently board certified as a nuclear pharmacist by     XXX    .'' Therefore, the word, ``currently,'' has been removed in the final rule.

text: nullnull          Misadministration.     During the public comment period, the Commission became aware of the need to clarify paragraph (4)(iii) of this definition. The existing rule language, ``When the calculated weekly administered dose is 30 percent greater than the weekly prescribed dose,'' if interpreted literally, means that a misadministration has occurred only when the calculated weekly administered dose is exactly 30 percent greater than the weekly prescribed dose. The Commission intended for this definition to cover incidents in which there is a difference of 30 percent     or more     between the calculated weekly administered dose and the weekly prescribed dose. To ensure that there is no ambiguity as to the meaning of this provision, it has been reworded and the key phrase in the rule language has been changed from ``30 percent greater than'' to ``30 percent or more.'' Because this better expresses the intent of the existing rule and is a minor administrative correction, the Commission believes that it can be incorporated in this final rule without having first been included in the proposed rule.         Recordable event.     The existing regulatory text of paragraph (5) of this definition of ``recordable event'' contains the same word structure as paragraph (4)(iii) of the definition of misadministration (discussed above). To ensure that there is no ambiguity as to the meaning of this provision, it has been reworded and the key phrase in the rule language has been changed from ``15 percent greater than'' to ``15 percent or more.'' Because this better expresses the intent of the existing rule and is a minor administrative correction, the Commission believes that it can be incorporated in this final rule without having first been included in the proposed rule.         Visiting authorized user.     During the public comment period, the Commission became aware of the need to delete this definition. This definition is no longer necessary because &sect;35.27, ``Visiting authorized user,'' in which this definition is applicable is being deleted. Therefore, this definition is being removed from the final rule.         Section 35.6&blank;Provisions for Research Involving Human Subjects        This section contains one modification of the proposed rule language. The phrase ``in accordance with the meaning of these terms as defined and described in the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects'' has been added at the end of the last sentence of this section. This phrase has been added to explicitly state that the terms ``informed consent'' and ``IRB approval'' have the same meaning ascribed to those terms in the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects.         Section 35.11&blank;License Required        There is no change between the final rule language and the proposed rule language. However, licensees are reminded that if a licensee intends to increase its possession limit for any byproduct material isotope or add any new byproduct material isotopes, the licensee must first obtain a license amendment.         Section 35.13&blank;License Amendments        There is no change between the final rule language and the proposed rule language in this section. However, the purpose of this discussion is to remind medical use licensees who are not medical institutions that, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, they must review the necessary credentials and approve or disapprove any individual who is to work as an authorized user or authorized nuclear pharmacist. In a medical institution, this review and approval must be performed by its Radiation Safety Committee (see &sect;35.22(b)(2)(ii)).         Section 35.14&blank;Notification        This section contains two editorial changes: (1) the phrase ``within 30 days of the date'' has been replaced by the phrase ``no later than 30 days after the date,'' and (2) the phrase ``the license, or the permit'' has been replaced by ``the Commission or Agreement state license, or the permit issued by a licensee of broad scope.''         Section 35.25&blank;Supervision        There is a modification to the proposed rule in this section. The proposed rule stated that the supervising authorized nuclear pharmacist or physician authorized user must instruct the workers. The final rule allows the instruction to be delegated to other qualified individuals. This change is based on public comments requesting that the instruction of workers be done by the supervising individuals as well as by other qualified individuals. However, the requirement for periodically reviewing the work of supervised individuals remains with the supervising authorized nuclear pharmacist or physician authorized user.

text: nullnull      Section 35.50&blank;Possession, Use, Calibration, and Checks of Dose Calibrators        There is an editorial change in this section. The phrase in the proposed rule ``over the range of its use between     XXX     and     XXX    '' has been replaced by ``over a range from     XXX     to     XXX    .''         Section 35.900&blank;Radiation Safety Officer        Two additional board certifications have been recognized in this section of the final rule.     During the public comment period, the Commission became aware of the need to recognize certifications by the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine (AOBNM) and the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR). A letter dated August 16, 1990, from Richard E. Cunningham (Director, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NRC), to Paul J. Chase (Chairman, AOBR and Vice President, AOBNM), stated that the NRC intended to include certifications of (1) AOBR in &sect;35.900, and (2) AOBNM in &sect;&sect;35.900, 35.910, and 35.920 in the next amendment to 10 CFR Part 35. Therefore, the certifications by AOBR and AOBNM have been added to this section of the final rule.         Section 35.910&blank;Training for Uptake, Dilution, and Excretion Studies    Section 35.920&blank;Training for Imaging and Localization Studies        One additional board certification has been recognized in both sections of the final rule.     As discussed in the previous section, the Commission became aware of the need to recognize certification by AOBNM. Therefore, the certification by AOBNM has been added to both sections of the final rule.         Section 35.930&blank;Training for Therapeutic Use of Unsealed Byproduct Material        Two additional board certifications have been recognized in this section of the final rule.     A comment stated that certification by the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) should be recognized in all applicable sections of 10 CFR Part 35. Under the existing regulations, the Commission has recognized AOBR certification in &sect;&sect;35.910, 35,920, 35.940, 35.950, and 35.960.     Following receipt of this comment, the Commission requested additional information from AOBR concerning training and certification criteria for therapeutic use of unsealed byproduct material. After reviewing supporting documents provided by the American Osteopathic College of Radiology (AOCR), the Commission has determined that AOBR certification is equivalent to certification by the American Board of Radiology (ABR). Therefore, recognition of certification by AOBR has been added in &sect;35.930 of this final rule for certification granted after 1984 because all candidates certified by AOBR since 1984 will meet the NRC's training requirements.     During the public comment period, the Commission also became aware of the need to recognize in &sect;35.930 certification by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. This is in addition to the recognition reflected in &sect;&sect;35.900, 35.910, and 35.920 of the proposed rule. A letter dated June 3, 1992, from John E. Glenn (Chief, Medical, Academic and Commercial Use Safety Branch, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NRC), to Gilles D. Hurteau of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, stated that certification by the latter is acceptable for approval, among other things, as an authorized user in &sect;35.300. Therefore, certification by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada has been added to this section of the final rule.         Section 35.981&blank;Training for Experienced Nuclear Pharmacists        This section was not included in the proposed rule, but has been added to the final rule in response to numerous comments. This section has been patterned after the provisions in 10 CFR Part 32 for ``grandfathering'' an ``authorized user.''     To ``grandfather'' an experienced nuclear pharmacist, the licensee needs to apply for a license amendment identifying that individual as an authorized nuclear pharmacist. The licensee must receive the license amendment before allowing that individual to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist.     A licensee seeking to ``grandfather'' a nuclear pharmacist must ensure that the individual has completed a structured educational program as specified in &sect;35.980(b)(1) on or before (the date of publication in the     Federal Register    ) and is currently working as a nuclear pharmacist. However, the individual does not need a preceptor statement (&sect;35.980(b)(2)) and the individual's training, specified above, does not need to be within 7 years preceding the date of application (&sect;35.972).

text: nullnull      Agreement State Compatibility         There were numerous public comments concerning compatibility. The commenters offered a wide range of opinions, from those recommending no compatibility to those favoring identical requirements between Agreement States and the NRC. These comments and NRC's responses will be discussed at the end of this section.     After considering the comments, the Commission has determined that the compatibility levels for the final rule should remain the same as the proposed rule. All definitions contained in &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 that are established or modified by this rulemaking are Division 1 levels of compatibility. These definitions must be the same for all NRC and Agreement State licensees so that national consistency can be maintained.     Additionally, &sect;&sect;32.72, 35.6, 35.22(b)(2), 35.25, 35.50, 35.52, 35.53, 35.920, 35.972, 35.980, and 35.981 are Division 2 levels of compatibility because requirements at least this stringent are necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety. The Agreement States will be allowed to establish requirements that are more stringent than the NRC's requirements, but not less stringent.     It would be appropriate for Agreement States to adopt the remaining sections of these revisions to Part 35 in this rulemaking, but it is not necessary to require any degree of compatibility between NRC and the States. Therefore, a Division 3 level of compatibility is appropriate for these sections.     The Commission is currently developing a new policy on Agreement State compatibility. This development will include involvement of the Agreement States and the general public. At the conclusion of this effort, the Commission will implement guidance on the application of adequacy and compatibility and in light of the new guidance will reassess the existing compatibility levels.     The Commission expects Agreement States to adopt rules required to maintain compatibility within 3 years after NRC's rules become effective. However, the States may elect to implement on a temporary basis the requirements contained in this final rule through license conditions prior to promulgation of the rule necessary for compatibility. In the preamble of the notice of the proposed rule, the Commission stated that some Agreement States, faced with administrative and resource constraints, may find the 3-year time period difficult to attain and may prefer that NRC extend flexibility in such cases to allow the States to implement the requirements through license conditions. In the same notice, the Commission requested public comment on permitting Agreement States flexibility in this regard, and if permitted, under what conditions.     The NRC did not receive any comments on implementing requirements through license conditions. Under current policy, the Agreement States have the flexibility to implement the requirements contained in this final rule on a temporary basis through license conditions, until they adopt compatible rules. In addition, this issue will be addressed in the development of a new policy statement on adequacy and compatibility.     There were numerous comments related to Agreement State compatibility. These comments and the NRC's responses are summarized below.

text: nullnull      (1)     Comment    . It is inappropriate for the NRC to use the existing policy for compatibility determinations regarding this rulemaking because the NRC is currently considering a new policy.         Response    . The Commission must use the existing policy for compatibility determinations regarding all rulemakings until the new policy becomes effective. At that time, the Commission expects that the existing compatibility determinations will be reviewed in light of the new policy.     (2)     Comment    . There is an increasing tendency of NRC to use the term ``safety significance'' in justifying the NRC's position on compatibility determination. But the question is, ``How much significance?''          Response    . Under the existing policy the Commission considers the safety significance of a particular requirement, i.e., whether it is necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety, in determining whether it should be an item of Agreement State compatibility. If it is necessary to ensure adequate protection, the requirement will, at a minimum, be Division 2 level of compatibility. In addition, if the requirement is both necessary for adequate protection and clear communication, it will be a Division 1 level of compatibility. Using these criteria, the Commission has made the findings on compatibility described above. The basic objective of these findings is to ensure that the public receives adequate radiation protection during medical procedures without undue interference in the practices of pharmacy and medicine. The relationship between compatibility and health and safety will be clarified in the new policy on Agreement State compatibility.     (3)     Comment    . Some commenters suggested that Agreement States' requirements should be identical to NRC's requirements. Other commenters suggested that a high degree of consistency between Agreement States and the NRC on medical rules is not necessary.         Response    . The Commission believes in some cases, that it is necessary for Agreement States' regulations to be essentially verbatim, i.e., identical, to NRC regulations. In other cases, it is necessary for the Agreement States to adopt the provisions in a consistent although not identical form. As discussed above in the response to comment (2), the Commission has determined which provisions of this rule are a Division 1 level of compatibility. Except for definitions which are a Division 1 level of compatibility, all other provisions of this final rule are either Division 2 or 3 levels of compatibility. Thus, for this final rule, uniformity is not required between Agreement States and the NRC for all provisions.     (4)     Comment    . Medical facilities are essentially fixed facilities with little or no implications for interstate commerce. Where is the justification for the NRC's position?         Response    . In the proposed rule, the NRC did not state that the reason for the proposed compatibility levels was due to interstate commerce implications. As stated earlier, the justifications for compatibility are as follows. All definitions contained in &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 that are established or modified by this rulemaking are Division 1 levels of compatibility. These definitions must be the same for all NRC and Agreement State licensees so that national consistency can be maintained. Also, certain specific sections are Division 2 levels of compatibility because requirements at least this stringent are necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety.

text: nullnull      (5)     Comment.     The proposed rule stated that all definitions in &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 would be Division 1 levels of compatibility. This would include definitions in &sect;30.4 that do not relate to medical uses and should not be affected by this rulemaking.       Response.     The language in the preamble for the proposed rule intended to indicate that all definitions in &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 that are established or modified by this rulemaking would be Division 1 levels of compatibility. Levels of compatibility for other definitions in existing &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 that are not modified in this rulemaking will remain unchanged. The language in this preamble has been modified to clarify this point.   (6)     Comment.     Based on the State Agreements Program Procedure B.7, all Part 35 items categorized in that procedure are Division 3.       Response.     Before the quality management program and misadministration rulemaking became effective, all sections in Part 35 were Division 3 levels of compatibility. However, following that amendment (56 FR 34104; July 25, 1991), the levels of compatibility for Part 35 were modified as follows: The definitions associated with the quality management rule and misadministrations in &sect;35.2 became Division 1 levels of compatibility; &sect;&sect;35.32 and 35.33 became Division 2 levels of compatibility; &sect;35.8 became a Division 4 level of compatibility; and all other sections of Part 35 remained Division 3 levels of compatibility.   (7)     Comment.     The proposed rule stated that Agreement States are expected to adopt rules required to maintain compatibility within 3 years. Agreement States should be able to adopt this rulemaking in a shorter time.       Response.     Some Agreement States may need less time to adopt certain parts of this rulemaking. Other Agreement States may need the full 3 years to adopt the rule because of constraints on resources. Therefore, the Commission retains the 3-year period for adopting this rule. In reevaluating its compatibility policy, the Commission is considering whether the time can be shortened when demonstrable health and safety considerations require it.   (8)     Comment.     What would happen if an Agreement State fails to adopt requirements that are items of compatibility?       Response.     During the periodic review of the Agreement State's program, the NRC would determine whether the State meets the compatibility requirements. If not, the State would be notified that its program must be compatible with the NRC's requirements, and using current procedures a finding of compatibility for the Agreement State program would be withheld. Such a failure, if uncorrected or unjustified, could lead to the loss of the State's status as an Agreement State.   (9)     Comment.     Creating a Division 1 or Division 2 level of compatibility for parts of this rule may cause conflict with State boards of pharmacy and medicine.       Response.     The provisions contained in this rulemaking that require a Division 1 or Division 2 level of compatibility are necessary to provide an adequate level of protection of public health and safety from radiological hazards. In addition, the Commission is not aware of any conflicts between these provisions and the requirements of State boards of pharmacy and medicine.

text: nullnull      IV. Administrative Statements      Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability       The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this final amendment is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and therefore an environmental impact statement is not required. The final amendment provides greater flexibility for physician authorized users to use byproduct material in the practice of medicine. The final amendment will also incorporate into the regulations the concept of authorized nuclear pharmacists to permit properly qualified pharmacists to prepare radioactive drugs containing byproduct material in the practice of pharmacy.   The final rule will allow physician authorized users greater discretion to prepare and use radioactive drugs containing byproduct material. The final rule will also allow authorized nuclear pharmacists greater discretion to prepare radioactive drugs containing byproduct material. It is expected that there will be no increase in radiation exposure to the public or to the environment beyond the exposures currently resulting from delivering the byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material to patients or human research subjects. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based is available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact are available from Anthony N. Tse (see     FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT     heading).       Paperwork Reduction Act Statement       This final rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq). These requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers 3150&hyph;0001 and 3150&hyph;0010 for amendments to 10 CFR Parts 32 and 35, respectively.   The reduction in public burden for this collection of information is estimated to be a savings of 408 hours per year for 300 NRC licensees, or an average 1.4 hours per year per licensee, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6 F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;10202, (3150&hyph;0001, -0010, and -0120), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.       Regulatory Analysis       The Commission has prepared a final regulatory analysis on this regulation. The analysis examines the benefits and impacts considered by the Commission. No public comments were received on the draft regulatory analysis associated with the proposed rule. The final regulatory analysis is available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis are available from Anthony N. Tse (see     FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT     heading).       Regulatory Flexibility Certification       As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects medical use licensees including some private practice physicians. Some of these licensees would be considered small entities under the NRC's size standards (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991). The amendments provide greater discretion for physician authorized users to use byproduct material in the practice of medicine. The amendments will also incorporate into the regulations the concept of authorized nuclear pharmacists to allow properly qualified pharmacists greater discretion to prepare (including compound) radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for medical use. This rule is expected to reduce regulatory burdens on medical use licensees, including small entities. No public comments were received related to the regulatory flexibility certification associated with the proposed rule.

The amendment eliminates the requirement that an electronic terminal receipt disclose a number or code that     uniquely     identifies the consumer, the consumer's account, or the access device. This requirement currently poses a significant security risk for consumers and financial institutions by making information accessible to criminals that they then use to withdraw funds from consumers' accounts. The Board has adopted an interim rule that deletes the requirement for a unique identification, thus enabling institutions to truncate card or account numbers. The Board seeks public comment on the interim rule, which the Board will adopt in final following the close of the comment period.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:        I. Background        The Board's Regulation E implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA). The EFTA provides a basic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfer (EFT) systems. Types of transfers covered by the act and regulation include transfers initiated through an automated teller machine (ATM), point-of-sale terminal, automated clearinghouse, telephone bill-payment system, or home banking program. Regulation E establishes restrictions on the unsolicited issuance of ATM cards and other access devices; requires disclosure of terms and conditions of an EFT service; calls for documentation of EFTs through terminal receipts and periodic account statements; provides limitations on consumer liability for unauthorized transfers; and establishes procedures for error resolution.        II. Summary of Amendment        Section 205.9_Documentation of Transfers        Paragraph (a)_Receipts at Electronic Terminals        Under the EFTA, when a consumer initiates an EFT at an electronic terminal, the financial institution must make a written receipt available to the consumer. The receipt must identify in some way the consumer's account with the financial institution from or to which funds are transferred.    Under the Board's Regulation E, institutions can comply with this identification requirement by including a number or code on the receipt that identifies the access device used to initiate the transfer, the consumer initiating the transaction, or the consumer's accounts. To ensure adequate identification, the Board's regulation specifies that the number or code should be ``unique.''    This identification requirement was adopted in 1979, and over the years many financial institutions have met the requirement by disclosing consumers' card or account numbers on the receipt; until recently, doing so did not appear to represent a security risk for financial institutions. Now, a large number of institutions are reporting that the requirement for a unique identification poses a significant security risk for consumers and financial institutions. These institutions, together with trade associations, have asked that the Board revise the rule to prevent ATM fraud by persons who observe_and often videotape_a consumer entering a personal identification number (PIN) on the ATM keypad. These persons retrieve terminal receipts that have been discarded at ATM locations to obtain the consumer's account or ATM card number. They then manufacture a counterfeit ATM card and use the combination of PIN and card withdraw funds from the consumer's account. One estimate places the industry losses at an annual cost between 25 and 40 million dollars, and climbing; others believe this estimate is understated. Data verifying the extent of institutions' fraud losses due to this problem are publicly unavailable because the data are proprietary in nature. But several large financial institutions indicate they have sustained losses of as much as a million dollars in one week.    Institutions say that truncating the consumer's account or card number on the receipt would help to counter the problem. Under the current receipt provision in Regulation E, however, they cannot readily do so because of the likelihood that the identification number on the receipt no longer would be ``unique'' among the institution's customers. Institutions have considered other ways to reduce risk, including retrofitting terminals to uniquely identify a consumer by a means other than a card or account number. Another approach would be for the terminal to give customers the option not to receive a receipt, for customers who might otherwise tend to discard their receipts at the ATM. While these approaches could help reduce fraud, they would be extremely costly to implement. Educational efforts to encourage consumers not to discard their receipts at the ATM site generally have been unsuccessful.                                12 CFR Part 205          <RINDOCK>[Regulation E; Docket No. R&hyph;0859]</RINDOCK>        Electronic Fund Transfers       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Interim rule with request for comments.          </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The Board is publishing an interim rule amending Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfers). The amendment eliminates the requirement that an electronic terminal receipt disclose a number or code that     uniquely     identifies the consumer, the consumer's account, or the access device. This requirement currently poses a significant security risk for consumers and financial institutions by making information accessible to criminals that they then use to withdraw funds from consumers' accounts. The Board has adopted an interim rule that deletes the requirement for a unique identification, thus enabling institutions to truncate card or account numbers. The Board seeks public comment on the interim rule, which the Board will adopt in final following the close of the comment period.         </SUMMARY> <DATE>  DATES:     Interim rule effective December 1, 1994; comments must be received on or before February 1, 1995.         </DATE> <ADDRESS>  ADDRESSES:     Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0859 and be sent to William W.

Background        The Board's Regulation E implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA). The EFTA provides a basic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfer (EFT) systems. Types of transfers covered by the act and regulation include transfers initiated through an automated teller machine (ATM), point-of-sale terminal, automated clearinghouse, telephone bill-payment system, or home banking program. Regulation E establishes restrictions on the unsolicited issuance of ATM cards and other access devices; requires disclosure of terms and conditions of an EFT service; calls for documentation of EFTs through terminal receipts and periodic account statements; provides limitations on consumer liability for unauthorized transfers; and establishes procedures for error resolution.        II. Summary of Amendment        Section 205.9_Documentation of Transfers        Paragraph (a)_Receipts at Electronic Terminals        Under the EFTA, when a consumer initiates an EFT at an electronic terminal, the financial institution must make a written receipt available to the consumer.

text: nullnull      The interim rule eliminates the requirement for a unique number or code, and thus allows institutions to truncate the account or card number disclosed on ATM receipts. With a truncated number, it becomes less feasible for a criminal to duplicate a card with an account number that matches the consumer's PIN. For the consumer's purposes, the printed number would continue to provide enough information for the consumer (and the financial institution) to identify the transaction.  The Board believes that the change will not substantially diminish consumer protections. The purpose of the receipt requirement is to allow consumers to verify transactions. Under the amendment, the receipt will still provide sufficient information to allow the consumer to identify transfers: the date of the transfer; the amount of the transfer; the type of transfer and type of account; the location of the terminal; and identification of any third party to or from which funds are transferred. Using this information, a consumer could match each transaction on the periodic statement with the receipt received at the time the transaction took place. In addition, a consumer would have the necessary information to identify and resolve errors in documentation.  Ordinarily the Board publishes proposed rules for a public comment period before their adoption. In the present case, the Board believes the situation represents a serious fraud problem for consumers and financial institutions, and that it is important to act expeditiously in amending the current rule. The Board believes also that the amendment being adopted will reduce fraud without compromising consumers' ability to identify their EFT transactions at ATMs. Delay in the adoption of this amendment would cause continued losses to consumers and financial institutions, which is contrary to the public interest.  Furthermore, the amendment relieves the restriction that the account number be ``unique,'' and does not require institutions to take any action to implement the amended regulation. Modification of the identification number on the receipt is discretionary to the institution. Thus, the Board finds that good cause exists for the adoption of an interim rule without prior comment, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B)). Accordingly, the Board is adopting an interim rule that takes effect immediately, and publishing that interim rule for public comment for a 60-day period, after which the Board will adopt a final rule that takes into account any comment that may be received.  The amendment to Regulation E set forth below does not expressly refer to truncation of the account number. The Board notes, however, that it plans to codify the permissibility of truncation in the Official Staff Commentary to Regulation E, following the Board's final action on this interim rule. (This amendment of Regulation E supersedes a proposed change under the regulatory review project that was published for comment earlier this year (59 FR 10684, March 7, 1994).)      III. Form of Comment Letters      Comment letters should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0859. The Board requests that, when possible, comments be prepared using a standard ``Courier'' typeface with a type size of 10 or 12 characters per inch. This will enable the Board to convert the text into machine-readable form through electronic scanning, and will facilitate automated retrieval of comments for review. Comments may also be submitted on computer diskettes, using either the 3.5  &rsquo;  &rsquo; or 5.25  &rsquo;  &rsquo; size, in any IBM-compatible DOS-based format. Comments on computer diskettes must be accompanied by a hard copy version.      IV. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act      The amendment to Regulation E will provide more flexibility to financial institutions in complying with the EFT Act requirements for identifying a transaction on receipts provided at electronic terminals.  In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the revision will be reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget after consideration of comment received during the public comment period. Nevertheless, given that the amendment provides for more flexibility in complying with the law, the Board believes there is a negligible impact on the paperwork burden for state member banks and institutions supervised by other agencies.

This amendment is prompted by reports of high pressure turbine (HPT) shaft fractures caused by oil fires that resulted from internal leakage of thirteenth stage compressor discharge air into the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fracture of the HPT shaft, which can result in uncontained release of engine fragments, engine fire, inflight engine shutdown, or possible aircraft damage.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the     Federal Register     on January 24, 1992 (57 FR 2857). That action proposed to require the installation and periodic inspection of temperature indicators (temp tabs) installed on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube, performance of any necessary corrective action, and to require the installation of No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment hardware modifications for certain engines.       On July 19, 1993, the FAA issued a Supplemental NPRM (58 FR 40083, July 27, 1993) that reopened the comment period, due to comments received and the determination that the bearing compartment hardware modifications do not adequately prevent internal leakage of thirteenth stage compressor discharge air into the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment. That Supplemental NPRM proposed to require installation of improved temperature indicators to extend the compliance time for installation of temperature indicators, and to eliminate the requirement to perform No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment hardware modifications, in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992, and ASB No. 6053, Revision 7, dated May 24, 1993.                                                 14 CFR Part 39         <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 91&hyph;ANE&hyph;39; Amendment 39&hyph;9065; AD 94&hyph;23&hyph;03] </RINDOCK>      Airworthiness Directives; Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D Series   Turbofan Engines      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.       </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.         </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that requires installation and periodic inspection of temperature indicators installed on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube and performance of any necessary corrective action.

text: nullnull      Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.   One commenter states that PW JT8D-Std series turbofan engines installed in Boeing 727 series aircraft should be exempt from the requirements of the AD based on the absence of uncontained engine failures over the last 16 years for those engines. The FAA concurs. The FAA has determined that the risk of uncontained engine failures on PW JT8D-Std series turbofan engines installed in Boeing 727 series aircraft has been reducing as newer model engines with improved containment capability have been accumulating an increasing percentage of fleet operating hours. Based on this determination, the FAA has concluded that a mandatory requirement to install the temperature indicators on these engines cannot be justified. Therefore, this final rule has been revised to remove from the applicability PW JT8D-Std series engines.     One commenter states that the repetitive inspections and associated record keeping should be incorporated into the operators' FAA-approved maintenance program. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that it is necessary to keep the repetitive inspections under the AD and separate from the routine-approved maintenance program to distinguish this activity as being critical to flight safety. In addition, this AD represents an interim program until installation of the HPT containment hardware in PW JT8D&hyph;200 series turbofan engines has been accomplished in accordance with AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;10.     Two commenters state that the temp tab installation requirement should be extended beyond the current 90 days. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has provided ample notice of this requirement and extension of the installation grace period will increase the probability of a No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment fire and possible shaft fracture. In addition, this 90 day grace period represents an increase from 65 days proposed in the NPRM.     Two commenters state that the repetitive inspection interval should be changed from 65 hours time in service (TIS) to a longer interval or an interval based on calendar time. The FAA does not concur. Extension of this interval will increase the probability of a No. 4 and 5 compartment fire to an unacceptable level. This interval represents a maximum limit, and shorter intervals can be selected to be consistent with calendar time maintenance schedules.     One commenter states that temp tabs are unreliable and are subject to oil contamination and false indications, and that the program should be delayed until a new indicating method is developed. The FAA does not concur. The temp tab configuration specified in this rule and associated PW SB represent an improved version that incorporates a sealant which is applied over the indicator and prevents oil saturation. In addition, a procedure to determine if oil saturation has occurred is included in the associated PW SB. PW has developed a more costly mechanical pop-up indicator that is resistant to oil contamination. Introduction of this indicator is currently under evaluation and it may be available as an alternate means of compliance at a future date.

text: nullnull      Two commenters state that the cost impact does not take into account the expense of maintaining the temp tab indicators and the costs of troubleshooting false indications, and that, therefore, the total cost estimate for compliance with the AD should be increased to reflect these indirect costs. The FAA does not concur. The economic analysis reflects the direct cost of compliance with the requirements of the AD actions that the FAA has determined are necessary to correct an unsafe condition likely to exist on engines of this type design. The FAA has determined that adherence to the temp tab indicator installation instructions provided in PW SB No. 5944 will allow for reliable installation of the indicators. Once installed correctly, the temp tab indicators will provide warning of potentially catastrophic and costly abnormal engine conditions.   One commenter states that the temp tab indicator part numbers should not be stated in the AD. The commenter maintains that the AD would then still be applicable for improved indicators with new part numbers when they are introduced. The FAA does not concur. A new revision to PW SB No. 5944 would be required to introduce new part numbers for new temp tab indicators, and the FAA may approve the new revision and installation of these new temp tab indicators as an alternative method of compliance.   One commenter states that utilizing oil system condition monitoring and checks should allow for an increased temp tab indicator inspection interval. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that the temp tab indicators are the most effective indicator of No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment overtemperature conditions. However, other oil system checks, such as oil consumption monitoring, breather pressure, and oil pressure, can be used to assist in the troubleshooting process and help identify bearing compartment overtemperature conditions.   One commenter agrees with the rule as proposed.   After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.   There are approximately 2,432 PW JT8D&hyph;200 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,044 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1.5 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $85,883.   The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.   For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:              Authority:     49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.       &sect;39.13       [Amended]       2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:              94&hyph;23&hyph;03 Pratt &amp; Whitney:     Amendment 39&hyph;9065. Docket 91&hyph;ANE&hyph;39.             Applicability:     Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D&hyph;209, &hyph;217, &hyph;217A, &hyph;217C, and &hyph;219 turbofan engines that have not installed high pressure turbine (HPT) containment hardware in accordance with AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;10. These engines are installed on but not limited to McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;80 series and Boeing 727 series aircraft.       Compliance:     Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.   To prevent fracture of the HPT shaft, which can result in uncontained release of engine fragments, engine fire, inflight engine shutdown, or possible aircraft damage, accomplish the following:   (a) Install and inspect one or two temperature indicators, part number (P/N) 810486, or a single or double set of P/N 809129 and P/N 809130 temperature indicators, on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube, as follows:   (1) Install temperature indicators on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube in accordance with Section 2.A.(1) of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992, within 90 days after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD).   (2) Visually inspect temperature indicators within 65 hours TIS of installation. Thereafter, inspect at intervals not to exceed 65 hours TIS since last inspection.   (3) If upon inspection, the color of any temperature indicator window(s) has turned completely black, perform troubleshooting and diagnostic testing and corrective action as required, in accordance with Section 2.A.(2)(c) and (d) or (f) and (g), as applicable, of the Accomplishment Instructions of PW ASB No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992. Prior to returning the engine to service, replace any temperature indicator that has turned black and inspect in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this AD.   (b) For aircraft installations utilizing one P/N 810486 indicator or one set of P/N 809129 and 809130 indicators, and inspection reveals a missing indicator, inspect the remaining temperature indicator, if applicable, to determine if the indicator window has turned completely black. If the indicator window has turned completely black, perform troubleshooting and diagnostic testing, and corrective action as required, in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this AD. If the indicator window has not turned completely black or if there are no additional indicators installed, then install a new indicator in accordance with Section 2.A.(1) of the Accomplishment Instruction of PW ASB No. 5944, Revision No. 2, dated June 8, 1992, prior to return to service, and visually inspect the temperature indicator within 65 hours TIS since installation. Thereafter, inspect at intervals not to exceed 65 hours TIS since last inspection in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this AD.

Model 206A, 206B, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 helicopters, that requires a one-time inspection for cracks in the tail rotor drive shaft hanger bearing support brackets (brackets), and repair or replacement, as necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks in the bend radius of the brackets. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent misalignment of the tail rotor drive shaft, failure of the tail rotor drive shaft system, loss of control of the tail rotor, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 206A, 206B, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 helicopters was published in the     Federal Register     on September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48989). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection for cracks of tail rotor drive shaft hanger bearing support brackets (brackets), and repair or replacement, as necessary.       Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, in the cost/benefit analysis section of the preamble, the average labor rate has been changed from the proposed rate of $55 per work hour to the more current rate of $60 per work hour. This rate change increases the proposed estimated total cost of $1,265,000 by $55,000 to $1,320,000. Additionally, there have been some editorial changes made to the proposal. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with the changes noted. Although the labor rate and, correspondingly, the estimated total cost amounts have been changed to reflect the more current labor rate, these changes have been made to the preamble information and not to the proposed regulatory requirements of the AD. The FAA has determined that the editorial changes made to the regulatory requirements of the rule will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.   The FAA estimates that 5,500 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $120 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,320,000.   The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.   For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``    ADDRESSES    .''

This amendment is prompted by an analysis conducted by the manufacturer, which revealed that failure of a lateral control mixer bracket could result in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 and MD&hyph;11 series airplanes series airplanes was published in the     Federal Register     on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29391). That action proposed to require the installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane.             Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.         Two commenters support the proposal.         Several commenters request that the compliance time for installing the spoiler mixer bracket retainers be extended from the proposed 12 months to 18 or 24 months. These commenters state that such an extension will allow operators to accomplish the installations during a regularly scheduled heavy maintenance visit. This will reduce the impact of non&hyph;scheduled maintenance and removal of aircraft from service, and prevent the consequent inconvenience to the traveling public. The commenters point out that safety will not be compromised by extending the compliance time, since the repetitive inspections of the mixer bracket assembly at intervals of 1,500 cycles, as are currently required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;03, will maintain the structural integrity of the mixer bracket assembly in the interim.                   14 CFR Part 39       <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;26&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9076; AD 94&hyph;24&hyph;03]</RINDOCK>      Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 Series Airplanes, KC&hyph;10A (Military) Airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;11 Series Airplanes        <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.           </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes, KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, that requires the installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane.

text: nullnull      The FAA concurs that the compliance time can be extended somewhat. The   FAA's intent was that the inspections be conducted during a regularly scheduled   maintenance visit for the majority of the affected fleet, when the airplanes would be   located at a base where special equipment and trained personnel would be readily   available, if necessary. Based on the information supplied by the commenters, the FAA   now recognizes that 18 months corresponds more closely to the interval representative of   most of the affected operators' normal maintenance schedules. Paragraph (a) of the final   rule has been revised to reflect a compliance time of 18 months. The FAA does not   consider that this extension will adversely affect safety, since the mandatory repetitive   inspections of the area, as required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;03 will ensure that any discrepancies   will be identified and corrected in the interim.   The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years   in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various   inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to   increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work   hour. The economic impact information below has been revised to reflect this increase   in the specified hourly labor rate.          [    Note:     As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association   (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may   misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability   provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the   AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly   assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes   identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an   airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect   compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an   alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each   AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify   this requirement.]          After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above,   the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the   rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes   will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the   AD.   There are approximately 427 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes   and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA   estimates that 241 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take   approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the   average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $6,497   per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is   estimated to be $1,609,157, or $6,677 per airplane.   There are approximately 114 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design   in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry will be   affected by this AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to   accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.   Required parts would cost approximately $6,497 per airplane. Based on these figures, the   total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes   is estimated to be $307,142, or $6,677 per airplane.   Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S.   operators is $1,916,299. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no   operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no   operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for resource management activities, including biomass removal, timber harvest, fuelbreak construction and wildlife habitat improvement work on the Whale Rock Forest Health Multi-resource Project, involving a total planning area size of about 4,500 acres on the Pacific Ranger District of the Eldorado National Forest. The agency invites written comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. The agency also gives notice of the full environmental analysis and decisionmaking process that will occur on the proposal so that interested and affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was completed in January 1989. The Whale Rock Forest Health Multi-resource Project EIS will tier to the approved Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. Most of the land in the analysis area is identified in the approved Plan as having a general management direction of timber management.          There are no known permits or licenses required to implement the proposed action.    In preparing the EIS, the Forest Service will identify and consider a range of alternatives for this project. The proposed alternatives will include the following tentative alternative themes:           1. No Action    2. Forest Health_timber product, including biomass, management emphasis    3. Forest Health_wildlife management emphasis    4. Forest Health_fuels management emphasis    5. Forest Health_multiple use management emphasis.           These alternatives will consider varying levels and distribution of vegetation manipulation, timber harvest and fuels management. No new specified road construction is anticipated. Road reconstruction needs will include drainage work, clearing and minor realignment. The amount of road reconstruction necessary for this project will vary between alternatives. Harvest prescriptions will include understory removal of both merchantable and sub-merchantable trees, commercial thinning, and fuelbreak construction guidelines. All harvest prescriptions will conform with the California Spotted Owl Sierran Province Interim Guidelines Environmental Assessment and Decision Notice. Adaptive management strategies for the Spotted Owl may be included under certain alternatives where benefits to the spotted owl can be shown, that is, wildlife habitat activities or fuel management activities that are designed to better maintain future management options of the spotted owl by improving or retaining stand components most at risk.

These estimates will be dependent on which alternative is chosen.    Preliminary issues that have been identified during the internal scoping process include:           1. The potential for cumulative watershed effects within the project area.    2. The selection and application of adaptive management strategies to best achieve the habitat needs of the spotted owl.           Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis. The first point is during the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7).    The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from federal, state, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed project. This input will be used in preparation of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes:           1. Defining the scope of the analysis and nature of the decision to be made.    2. Identifying the issues and determining the significant issues for consideration and analysis within the EIS.    3. Defining the proper interdisciplinary team make-up.    4. Determining the effective use of time and money in conducting the analysis.    5. Identifying potential environmental, technical, and social impacts of the EIS and alternatives.    6. Determining potential cooperating agencies.    7. Identifying groups or individuals interested or affected by the decision.           Robert Harris, Acting Forest Supervisor, Eldorado National Forest, is the responsible official.    The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public review by June 1994. At that time EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in the     Federal Register    . The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date that EPA's notice of availability appears in the     Federal Register.        The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers's position and contentions.     Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.     v.     NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978).     Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact statement stage, but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts.     City of Angoon     v.     Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986)     and     Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.     v.     Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980).    Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement.    To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.    After the comment period ends on the draft EIS, the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in prearing the final EIS. The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by October 1994. In the final EIS the Forest Service is required to respond to the comments and responses received (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will considered the comments, responses, and enviornmental consequences discussed in the draft EIS; and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making a decision regarding this project. The responsible official will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal pursuant to 36 CFR part 215.

See     CEC Electrical Manufacturing (Int'l) Company Ltd.     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 94&hyph;2 (CIT January 5, 1994). The remand resulted in a finding of a     de minimis     margin for CEC Electrical Manufacturing (International) Company, Ltd./CEC Industries (Shenzhen) Ltd./CEC (USA) Texas Group, Inc. (``CEC'') and, consequently, a negative determination of sales at less than fair value for the investigation of CEC. Therefore, CEC is excluded from the application of the antidumping duty order on ceiling fans from the People's Republic of China (``PRC''). Because CEC is excluded from the application of the antidumping duty order, we are also terminating both ongoing administrative reviews with respect to CEC. In addition, the exclusion of CEC results in a change in the all others rate.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background:       On June 5, 1991, the Department published its Preliminary Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China (56 FR 25664). In that determination, the Department found CECs weighted-average dumping margin for the ceiling fans class or kind of merchandise to be 0.37 percent,     de minimis.     (CEC was not identified as a producer or exporter of products within the oscillating fans class or kind of merchandise.) However, in the final determination the Department found CEC's weighted-average dumping margin for the ceiling fans to be 2.70 percent. See Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China, 56 FR 55271 (October 25, 1991). Consequently, we instructed the U.S. Customs Service to begin suspension of liquidation of all entries of ceiling fans manufactured by CEC entered into U.S. Customs territory on or after October 25, 1991, the date of publication of the final determination. On December 9, 1991, the Department published an amendment to its final determinations, and antidumping duty orders in this proceeding. See Antidumping Duty Orders and Amendments to Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China, 56 FR 64240 (December 9, 1991) (``Fans LTFV Final and Order'').   CEC instituted an action at the CIT challenging the Department's final less-than-fair-value determination.    1         See CEC Electrical Manufacturing (Int'l) Company Ltd.     v.     United States,     Court No. 92&hyph;01&hyph;0014 (``    CEC Electrical    ''). On December 7, 1992, the Department filed a motion before the CIT for voluntary remand in     CEC Electrical,     and on December 8, 1992, the CIT granted the Department's request. Pursuant to the court's order granting voluntary remand, on May 14, 1993, the Department presented to the court the     Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant To Grant Of Voluntary Remand: CEC Electrical Manufacturing Company Ltd.     v.     United States     (``    Voluntary Remand    '').               1      A second respondent involved in the original investigation, Holmes/Esteem, instituted a separate challenge before the CIT challenging the Department's final determination.     Holmes Products Corp. &amp; Esteem Industries, Ltd.     v.     United States,     Court No. 91&hyph;12&hyph;00906. That action has been resolved.     See Oscillating Fans from the People's Republic of China: Notice of Court Decision, Retroactive Revocation of Antidumping Duty Order, and Termination of Administrative Review,     58 FR 30026 (May 25, 1993). As a result of the Department's May 25, 1993, action, the scope of these proceedings has been reduced to a single class or kind of merchandise: ceiling fans.         In that remand redetermination, the Department considered four issues raised by CEC. These were:          1. Double-counting of certain inputs in the downrod assembly;   2.

CEC instituted an action at the CIT challenging the Department's final less-than-fair-value determination.    1         See CEC Electrical Manufacturing (Int'l) Company Ltd.     v.     United States,     Court No. 92&hyph;01&hyph;0014 (``    CEC Electrical    '').

United States     (``    Voluntary Remand    '').               1      A second respondent involved in the original investigation, Holmes/Esteem, instituted a separate challenge before the CIT challenging the Department's final determination.

text: nullnull      3. Misreported price of a specific input for one fan model; and   4. The Department's use of surrogate equivalents for certain inputs.          Regarding issues one and two, the Department determined that double-counting had occurred in both instances in the     Fans LTFV Final and Order.     For the remand redetermination we eliminated all such double-counting. Regarding issue three, we corrected the misreported price. Finally, issue four involves CEC's challenge of certain applications of surrogate data in valuing factors of production. CEC claimed that the Department is required to adjust surrogate data for such factors as: the number of fan blades; the size of the fan; and variations in packing materials. In the remand redetermination we rejected CEC's arguments. The basis for our rejection is that section 773(c)(1) of the Act provides for valuation of factors of production on the ``best available information'' from an appropriate surrogate country, not on the basis of perfectly conforming information. Therefore, we maintained that we were not required to make the adjustments CEC requested. The Department's redetermination on remand was affirmed by the CIT on January 5, 1994. See     CEC Electrical Manufacturing (Int'l) Company Ltd.     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 94&hyph;2 (CIT January 5, 1994).   As a result of these three modifications to our antidumping duty calculations, the final weighted-average dumping margin for CEC is 0.37 percent, and is, therefore,     de minimis,     pursuant to   section 353.6(a) of the Department's regulations. Consequently, our final less-than-fair-value determination for CEC is negative.       Exclusion From the Application of the Antidumping Duty Order, in Part      Pursuant to section 735(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.21(c), we are excluding CEC from the application of the antidumping duty order on imports of ceiling fans. However, if the Department has reasonable cause to believe or suspect at any time during the existence of the antidumping duty order that CEC has sold or is likely to sell the subject merchandise to the United States at less than its foreign market value, the Department may institute an administrative review of CEC under section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.   Because CEC obtained an injunction during the court proceeding, the effective date of the exclusion is retroactive to October 25, 1991, the publication date of the Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China, and the date we began suspension of liquidation for entries of CEC ceiling fans from the PRC.       Termination of Administrative Reviews      Since publication of the     Fans LTFV Final and Order,     the Department has initiated, pursuant to section 751 of the Act, first and second administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order. Those reviews are investigating imports of subject merchandise during the respective review periods by CEC (as well as other producers). (See our published notices of initiation of administrative reviews, 58 FR 11026 (February 23, 1993) and 59 FR 2593 (January 18, 1994), respectively.) Because we are retroactively excluding CEC from the application of this antidumping duty order, we are also hereby terminating both administrative reviews with regard to imports by CEC.       Termination of Suspension of Liquidation      Pursuant to section 516(e)(2) of the Act, the Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation of ceiling fans from the PRC, entered or withdrawn for consumption on or after October 25, 1991, by CEC and to proceed with liquidation of the subject merchandise, which entered the United States on or after that date without regard to antidumping duties. Additionally, the Department will instruct U.S. Customs Service to release any bond or other security with respect to entries of subject merchandise, pursuant to section 735(c)(3)(B) of the Act.       Change in All Others Rate      The exclusion of CEC changes the all others antidumping rate from 2.05 to 1.65 percent, which is the rate of the only remaining company from the investigation (Wing Tat Electric Manufacturing Co., Ltd./China Miles Co., Ltd.) with a margin above     de minimis.     The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to begin collecting antidumping duty deposits equal to   1.65 percent of the entered value of the subject merchandise from all other producers/exporters, effective January 15, 1994.

Scope of Order         For purposes of this investigation, defrost timers are electro-mechanical and electronic defrost timers for residential refrigerators. Electro-mechanical defrost timers are comprised of several components that make or break electric circuits by activating two sets of electrical contact points_one to disconnect the compressor (the cooling mechanism) and the other to connect the defrost heater. The articles are equipped with a synchronous or subsynchronous motor. The defrost timer disconnects the compressor by opening an electrical circuit after the compressor itself has run for a length of time predetermined by the manufacturer depending on the specifications of the model. Upon completion of the compressor run cycle (and simultaneously with the compressor's disconnection) the defrost heater is activated and runs for a preset time (again depending on the model), as predetermined by the manufacturer. Electronic defrost timers have a similar function but operate with greater efficiency. This is because a microprocessor in the device uses   information gathered during the defrost cycle to adjust the compressor run time. This system defrosts only when needed, thereby improving the efficiency of the refrigerator.     The defrost timers subject to this investigation are currently classifiable under subheading 9107.00.4000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.         Antidumping Duty Order        On February 22, 1994, the International Trade Commission notified the Department, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) that imports of defrost timers from Japan materially injure the U.S. industry. Therefore, in accordance with section 736 of the Act, the Department will direct Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority pursuant to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all entries of defrost timers from Japan. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of defrost timers from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 24, 1993, the date on which the Department published its preliminary determination notice in the     Federal Register     (58 FR 44655). On or after the date of publication of this notice in the     Federal Register    , Custom officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties, the following cash deposits for the subject merchandise:        <TABLE>     &blank;      1Manufacturer/producer/exporter   1Weighted-average margin percentage          Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co.

text:   SUMMARY:     On November 18, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of the administrative review of the antidumping duty order on mechanical transfer presses from Japan. The review covers four manufacturers/exporters of subject merchandise to the United States and the period February 1, 1992, through January 31, 1993. We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from the petitioner and two respondents. Based on our analysis, we have changed the final results from those presented in the preliminary results of review.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:        Background        On November 18, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the     Federal Register     (58 FR 60843) the preliminary results of the third administrative review of the antidumping duty order on mechanical transfer presses (MTPs) from Japan (55 FR 5642, February 16, 1990). The Department has now completed the review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).         Scope of the Review        Imports covered by the review include MTPs currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 8462.99.0035 and 8466.94.5040. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and for U.S. Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.     The term ``mechanical transfer presses'' refers to automatic metal-forming machine tools with multiple die stations in which the workpiece is moved from station to station by a transfer mechanism designed as an integral part of the press and synchronized with the press action, whether imported as machines or parts suitable for use solely or principally with these machines. These presses may be imported assembled or unassembled.     This review covers four manufacturer/exporters of MTPs from Japan entered into the United States during the period February 1, 1992, through January 31, 1993. This review does not cover spare and replacement parts and accessories, which were determined to be outside the scope of the order. See ``Final Scope Ruling on Spare and Replacement Parts,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, March 20, 1992. On November 23, 1993, the Department determined that Aida's FMX series cold forging press is within the scope of the order. See ``Final Scope Ruling_Antidumping Duty Order on Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan: Aida Engineering, Ltd.,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, November 23, 1993.

text: nullnull          Comment 1:     The petitioner argues that the Department should have used an exchange rate based on either the date of shipment or the date of entry, instead of employing the exchange rate in effect on the date of sale to the United States, because of the extended time between the sale and shipment of MTPs, and the appreciation of the yen against the dollar during the review period.    Aida and Komatsu state that the Department correctly employed the exchange rate in effect on the date of the U.S. sale, according to the Department's regulations, 19 CFR 353.60, 353.46, 353.49 and 353.50.        Department's Position:     We agree with respondents that we have properly employed the exchange rate that was in effect on the date the merchandise was sold to the United States. According to our regulations and long-standing practice, when the U.S. price is based on purchase price and the foreign market value (FMV) is based on constructed value (CV), the conversion of currency is directly tied to the date the merchandise is sold for exportation to the United States. See 19 CFR 353.60 and 19 CFR 353.50(b)(1).        Comment 2:     Aida states that it is reserving the right to challenge the Department's inclusion of the FMX press within the scope of the order and within the final results of this review.    The petitioner claims that the Department should include home market and U.S. sales of Aida's FMX press and its optional transfer unit in its analysis for these final results, because the Department has determined that the FMX press is within the scope of the order.        Department's Position:     We agree with petitioner. We did not include the FMX press in our preliminary results of review, but stated we would do so in our final results if an affirmative scope determination were made by that time. On November 23, 1993, the Department determined that Aida's FMX cold forging press is within the scope of the antidumping duty order on MTPs. See ``Final Scope Ruling_Antidumping Duty Order on Mechanical Transfer Presses from Japan: Aida Engineering, Ltd.,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, November 23, 1993. We verified the sales and CV data Aida submitted with respect to the FMX press sold in the United States during the review period, and have included this sale in our final analysis.

text: nullnull          Comment 3:     Aida states that, subsequent to verification, it analyzed the year-end warranty cost adjustments discovered at verification, and concluded that only a portion thereof should be allocated to warranty cost. In its case brief, Aida presents a recalculation of the warranty expense factor, and asks that the Department use this revised factor to calculate warranty costs for the final results.        Department's Position:     At verification, the Department discovered that Aida's records indicated an amount for additional warranty costs that Aida had not reported. At that time, Aida claimed that these costs were related to non-subject merchandise, but was unable to satisfactorily document this position. See sales verification report dated October 19, 1993, page 13.    According to 19 CFR 353.31(a)(1)(ii), the time limit for submitting factual information in an administrative review is not later than the earlier of the date of publication of the notice of preliminary results of review or 180 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the review. As Aida submitted its explanation of the additional unreported warranty expenses and recalculation of the warranty expense factor after the date of publication of the preliminary results, this information was untimely submitted. Therefore, we did not consider this information for these final results. As in the preliminary results of review, we used warranty costs as adjusted for the additional costs discovered at verification.        Comment 4:     Aida states that the Department erred in adding related-party commissions on U.S. sales to FMV, and offsetting the commissions by deducting home market indirect selling expenses up to the amount of the commissions. Aida believes that the Department should have treated the commissions as internal transfers, which do not require any adjustment to FMV or offsetting adjustment for indirect home market selling expenses.        Department's Position:     Aida reported commissions to a related party that varied directly with the sale price of an MTP. We verified the commissions paid, and have no reason to believe that these directly related selling expenses were not, in fact, in the nature of commissions. The fact that these commissions were paid to a related party does not change their nature as commissions. Therefore, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a), we are adjusting FMV for the differences in home market and U.S. commissions. Because there were commissions on both U.S. and home market sales, 19 CFR 353.56(b), which calls for an offset when there are commissions in one market but not the other, does not apply.

text: nullnull          Comment 5:     The petitioner asserts that the Department did not evaluate or adjust Aida's transfer prices from a certain related party supplier for such things as direct materials, labor, and/or overhead, as applicable, to reach a fully-loaded cost of production. The petitioner further states that the only adjustment made to the related party inputs was an adjustment made by the Department to include the general and administrative expense of the related supplier.   Aida contends that it made an adjustment for the difference between the transfer price of components purchased from its related party supplier and the related party supplier's cost of manufacturing the components. Aida acknowledges that it inadvertently failed to take into account its related party's processing cost variance and general and administrative expense, but notes that the Department made an adjustment for these, based on verification findings, in its preliminary results.       Department's Position:     We agree with Aida. The Department was able to verify Aida's adjustment to restate related party inputs to fully-loaded costs. Aida's adjustment included direct materials, labor, and overhead. Based on the Department's findings at verification, an adjustment was made to not only general and administrative expenses, but also to the related party's processing variance. (See cost verification report dated October 22, 1993, page 9.)       Comment 6:     Petitioner contends that the Department failed to verify, but should establish, whether transfer prices of inputs acquired by Aida from other related parties were at or above cost.   Aida states that the only material purchased for the subject presses from a related company, other than those from the related party discussed in     Comment 5,     above, consisted of control panels purchased from a partially-owned subsidiary. Aida further states that the reasonableness of the transfer prices used to determine the cost of these components was reviewed and confirmed at verification. With respect to subcontracted work, Aida states that, with the exception of the related party the Department verified, all subcontractors are unrelated.       Department's Position:     We agree with Aida. At verification, the Department analyzed all transactions with related parties. Based on our analysis, we found these transactions to have been made at or above cost. (See cost verification report dated October 22, 1993, page 9.)

text: nullnull          Comment 7:     Komatsu argues that the adjustment that the Department made, in its preliminary results, to costs of subcontracted work performed by a particular related-party supplier, was based on a misunderstanding regarding the method used to calculate costs for that work. In fact, Komatsu claims, in calculating the actual cost of the related-party inputs, it inadvertently overstated the costs by a specific profit percentage. Komatsu contends that, given the above, the costs of the related-party inputs should be reduced rather than increased.       Department's Position:     We disagree with Komatsu. Komatsu did not clearly demonstrate at verification its alleged overstatement of the actual costs of the related-party inputs by a profit margin. Given that the information reviewed at verification indicates an understatement, rather than an overstatement, of costs, an upward adjustment to the value of these related-party inputs for a portion of the period loss incurred by the related party is warranted. (See cost verification report dated October 25, 1993, pages 7 and 8.)       Comment 8:     The petitioner asserts that the Department should increase Komatsu's submitted costs to account for losses incurred by certain other related suppliers during the review period. The petitioner notes that the Department failed to verify the costs of inputs from these suppliers.   Komatsu argues that the amount of Komatsu's purchases from those suppliers was clearly insignificant, as would have been any adjustment the Department might have made.       Department's Position:     We agree with Komatsu. At verification, the Department tested those related party transactions that made significant contributions to the subject merchandise. See cost verification report dated October 25, 1993, page 7. Adjustments to costs for transactions with other related party suppliers, even if warranted, would not have significantly affected the margin analysis.       Comment 9:     Komatsu argues that the Department should allow an offset to the general and administrative expenses for the gains on sales of plant assets recorded at its head office, which relate to the company's general and administrative activities. Komatsu adds that these gains should be offset against the company-wide general and administrative expenses, in addition to the offset the Department allowed for the gain on sales of plant assets at the Komatsu plant.

text: nullnull      Petitioner argues that these gains do not appear to relate to the production operations for subject merchandise, and therefore should be excluded from the general and administrative expenses calculation.       Department's Position:     We agree with the petitioner. During verification, the respondent provided an exhibit that specifically identified the gains that related to the Komatsu plant manufacturing the subject merchandise. (See cost verification exhibit number 29.) No documentation or other support was provided to establish a basis on which to allow an offset for the gains on sales of the other plant assets.         Comment 10:     Aida states that the Department double counted an adjustment it made to the cost variance and general and administrative expenses in applying these adjustments to the CV format for one of the U.S. sales.       Department's Position:     We agree with Aida and have corrected the adjustment to the cost variance and general and administrative expenses.         Comment 11:     Aida states, in its case brief, that the Department made certain clerical errors in its calculations, with respect to inland freight, packing, credit and warranty.       Department's Position:     We agree, and have adjusted our calculations accordingly.       Final Results of Review       As a result of our review, the Department has determined that the following margins exist for the period February 1, 1992, through January 31, 1993:        <TABLE>     &blank;  1Manufacturer/exporter  1Margin (percent)         Aida Engineering, Ltd   3.50   Komatsu Ltd   0.00   Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Ind   10.00   Hitachi-Zosen Corporation   10.00     1No shipments during the period.

The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between U.S. price and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.   Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of review for all shipments of MTPs from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rates for the reviewed companies will be those established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review or the less than fair value (LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation of this case, in accordance with the Court of International Trade's decisions in     Floral Trade Council     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and     Federal Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;83. The all others rate is 14.51 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.   This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.   This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of the return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested.

headline: Polyethylene Terephthalate Film, Sheet, and Strip from Japan; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review 
text:   SUMMARY:     In response to requests from one respondent and one U.S. producer the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet, and strip (PET film) from Japan. The review covers three manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States and the period November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992. We preliminarily determine that margins exist for the period.       Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Background       On June 8, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' (57 FR 24244) of the antidumping duty order on PET film (56 FR 25660, June 5, 1991). On June 30, 1992, one respondent, Toray Industries Inc. (Toray), requested an administrative review and one U.S. producer, Toray Plastics America (TPA) (see Decision Memorandum dated December 28, 1992, regarding Toray's status as a producer in the United States), requested an administrative review for two other Japanese manufacturers/exporters of PET film. We initiated the review on Toray, covering November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992, on July 22, 1992 (57 FR 32521) and the reviews on Teijin, Ltd. (Teijin) and Diafoil Co. Ltd. (Diafoil), on August 26, 1992 (57 FR 38668). The Department has now conducted the review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).       Scope of the Review       Imports covered by the review are shipments of all gauges of raw, pretreated, or primed PET film, whether extruded or co-extruded. The films excluded from the scope of this order are metallized films and other finished films that have had at least one of their surfaces modified by the application of performance-enhancing resin or inorganic layer more than 0.00001 inches (0.054 micrometers) thick. Roller transport cleaning film which has at least one of its surfaces modified by the application of 0.5 micrometers of SBR latex has also been ruled as not within the scope of the order.   PET film is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) subheading 3920.62.00.00. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and for Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.   The review covers three Japanese manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States, Toray, Teijin, and Diafoil, and the period November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992.       Such or Similar Comparisons       As stated in the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, we have determined that the subject merchandise constitutes a single class or kind of merchandise. Each company had sufficient home market sales of PET film to unrelated customers to serve as a basis for calculating foreign market value (FMV).                <RINDOCK>[A&hyph;588&hyph;814] </RINDOCK>       <DOCTITLE>Polyethylene Terephthalate Film, Sheet, and Strip from Japan; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review </DOCTITLE>     <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Import Administration/International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of preliminary results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.          </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     In response to requests from one respondent and one U.S. producer the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet, and strip (PET film) from Japan.

text: nullnull      Best Information Available         Diafoil did not respond to the Department's questionnaire. Therefore, we are using best information available for the purposes of this review. As best information for Diafoil, we preliminarily determine the dumping margin to be 14.00 percent, the highest margin calculated in the original investigation.         United States Price         For Toray, we calculated the United States price based on purchase price as all U.S. sales were made to unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Tariff Act.     For Toray, we calculated purchase price based on f.o.b. Japanese port or delivered U.S. customer prices. We made deductions, where appropriate, for price adjustments (rebates). We also made deductions, where appropriate, for the costs of foreign inland freight, containerization, warehousing, credit expense, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. inland freight in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act.     For Teijin, we calculated purchase price based on f.o.b. Japanese port or delivered U.S. customer prices. We made deductions, where appropriate, for price adjustments (rebates). We also made deductions, where appropriate, for the costs of foreign inland freight and insurance, bank charges, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean freight, warehousing, commissions, credit insurance, indirect selling expenses (U.S. and non-U.S.), inventory carrying charges, other expense, U.S. duty, harbor and U.S. Customs user fees, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. inland freight and insurance in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act.     In addition, for both Toray and Teijin, we made adjustments for the value added tax applied in the home market. On October 7, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), in     Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co.     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition to U. S. price (USP) under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise at the same point the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales.     Federal-Mogul,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 at 12.     The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the     Federal-Mogul     decision. The Department will add to USP the   result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department will also adjust the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV. These adjustments will deduct the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment that are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate the foreign market tax and are included in the United States merchandise price used to calculate the USP tax adjustment and that are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.

text: nullnull      This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the bases for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the amount of tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing more expenses that the price of the foreign market merchandise The Department's policy to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does exceed USP.     Zenith Electronics Corp.     v.     United States,     988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included in FMV.     Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd.     v.     United States,     7609 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustment and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in     Daewoo.             Foreign Market Value         In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of PET film in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating foreign market value (FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales of PET film to the volume of third country sales of PET film, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of Tariff Act. Each respondent had a viable home market with respect to sales of PET film made during the period of review.     For Toray, we calculated the FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. We did not use related party sales because the prices to related parties were determined not to be at arm's length, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.45(a). We made deductions, where appropriate, for rebates and inland freight. We deducted home market packing cost and added U.S. packing costs.     Pursuant to section 353.56, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in claimed warranty expenses, post-sale warehousing expenses, credit expenses, and credit interest revenue.     We made a difference-in-merchandise adjustment, where appropriate, based on differences in the variable costs of manufacture.     For Teijin, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated and three related customers in the home market. These related party sales were determined to be at arm's length, in accordance with section 353.45(a) of our regulations. We made deductions, where appropriate, for rebates, inland freight, and insurance. We deducted home market packing cost and added U.S. packing costs.     Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in post-sale warehousing expenses, and credit expenses.

text: nullnull      For both Toray and Teijin, in order to simplify analysis, we decided to test the home markets sales to determine whether we could use annual FMVs as a basis of comparison to U.S. sales. To determine whether a period of review (POR) weighted-average price was representative of the transactions under consideration we performed a three-step test.     We first compared the monthly weighted-average home market price for each model with the weighted-average POR price of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than plus or minus ten percent from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this test for each model. We then compared the volume of sales of all models of whose POR weighted-average price did not vary more than plus or minus ten percent from the monthly weighted-average price from the total volume of sales. If the POR weighted-average price of at least 90 percent of sales did not vary more than plus or minus ten percent from the monthly weighted-average price, we consider the POR weighted-average price to be representative of the sales under consideration. Finally, we tested whether there was any correlation between fluctuations in price and time for each model. Where the correlation was less than 0.05 (where a coefficient approaching 1.0 indicates a direct relationship between price and time), we concluded that there was no significant relationship between price and time. Since home market prices of both companies passed all of these tests we used annual FMV's as a basis of comparison for both companies.         Preliminary Results of the Review         As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine that the following margins exist for the period November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992:      <TABLE>       &blank;    1Manufacturer/producer/exporter   1Margin   (percent)           Toray   4.76   Diafoil   14.00   Teijin   5.73      </TABLE>       Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted no later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice.

The Department will subsequently publish the final results of   this administrative review, including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments or a hearing.     The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion of this review.     Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of our final results of review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after that publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act:     (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be those rates established in the final results of this review;     (2) The cash deposit rate for subject merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered in previous reviews or in the original LTFV investigation will be based upon the most recently published rate in a final result or determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate;

On March 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in     Floral Trade Council     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and     Federal-Mogul Corporation     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rates is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in the proceeding governed by antidumping duty orders.   Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this review will be   6.32 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the LTFV investigation (56 FR 25660, June 5, 1991).   These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.   This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.   This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.22.            Dated: February 22, 1994.       <SIGNER>  Joseph A.

headline: Titanium Sponge From Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation in Part of the Antidumping Duty Order 
text:   SUMMARY:     On November 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on titanium sponge from Japan and its intent to revoke the order in part. We have now completed this review and found no dumping margin for Showa Denko K.K. (Showa) during the period November 1, 1991 to October 31, 1992. We also determine that Showa has met the requirements for revocation.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Background       On November 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the     Federal Register     (58 FR 63,155) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on titanium sponge from Japan (49 FR 47,053; November 30, 1984). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).       Scope of Review       Imports covered by the review are shipments of unwrought titanium sponge. Titanium sponge is a porous, brittle metal which has a high strength-to-weight ratio and is highly ductile. It is an intermediate product used to produce titanium ingots, slabs, billets, plates, and sheets. During the review period, such merchandise was classified under subheading 8108.10.50.10 of the     Harmonized Tariff Schedule     (HTS). The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.  The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of the subject merchandise to the United States, Showa, and the period November 1, 1991 through October 31, 1992.             <RINDOCK>[A&hyph;588&hyph;020] </RINDOCK>       <DOCTITLE>Titanium Sponge From Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Revocation in Part of the Antidumping Duty Order </DOCTITLE>     <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     International Trade Administration, Import Administration, Department of Commerce.        </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review and revocation in part of the antidumping duty order.          </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     On November 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on titanium sponge from Japan and its intent to revoke the order in part.

text: nullnull      Analysis of Comments Received         We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received a written comment from the respondent, Showa.         Comment 1:     Respondent argues that the Department should use Showa's reported general and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses in its calculation of constructed value. Instead, in its preliminary results of review, the Department allocated Showa's, the parent company, G&amp;A costs to Showa Titanium (STIC) based on the ratio of Showa's equity ownership in STIC to Showa's total equity. The respondent maintains that its methodology for calculating G&amp;A expense in this review is in accordance with its books and records, and is consistent with Showa's reporting in previous review periods. Moreover, in both the fourth and fifth reviews, the Department specifically rejected petitioner's arguments that Showa's reported G&amp;A expense should be recalculated. However, should the Department choose to reverse its position and reject Showa's internal allocation methodology, it should allocate Showa's headquarters G&amp;A based on cost of goods sold, following the Department's established allocation methodology.         Department's Position:     The respondent's submitted G&amp;A costs included STIC's G&amp;A expenses and a portion of Showa parent company G&amp;A expenses allocated to STIC based on a formula used in its ordinary course of business. As a result, we recalculated constructed value utilizing Showa's submitted G&amp;A allocation methodology, which had no effect on the margin.         Final Results of Review         As a result of our comparison of United States price to foreign market value, as discussed in the preliminary results of this review, we determine the dumping margin to be:        <TABLE>     &blank;      1Manufacturer/exporter   1Time period   1Margin (percent)           Showa Denko K.K   11/1/91&hyph;10/31/92   Zero (0).   </TABLE>        Based on information submitted by Showa during this and two previous reviews (    See Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Titanium Sponge from Japan     (58 FR 18,202; April 8, 1993), and     Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review on Titanium Sponge from Japan     (57 FR 9,688; March 20, 1992)), we further determine that Showa has met the requirements for revocation set forth in sections 353.25(a) and 353.25(b) of the Department's regulations. Showa has demonstrated three consecutive years of sales at not less than foreign market value and has submitted the required certifications. On the basis of no sales at less than foreign market value for a period of three consecutive years, an agreement by Showa to immediate reinstatement of the order if it should make such sales in the future, and the lack of any indication to the contrary, the Department concludes that Showa is not likely to sell subject merchandise at less than foreign market value in the future. Therefore, the Department is revoking the order with respect to Showa.    The Department will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to antidumping duties, all shipments of this merchandise entered by Showa on or after November 1, 1991 and on or before October 31, 1992. The Department also will instruct Customs to terminate suspension of liquidation and to cease collecting cash deposits with regard to Showa.

headline: Public Meeting
text:   SUMMARY:     Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Policy, Planning and Program Evaluation will hold two stakeholder meetings to gather comments on a draft report titled ``Energy Infrastructure of the United States and Projected Siting Needs: Scoping Ideas, Identifying Issues and Options; Draft Report of the Department of Energy Working Group on Energy Facility Siting to the Secretary.'' This report was noticed for public comment in the     Federal Register     on December 16, 1993; the public comment period has been extended to April 30, 1994, as noticed in the     Federal Register     on February 4, 1994.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The U.S. Department of Energy issued on December 16, 1993 this draft report and an accompanying documentation summary under the authority provided by the Department of Energy Organization Act. The draft report is the result of over a year-long effort on behalf of staff representing DOE's various subdivisions reflecting diverse expertise and knowledge. The report examines the possible need for expanding the nation's energy infrastructure, and issues related to that potential growth, based on projections of energy supply and demand developed by the Energy Information Administration, with the goal of developing appropriate policy direction for the Department.        The agenda for each stakeholder meeting will cover topics such as siting needs, siting problems and constraints, the ideas presented in the draft report, and constructive roles for the Department of Energy and other federal agencies in improving energy facility siting processes. The meetings will be structured to elicit individual views, not to reach consensus. Members of the general public are invited to observe the meetings and offer comment during a portion of the agenda, within space and time constraints. The views expressed at the meetings will be considered in preparing the final report.

text: nullnull                 <RINDOCK>[Project No. 2069&hyph;003]</RINDOCK>        Arizona Public Service Company; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings and Site Visit          February 24, 1994.        The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for relicense of the existing Childs Irving Hydroelectric Project, Project No. 2069&hyph;003. The project is located on Fossil Creek, a tributary of the Verde River, in Yavapai and Gila counties, Arizona. The project is entirely within the Coconino and Tonto National Forests, administered by the U.S. Forest Service (Forest Service).    The FERC staff, in cooperation with the Forest Service, intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on this hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.    The EA will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial, and engineering analysis.    The FERC staff will issue and circulate a draft EA for review by all interested parties. The staff will analyze and consider all comments filed on the draft EA in a final EA. The staff will then present its conclusions and recommendations to the Commission for consideration in reaching its final licensing decision.        Scoping Meetings        The FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings on March 15, 1994. A scoping meeting oriented toward the agencies will be held at 9:30 a.m. at the Cliff Castle Best Western, 333 Middle Verde Road, Camp Verde, Arizona. A scoping meeting oriented toward the public will be held at 7 p.m. at the Cliff Castle Best Western.    Interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend either or both meetings and help the staff identify the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EA.    To help focus discussions at the meetings, the staff will mail a Scoping Document 1, outlining subject areas to be addressed in the EA to agencies and interested individuals on the FERC mailing list. Copies of Scoping Document 1 will also be available at the scoping meetings.        Objectives        At the scoping meetings the FERC staff will: (1) Identify preliminary environmental issues related to the project; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (3) identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EA; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EA, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staff preliminary views.        Procedures        A court reporter will record the meetings and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the formal record of the Commission proceedings on the Childs Irving Project. Individuals representing statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record.    Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the meetings and define and clarify issues to be addressed in the EA.    Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meetings. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed with Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, until April 15, 1994.    All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Childs Irving Project, FERC Project No. 2069&hyph;003.    Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party or interceder files comments or documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency.        Site Visit        A site visit to the Childs Irving Hydro Project is planned for March 16, 1994. Those who wish to attend should plan to meet at the Cliff Castle Best Western at 8 a.m. or contact Ken Anderson at the Beaver Creek Ranger District, Coconino National Forest, (602) 567&hyph;4501 for details.

(Granite State) submitted for filing with the Commission Third Revised Sheet No. 22 in its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, containing changes in rates for effectiveness on February 1, 1994.     According to Granite State, it was authorized to collect a special volumetric surcharge of $0.0043 per Dth in its rates to reimburse it for $200,000 for costs incurred in acquiring a supply of Canadian gas for its system. Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc., 61 FERC 61,335 (1992). It is further said that Granite State began collecting the surcharge in its rates for sales to Bay State Gas Company (Bay State) and Northern Utilities, Inc.

headline: Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co.; Notice of Request Under Blanket Authorization
text: nullnull           <RINDOCK>[Docket No. RP94&hyph;139&hyph;000]</RINDOCK>         <DOCTITLE>Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co.; Notice of Request Under Blanket Authorization</DOCTITLE>        February 24, 1994.        Take notice that on February 18, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), filed a request for a one-time waiver of the requirements of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1 (tariff), so as to allow any shipper to change its method of fuel reimbursement effective April 1, 1994.    Williston Basin states that its tariff allows shippers to change its election of the method to be used to reimburse Williston Basin for fuel use, lost and unaccounted for gas on the dates Williston Basin revises its fuel reimbursement rate (February 1 and August 1 of each year) pursuant to Section 38 of the General Terms and Conditions of such Tariff. Since this was the shippers' first opportunity to make such a change in its election and due to certain shippers' confusion over the implementation dates of the fuel reimbursement election, Williston Basin herewith seeks a one-time waiver of its tariff requirements to allow any and all shippers the one-time opportunity to change its method of fuel reimbursement effective April 1, 1994. Any such changes made effective pursuant to this waiver would be effective from April 1, 1994, forward until changed in accordance with Section 38 of the General Terms and Conditions of Williston Basin's Tariff. Williston Basin will post this one-time waiver of its tariff on its Electronic Bulletin Board and notify each shipper via written correspondence.    Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).

The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Office of Water            Title:     Information Collection Request for Combined Sewer Overflow Policy (EPA No. 1680.01).        Abstract:     This is a new collection of information in support of the 1993 Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Policy, a national guidance that was issued earlier as a draft Policy in 1992, and is partially based on the 1989 Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Strategy, as published at 54 FR 37370. The Clean Water Act (CWA), as promulgated at 40 CFR Parts 121 through 125, provides the authority to regulate Combined Sewer Systems (CSSs) as point sources subject to National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements. CSSs are wastewater collection systems designed to transport both wastewater and stormwater to publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs). CSSs may periodically experience flows that exceed capacity, resulting in discharges of untreated wastes into surface waters. The CSO policy requires POTWs to provide information to EPA, or the delegated State authority, that will be used to ensure the adequacy of existing CSO controls, to establish permit terms and conditions, to track performance, and to conduct compliance assessment and enforcement of CWA requirements.    Under the CSO Policy, municipal POTWs are expected to document the implementation of nine control measures develop a Long Term CSO Control Plan (LTCCP), and perform ongoing compliance monitoring. The information provided by CSOs may include: 1) operation and maintenance plans; 2) revised sewer-use ordinances for industrial users; 3) infiltration/inflow studies; 4) descriptions of pollution prevention programs; 5) public notification plans; 6) facility plans for maximizing the capabilities of existing collection, storage and treatment systems; 6) contracts and schedules for minor construction programs; and 7) information or data relevant to assessing the extent to which the nine minimum controls satisfy water quality standards.    Documentation, monitoring and reporting by POTWs will occur over the normal five year duration of their NPDES permit. POTWs will be required to retain records for a period of three years.        Burden Statement:     Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 565 hours per response for POTWs and 1,052 hours for States operating NPDES programs including time for reviewing the policy, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the information. Annual public recordkeeping is estimated to average 25 hours per POTW and 6 hours for each State operating an NPDES program.        Respondents:     Municipal POTWs and States operating NPDES programs.        Estimated number of respondents;     1100 POTWs, 30 States.        Estimated number of responses per respondent:     1.        Frequency of Collection:     Twice every five years.

headline: Alabama: Final Determination of Adequacy of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program
text:   SUMMARY:     Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule governing such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in State/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.      Alabama applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA Region IV reviewed Alabama's MSWLF application and made a tentative determination of adequacy for those portions of the MSWLF permit program that are adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF criteria. After reviewing all comments received, EPA today is granting final approval to Alabama's partial program.              SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:              A. Background         On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.   EPA intends to propose in STIR to allow partial approval if: (1) The Regional Administrator determines that the State/Tribal permit program largely meets the requirements for ensuring compliance with part 258; (2) changes to a limited narrow part(s) of the State/Tribal permit program are needed to meet those requirements; and (3) provisions not included in the partially approved portions of the State/Tribal permit program are a clearly identifiable and separable subset of part 258. As provided in the October 9, 1991, municipal landfill rule, EPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October 9, 1993. Consequently, any portion of the Federal Criteria that are not included in an approved State/Tribal program by October 9, 1993 apply directly to the owner/operator without any approved State/Tribal flexibility. On October 1, 1993, the October 9, 1993, effective date was extended for certain smaller landfills and for certain landfills receiving waste from flood disaster areas (58 FR 51536). The effective date is now April 9, 1994, for MSWLFs that accept less than 100 tons of waste per day, are not a Superfund National Priority List site, and are either in a State that has submitted an application to EPA for approval before October 9, 1993, or are located on Tribal lands. The effective date has been extended to October 9, 1995, for very small (less than 20 tons of waste per day), remote landfills in arid climates that lack a practicable alternative for waste disposal or experience significant disruption of surface transportation. Certain large facilities receiving waste from flood disaster areas also are allowed an extension of the compliance date if the State determines that they are needed to dispose of flood debris. The requirements of the STIR, if promulgated, will ensure that any mixture of State/Tribal and Federal rules that take effect will be fully workable and leave no significant gaps in environmental protection. These practical concerns apply to individual partial approvals granted prior to the promulgation of the STIR. Consequently, EPA reviewed the program approved today and concluded that the State/Tribal and Federal requirements mesh reasonably well and do not leave significant gaps. Partial approval would allow the Agency to approve those provisions of the State/Tribal permit program that meet the requirements and provide the State/Tribe time to make necessary changes to the remaining portions of its program. As a result, owners/operators will be able to work with the State/Tribal permitting agency to take advantage of the flexibility allowed under the Federal criteria for approved states for those portions of the State's program that have been approved.         EPA will review State/Tribal requirements to determine whether they are ``adequate'' under section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.  EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. EPA also is requesting States/Tribes seeking partial program approval to provide a schedule for the submittal of all remaining portions of their MSWLF permit programs. EPA notes that it intends to propose to make submissions of a schedule mandatory in the STIR.  As a State's/Tribe's regulations and statutes are amended to comply with the Federal MSWLF landfill regulations, unapproved portions of a partially approved MSWLF permit program may be approved by the EPA. The State/Tribe may submit an amended application to EPA for review and an adequacy determination will be made using the same criteria as for the initial application. This adequacy determination will become effective sixty (60) days following publication if no adverse comments are received. If EPA receives adverse comments on its adequacy determination, another     Federal Register     notice will be published either affirming or reversing the initial decision while responding to the public comments.       B. State of Alabama      On July 9, 1993, the State of Alabama submitted a final application for partial program adequacy determination for their MSWLF permit program. On December 17, 1993, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Alabama's program except for the Financial Assurance Criteria set forth in Subpart G. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 65982, (December 17, 1993).  Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and the date of a public hearing on the application. Region IV of EPA held a public hearing on February 10, 1994, at 7 p.m. in Montgomery, Alabama.  The State of Alabama has the authority to issue permits that incorporate all the requirements of the Revised Federal MSWLF Criteria, except Financial Assurance, to all MSWLFs in the State, with the exception of those located on Tribal Lands.   The EPA has determined that the State of Alabama's statutes and administrative regulations provide for a state-wide comprehensive program of solid waste management including specific provisions for public participation, compliance monitoring and enforcement.   The State of Alabama requested approval for all portions of the Federal criteria except Subpart G&hyph;Financial Assurance Criteria. The Alabama Department of Environmental Management does not currently have statutory authority to develop and enforce financial assurance regulations for MSWLFs. The schedule that Alabama submitted indicates that the necessary changes to the laws, regulations, and guidance to comply with the remaining part 258 requirements will be completed by January, 1995.         C. Public Comment      One written comment was submitted during the public comment period. The commenter supported the tentative decision to partially approve Alabama's MSWLF permit program. There were no written or oral comments submitted during the public hearing.         D. Decision      After reviewing the public comments submitted in response to the tentative decision, I conclude that Alabama's application for partial program adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Alabama is granted a partial program determination of adequacy for all portions of its MSWLF permit program except Subpart G&hyph;Financial Assurance Requirements. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).   This action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the     Federal Register    . All of the requirements and obligations in the State's program are already in effect as a matter of State law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements that the regulated community must begin to comply with. Nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as Federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to give notice prior to making its approval effective.        Compliance with Executive Order 12866       The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.        Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act       Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This action, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that facilities comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.   EPA intends to propose in STIR to allow partial approval if: (1) The Regional Administrator determines that the State/Tribal permit program largely meets the requirements for ensuring compliance with part 258; (2) changes to a limited narrow part(s) of the State/Tribal permit program are needed to meet those requirements; and (3) provisions not included in the partially approved portions of the State/Tribal permit program are a clearly identifiable and separable subset of part 258. As provided in the October 9, 1991, municipal landfill rule, EPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October 9, 1993. Consequently, any portion of the Federal Criteria that are not included in an approved State/Tribal program by October 9, 1993 apply directly to the owner/operator without any approved State/Tribal flexibility. On October 1, 1993, the October 9, 1993, effective date was extended for certain smaller landfills and for certain landfills receiving waste from flood disaster areas (58 FR 51536). The effective date is now April 9, 1994, for MSWLFs that accept less than 100 tons of waste per day, are not a Superfund National Priority List site, and are either in a State that has submitted an application to EPA for approval before October 9, 1993, or are located on Tribal lands. The effective date has been extended to October 9, 1995, for very small (less than 20 tons of waste per day), remote landfills in arid climates that lack a practicable alternative for waste disposal or experience significant disruption of surface transportation. Certain large facilities receiving waste from flood disaster areas also are allowed an extension of the compliance date if the State determines that they are needed to dispose of flood debris. The requirements of the STIR, if promulgated, will ensure that any mixture of State/Tribal and Federal rules that take effect will be fully workable and leave no significant gaps in environmental protection. These practical concerns apply to individual partial approvals granted prior to the promulgation of the STIR. Consequently, EPA reviewed the program approved today and concluded that the State/Tribal and Federal requirements mesh reasonably well and do not leave significant gaps. Partial approval would allow the Agency to approve those provisions of the State/Tribal permit program that meet the requirements and provide the State/Tribe time to make necessary changes to the remaining portions of its program. As a result, owners/operators will be able to work with the State/Tribal permitting agency to take advantage of the flexibility allowed under the Federal criteria for approved states for those portions of the State's program that have been approved.         EPA will review State/Tribal requirements to determine whether they are ``adequate'' under section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.  EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. EPA also is requesting States/Tribes seeking partial program approval to provide a schedule for the submittal of all remaining portions of their MSWLF permit programs. EPA notes that it intends to propose to make submissions of a schedule mandatory in the STIR.  As a State's/Tribe's regulations and statutes are amended to comply with the Federal MSWLF landfill regulations, unapproved portions of a partially approved MSWLF permit program may be approved by the EPA. The State/Tribe may submit an amended application to EPA for review and an adequacy determination will be made using the same criteria as for the initial application. This adequacy determination will become effective sixty (60) days following publication if no adverse comments are received. If EPA receives adverse comments on its adequacy determination, another     Federal Register     notice will be published either affirming or reversing the initial decision while responding to the public comments.       B. State of Alabama      On July 9, 1993, the State of Alabama submitted a final application for partial program adequacy determination for their MSWLF permit program. On December 17, 1993, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Alabama's program except for the Financial Assurance Criteria set forth in Subpart G. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 65982, (December 17, 1993).  Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and the date of a public hearing on the application. Region IV of EPA held a public hearing on February 10, 1994, at 7 p.m. in Montgomery, Alabama.  The State of Alabama has the authority to issue permits that incorporate all the requirements of the Revised Federal MSWLF Criteria, except Financial Assurance, to all MSWLFs in the State, with the exception of those located on Tribal Lands.   The EPA has determined that the State of Alabama's statutes and administrative regulations provide for a state-wide comprehensive program of solid waste management including specific provisions for public participation, compliance monitoring and enforcement.   The State of Alabama requested approval for all portions of the Federal criteria except Subpart G&hyph;Financial Assurance Criteria. The Alabama Department of Environmental Management does not currently have statutory authority to develop and enforce financial assurance regulations for MSWLFs. The schedule that Alabama submitted indicates that the necessary changes to the laws, regulations, and guidance to comply with the remaining part 258 requirements will be completed by January, 1995.         C. Public Comment      One written comment was submitted during the public comment period. The commenter supported the tentative decision to partially approve Alabama's MSWLF permit program. There were no written or oral comments submitted during the public hearing.         D. Decision      After reviewing the public comments submitted in response to the tentative decision, I conclude that Alabama's application for partial program adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Alabama is granted a partial program determination of adequacy for all portions of its MSWLF permit program except Subpart G&hyph;Financial Assurance Requirements. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).   This action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the     Federal Register    . All of the requirements and obligations in the State's program are already in effect as a matter of State law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements that the regulated community must begin to comply with. Nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as Federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to give notice prior to making its approval effective.        Compliance with Executive Order 12866       The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.        Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act       Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This action, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.               Authority:     This notice of final partial program adequacy determination of Alabama's municipal solid waste permit program is issued under the authority of section 4005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended; 42 U.S.C. 6946.

headline: State of Florida; Adequacy Determination of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program 
text:   SUMMARY:     Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the federal landfill criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.         Florida has applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA Region IV has reviewed Florida's MSWLF application and has made a tentative determination that Florida's MSWLF permit program meets the requirements for full program approval and ensures compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258).     Florida's application for program adequacy determination is available from EPA Region IV and the State for public review and comment. Although, RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve a State's/Tribe's MSWLF program, Region IV has scheduled a public hearing on this determination. The date, location and time of the hearing is discussed below in the     DATES     section. Anyone requiring additional information regarding the hearing, may call the person listed in the     CONTACTS     section below.          null                             <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Environmental Protection Agency.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of tentative determination on Florida application for full program adequacy determination, public hearing and public comment period.           </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258).

As provided in the October 9, 1991 municipal solid waste landfill rule, EPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October 9, 1993. Consequently, any remaining portions of the Federal criteria that are not included in an approved State/Tribal program apply directly to the owner/operator without any approved State/Tribal flexibility. On October 1, 1993, EPA published the Final Rule to extend the effective date of the landfill criteria for certain classifications of landfills (58 FR 51536). On October 14, 1993, EPA published corrections to the Final Rule to extend the effective date (58 FR 53137).

text: nullnull      Florida's revised application includes new regulations which the State developed to be technically comparable to the requirements of the federal criteria. Florida's revised regulations became effective on January 2, 1994, and have been deemed technically comparable to the federal criteria.     Although regulatory language and structure in certain of Florida's regulations may not reflect the exact language and structure in the corresponding EPA requirements, EPA has determined that Florida will ensure compliance with 40 CFR part 258. The following paragraphs detail the major issues for which Florida was required to demonstrate technical comparability.     1. Daily Cover_40 CFR 258.21 requires that six (6) inches of earthen material be placed over the working face of MSWLFs at the end of each working day to control blowing litter, scavenging, etc. Directors of EPA-approved states have the flexibility to allow daily covers made of alternative materials and thicknesses. Florida's regulations previously provided MSWLFs owner/operators an exemption from daily cover if the period between cessation of operation on one day and start of operation the next was 18 hours or less. Florida revised their regulatory language to eliminate this exemption and require daily cover. Florida also added language to allow a reusable tarpaulin (to be rolled out over the working face at the end of one day and taken up at the beginning of the next) as an acceptable alternative to a soil daily cover.     2. Liner Design_40 CFR 258.40 requires that new landfills and lateral expansions to existing landfills be constructed with a specific composite liner and leachate collection system or an alternative which ensures that drinking-water-based maximum concentration limits (MCLs) are not exceeded in the uppermost groundwater aquifer at a predetermined point of compliance (POC). The POC must be on the landfill owner/operator's property and within 150 meters (approximately 500 feet) of the landfill unit boundary.     EPA Headquarters has interpreted the federal criteria to also afford states the opportunity to present alternative liner designs to regional offices for review. If a state demonstrates, via mathematical modelling, that the proposed alternative(s) meet the minimum federal performance standard based on ``worst-case'' conditions (considering hydrology, geology, climate, groundwater flow, etc.), then the EPA regional office can approve the alternative(s) to be used as state standard(s) in lieu of the federal standard composite liner system.     Florida's regulations allow several alternative composite liner designs and a double synthetic liner design with primary and secondary leachate collection systems. Florida has presented information, including analysis data from the MultiMed mathematical modeling program, to adequately demonstrate that each of their liners meets the federal performance standards. Additionally, Florida determines the need for corrective action due to contaminant releases from the landfill into the subsurface based on analysis of groundwater sampled at distances within 100 feet of the landfill unit boundary (as compared to the federal range of 0 to 150 meters (or approximately 500 feet) from the unit boundary). Further, in addition to sampling and analyzing groundwater, Florida performs annual analysis of leachate collected from the landfill, to determine which constituents might be expected to be found in groundwater in the event that a release does occur.     3. Groundwater Monitoring and Corrective Action_40 CFR 258.54 requires detection monitoring for sixty-two (62) constituents. Florida's original detection monitoring program required analysis of fewer and several different constituents than the federal. Florida has revised their regulatory language to include analysis of all constituents listed in 40 CFR part 258.54 in addition to their original parameters.

text: nullnull      4. Final Closure Cover_40 CFR 258.60 requires that a MSWLF final closure cover include a composite cap which consists of a minimum 6 inch earthen erosion/vegetative layer and an infiltration layer of at least 18 inches of soil compacted to a permeability of 1&times;10    ^5     cm/sec or the permeability of the bottom liner system, whichever is less. EPA Headquarters has interpreted this description to imply that MSW landfills with a synthetic in their liner system must be closed with a cap that includes a synthetic in the infiltration layer. Directors of EPA-approved states have the flexibility to allow infiltration layers of alternative materials and/or thicknesses.     Florida's original regulations did not require a synthetic in the final closure cover of a synthetically lined MSW landfill. Florida has revised their regulatory language to require that final closure covers on MSW landfills include ``a barrier layer which is substantially equivalent to, or less than, the permeability of the bottom liner system.'' Florida also specifically requires that, ``If the landfill uses a geomembrane in the bottom liner system, the barrier layer shall also incorporate a geomembrane.''     5. Financial Assurance for Corrective Action_40 CFR 258.73 requires that landfill owner/operators required to undertake corrective action procedures, have financial assurance based on a written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of hiring a third party to perform the corrective action. Florida's original program did not address this issue. Florida has revised their regulatory language to require an acceptable mechanism by which owner/operators must provide financial assurance in the event that corrective action activities are necessary at their facility.     EPA Region IV will consider all public comments on its tentative determination which are received by close of the scheduled public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for Florida's program. EPA Region IV will make a final decision on whether or not to approve Florida's program after all comments are received and reviewed, and will give notice of that decision in the     Federal Register    . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments received by the end of the scheduled public hearing.     Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).         Compliance With Executive Order 12866         The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.         Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act         Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

The charter for the CAAAC was reissued and the Committee was authorized to be extended until November 19, 1994 under regulations established by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).         On August 4, 1993 EPA requested nominations for new members to the committee. In February 1994 all new and reappointed members of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee were contacted and informed of their selection. The membership of the Committee represents a balance of interested persons with diverse perspectives and professional qualifications and experience to contribute to the functions of the Advisory Committee. Members were drawn from: business and industry; academic institutions; state and local governmental bodies; environmental and nongovernmental organizations; unions and service groups.     Fifty-two individuals were selected to participate as members of the CAAAC. The Advisory Committee will be authorized to form subcommittees to consider specific issues or actions and report back to the Committee.         Open Meeting Notice:     Notice is hereby given that the reauthorized Clean Air Act Advisory Committee will hold its initial open meeting on March 29, 1994 from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., at the Washington Renaissance Hotel, 999 9th Street, NW. in Washington, DC. Seating will be available on a first come, first served basis.     The CAAAC was established to advise EPA on the development, implementation, and enforcement of the new and expanded regulatory and market-based programs required by the Clean Air Act of 1990.

headline: Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use Bifenthrin; Solicitation of Public Comment 
text:   SUMMARY:     EPA has received a specific exemption request from the California Environmental Protection Agency (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide bifenthrin [CAS 82657&hyph;04&hyph;3     cis isomer     and CAS 83322&hyph;02&hyph;5     trans isomer    ] to treat up to 200,000 acres of cucurbits (cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash) to control the sweet potato whitefly. In accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.               SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of bifenthrin on cucurbits to control the sweet potato whitefly. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request.         The sweet potato whitefly (SPWF) is a relatively new pest on cucurbits. The SPWF has caused severe economic damage to several other commodities nationwide including cotton, lettuce, squash, beans, peanuts, and ornamentals. SPWF causes damage through feeding activities, and also indirectly through the production of a honeydew, which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SPWF is not being achieved with the currently registered compounds. The Applicant claims that significant economic losses are expected in California cucurbit production if the SPWF is not adequately controlled, and is therefore requesting this use of bifenthrin.     The Applicant proposes to apply bifenthrin at a maximum rate of 0.1 lb. active ingredient (a.i.) (6.4 oz. of product) per acre with up to three applications allowed, and a maximum of 0.3 lb. a.i. per acre per season, on a total of 200,000 acres of cucurbits. It is possible to produce two cucurbit crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the acreage could potentially receive 6 applications, (maximum of 0.6 lb. a.i. per acre) per calendar year. Therefore, use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 120,000 lbs. of active ingredient. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. This is the third time that the Applicant has applied for the use of bifenthrin on cucurbits, and the fourth year that this use has been requested under section 18. The regulations governing section 18 require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the     Federal Register     and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a pesticide if an emergency exemption has been requested or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use and/or a petition for tolerance for residues in or on the commodity has not been submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24(a)(6)].    Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the California Environmental Protection Agency.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to document the analysis and disclose the environmental impacts of proposed actions to salvage harvest timber and improve productivity of stands of trees in portions of the Muddy Creek, Twelvemile Creek, Sixmile Creek, and Ferron Creek Drainages. The project is located approximately 10 air miles southeast of Manti, Utah.           The entire proposal area involves some 30,000 acres of which approximately 10,000 acres is forested with an Engelmann spruce cover type. A bark beetle epidemic has affected the major portion of this type. the need for the proposal is established by the silvicultural condition of the affected timber stands and forest goals as outlined in the Manti-La Sal National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.    Six areas that were inventoried as roadless as part of the RARE II evaluation are adjacent to and in some cases overlap the proposal. These areas were released back to full Multiple Use management by the Utah Wilderness Act and were evaluated for a variety of designations in the Forest's analysis during the Forest Land and Resource Plan process which was completed in 1986. The current analysis will document effects that would substantially alter the undeveloped character of these areas.               SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This EIS will tier to the final EIS for the Manti-La Sal National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan). The Manti-La Sal Forest Plan provides the overall guidance (Goals, Objectives, Standards, and Management Area Direction) to achieve the Desired Future Condition for the area being analyzed, and contains specific management area prescriptions for the entire Forest.             A National forest Management Act Analysis for this proposal was completed in 1993. As a result of that analysis and additional scoping the Manti-La Sal concluded the proposal may have a significant effect on the roadless character of some of the surrounding areas, and because of the scope of the project size it was decided to prepare this EIS. The previous scoping and analysis also identified the following potential issues related to the proposed action:    What will be the effects of the proposal on the habitats, behavior, and local population of certain wildlife species?    What effect will the proposed activities have on the access, quality, and safety of the recreational opportunities of the area?    How will the proposal alter the present visual quality?      What will be the effects of the proposal on cultural resources?    How will potential build up of dead, down, woody, ground fuels be effected by the proposal?    How will the proposal contribute to a healthy, productive forest that will economically provide timber for the market place on a sustainable basis for the present and the future?    What effect will the proposal have on the transportation systems presently serving the area?

text: nullnull      What will be the impacts on wetlands, and riparian areas?  What will the impacts be on the water quality and chemistry?  What will be the economics of the proposed action?  How will the proposal affect the roadless character of certain areas?  How will the local economies be affected by the proposal?  The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State, and local agencies as well as individuals and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by the proposed action. The Forest Service invites written comments and suggestions on the issues related to the proposal and the area being analyzed. Information received will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS and Final EIS. For most effective use, comments should be submitted to the Forest Service within 30 days from the date of publication of this Notice in the     Federal Register    . Preparation of the EIS will include the following steps:           1. Define the purpose of and need for action.  2. Identify potential issues.  3. Eliminate issues of minor importance or those that have been covered by previous and relevant environmental analysis.  4. Select issues to be analyzed in depth.  5. Identify reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.  6. Describe the affected environment.  7. Identify the potential environmental effects of the alternatives.           Steps 2, 3, and 4 will be completed through the scoping process.    Step 5 will consider a range of alternatives developed from the key issues. One of these will be the ``No Action'' alternative. Other alternatives will consider various methods, levels and locations of harvest, regeneration, and related road development/improvement in response to issues, and non-timber objectives.    Step 6 will describe the physical attributes of the area to be affected by this proposal, with special attention to the environmental factors that could be adversely affected.    Step 7 will analyze the environmental effects of each alternative. This analysis will be consistent with management direction outlined in the Forest Plan. The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each alternative will be analyzed and documented. In addition, the site specific mitigation measures for each alternative will be identified and the effectiveness of these mitigation measures will be disclosed.    The approximate boundary of the area covered for this analysis will be from the southern Forest boundary along White Mountain north along Skyline Drive to the Ferron and Sixmile drainages.    The proposed management activities would be administered by the Sanpete and Ferron Ranger Districts of the Manti-La Sal National Forest in Sanpete and Sevier Counties, Utah.    Agency representatives and other interested people are invited to visit with Forest Service officials at any time during the EIS process. Two specific time periods are identified for the receipt of formal comments on the analysis. The two comment periods are, (1) during the scoping process, the next 30 days following publication of this Notice in the     Federal Register    , and (2) during the formal review period of the Draft EIS.    The Draft EIS is estimated to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review in June, 1994. At this time the EPA will publish an availability notice of the Draft EIS in the     Federal Register.

text: nullnull      The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability appears in the Federal Register    . It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (See The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).    In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions.     Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.     v.     NRDC    , 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement.     City of Angoon     v.     Hodel,     (9th Circuit, 1986) and     Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.     v.     Harris,     490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final.    To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns related to the proposed action, comments on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible. Referring to specific pages or chapters of the Draft EIS is most helpful. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1503.3, in addressing these points.)    The final EIS is expected to be released September 16, 1994.    The Forest Supervisor for the Manti-La Sal National Forest, who is the responsible official for the EIS, will then make a decision regarding this proposal, after considering the comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the Final Environmental Impact Statement, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The reasons for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decisions.           Dated: February 17, 1994.       <SIGNER>  George A.

text:   SUMMARY:     In response to requests from interested parties, the Department of Commerce has conducted administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. The classes or kinds of merchandise covered by these orders are ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, and spherical plain bearings. The reviews cover 38 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1992, through April 30, 1993 (the POR). Although we initiated reviews for nine other manufacturers/exporters, we are terminating the reviews because the requests for these reviews were withdrawn in a timely manner. As a result of these reviews, the Department has preliminarily determined the weighted-average dumping margins for the reviewed firms to range from 0.37 percent to 132.25 percent for BBs, from zero to 51.82 percent for CRBs, and from zero to 92.00 percent for SPBs.

text: nullnull      On January 13, 1994, GMN also requested that the Department allow GMN to withdraw its request for review and terminate the review of the order on BBs from Germany with respect to GMN. Although its request to withdraw was submitted well after the deadline for doing so, GMN claimed that the circumstances of the firm's bankruptcy rendered it unable to proceed further with the review. After giving careful consideration to GMN's circumstances, we find that it would be inappropriate to terminate the review. GMN's request to terminate the review was submitted during the verification process, which is an advanced stage of the review process, and at a point at which it had become clear that the company would be unable to complete verification successfully. Furthermore, a domestic interested party objected to termination of the review at that stage. Therefore, we are not terminating the review of GMN.  In addition, we initiated reviews for SST Bearing Corp. (SST), and Peer International (Peer) with respect to subject merchandise from Japan. SST informed us that it neither produced AFBs in Japan nor exported Japanese-produced bearings to the United States. Peer informed us that although it is a reseller of Japanese-made bearings, all of its suppliers had knowledge at the time of sale that the merchandise was destined for the United States. Consequently, Peer is not a reseller as defined in 19 CFR 353.2(s) because its sales cannot be used to calculate the U.S. price. Therefore, we are preliminarily terminating the reviews with respect to SST and Peer. If we obtain any information that contradicts these companies' assertions, we will complete the reviews with respect to these companies.      Best Information Available      In accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, we have preliminarily determined that the use of best information available (BIA) is appropriate for certain firms. The Department's regulations provide that we may take into account whether a party refuses to provide information in determining what is the best information available (19 CFR 353.37(b)). For purposes of these reviews and in accordance with past Commerce practice, we have used the most adverse BIA_generally the highest rate for any company for the class or kind of merchandise from the same country from this or any prior segment of the proceeding, including the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation_whenever a company refused to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impeded the proceeding. When a company substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but failed to provide all information requested in a timely manner or in the form requested, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from the same country from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the class or kind of merchandise from the same country (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order, 58 FR 39728 (July 26, 1993)).  Because Franke &amp; Heydrich, General Bearing Corp., and SNFA failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we have used the highest rate ever found for each relevant class or kind of merchandise and country of origin. Also, because GMN had substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but was unable to complete verification, we used as BIA its highest previous rate, in this case the rate from the LTFV investigation.

Each of these firms also agreed to its immediate reinstatement in the relevant antidumping orders, as long as it is subject to those orders, if the Department concludes under 19 CFR 353.22(f) that, subsequent to revocation, it sold the subject merchandise at less than fair value.  In the two prior reviews of these orders, we determined that SPBs from France sold by SKF, BBs from Germany sold by NTN Kugellagerfabrik and GMN, CRBs from Italy sold by SKF, and BBs, CRBs, and SPBs from Japan sold by Honda were not sold at less than fair value. In this review, we preliminarily determine that these firms, with the exception of NTN Germany and GMN, have not sold these products at less than fair value, which will satisfy the three-year period of no sales at less than fair value, if these preliminary findings are affirmed in our final results. Therefore, we intend to revoke the orders with respect to the following firms and merchandise:         Spherical plain bearings from France_SKF  Cylindrical roller bearings from Italy_SKF  Spherical plain bearings from Japan_Honda  Ball bearings from Japan_Honda  Cylindrical roller bearings from Japan_Honda         With respect to SPBs from Japan sold by NTN and BBs from Germany sold by NTN and GMN, we have not established that there has been a three-year period of sales at not less than fair value. The final results of the previous administrative review indicated the existence of dumping margins on NTN's sales of SPBs from Japan (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order, 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993). In addition, we preliminarily determine in this review that there are dumping margins on NTN's sales of BBs from Germany. Therefore, we do not intend to revoke the orders on SPBs from Japan with respect to NTN or on BBs from Germany with respect to NTN.  Concerning GMN, as BIA, (see ``Best Information Available'' section above), we have preliminarily determined that dumping margins exist on GMN's sales of BBs from Germany during the 1992&hyph;93 review period. Furthermore, on February 10, 1994, the company withdrew its request for revocation. Therefore, we do not intend to revoke the order on BBs from Germany with respect to GMN.      Scope of Reviews      The products covered by these reviews are antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings), and parts thereof (AFBs), and constitute the following ``class or kinds'' of merchandise:  1.     Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof:     These products include all antifriction bearings that employ balls as the rolling element.   Imports of these products are classified under the following categories: antifriction balls, ball bearings with integral shafts, ball bearings (including radial ball bearings) and parts thereof, and housed or mounted ball bearing units and parts thereof.

Imports of these products are classified under the following HTS subheadings: 8483.30.40, 8483.30.80, 8483.90.20, 8483.90.30, 8485.90.00, 8708.99.50.     The size or precision grade of a bearing does not influence whether the bearing is covered by the order. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written descriptions remain dispositive.         United States Price         In calculating United States price (USP), the Department used purchase price (PP) or exporter's sales price (ESP), as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act, as appropriate.     Due to the extremely large number of transactions that occurred during the POR and the resulting administrative burden involved in calculating individual margins for all of these transactions, we sampled sales to calculate USP, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act. When a firm made more than 2,000 ESP sales transactions to the United States for a particular class or kind of merchandise, we reviewed ESP sales which occurred during sample weeks. We selected one week from each two-month period in the review period, for a total of six weeks, and analyzed each transaction made in those six weeks. The sample weeks included May 31&hyph;June 6, 1992; July 26&hyph;August 1, 1992; October 18&hyph;24, 1992; November 22&hyph;28, 1992; February 14&hyph;20, 1993; and April 18&hyph;24, 1993. We reviewed all PP sales transactions during the POR because there were few PP sales.     United States price was based on the packed f.o.b., c.i.f., or delivered price to unrelated purchasers in, or for exportation to, the United States. We made deductions, as appropriate, from PP and ESP for movement expenses, discounts and rebates.     We made additional deductions from ESP for direct selling expenses, indirect selling expenses, and repacking in the United States.     We made an addition to USP for value-added taxes (VAT) in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act. In making our adjustment for VAT, we followed the instructions of the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) in     Federal Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co.     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT October 7, 1993). The Department added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department also adjusted the tax amount calculated for USP and the amount of tax included in foreign market value (FMV). We deducted the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax that are the result of expenses that are included in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and in the United States price used to calculate the USP tax. Because these expenses are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP, these adjustments are necessary to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax from creating dumping margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.     With respect to subject merchandise to which value was added in the United States,     e.g.,     parts of bearings that were imported and further processed into finished bearings by U.S. affiliates of foreign exporters, prior to sale to unrelated U.S. customers, we deducted any increased value in accordance with section 772(e)(3) of the Tariff Act.     Those bearings otherwise subject to the order that are incorporated into nonbearing products, which collectively comprise less than one percent of the value of the finished products sold to unrelated customers in the United States, are not subject to the assessment of antidumping duties. In Roller Chain, Other Than Bicycle, from Japan (48 FR 51801; November 14, 1983), roller chain, which was subject to an antidumping duty order, was imported by a related party and incorporated into finished motorcycles. The finished motorcycles were the first articles of commerce sold by the subject producer to unrelated purchasers in the United States. Because the roller chain did not constitute a significant percentage of the value of the completed product, the Department found that a USP could not reasonably be determined for the roller chain. The Department, therefore, did not assess dumping duties on these transactions. We have applied this same principle to these reviews.         Foreign Market Value         The home market was viable for all companies and all classes or kinds of merchandise. The Department used home market prices or constructed value (CV), as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, as appropriate, to calculate foreign market value (FMV).     Due to the extremely large number of transactions that occurred during the POR and the resulting administrative burden involved in examining   all of these transactions, we sampled sales to calculate FMV, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act. When a firm had more than 2,000 home market sales transactions for a particular class or kind of merchandise, we used sales from sample months that corresponded to the sample weeks selected for U.S. sales sampling plus one contemporaneous month prior to the POR and one following the POR. The sample months included March, June, July, October, and November of 1992, and February, April, and June of 1993.

text: nullnull      In general, the Department relies on monthly weighted-average prices in the calculation of FMV in administrative reviews. Because of the significant volume of home market sales involved in these reviews, we examined whether it was appropriate to average, in accordance with section 777A of the Tariff Act, all of each respondent's home market sales on an annual basis. In this case, the use of POR weighted-average prices results in significant time and resource savings for the Department. To determine whether a POR weighted-average price was representative of the transactions under consideration, we performed a three-step test.     We first compared each monthly weighted-average home market price for each model with the weighted-average POR price of that model. We calculated the proportion of each model's sales whose POR weighted-average price did not vary meaningfully (    i.e.,     was within plus or minus 10 percent) from the monthly weighted-average prices. We did this for each model within each class or kind of merchandise. We then compared the volume of sales of all models within each class or kind of merchandise whose POR weighted-average price did not vary meaningfully from the monthly weighted-average price with the total volume of sales of that class or kind of merchandise. If the POR weighted-average price of at least 90 percent of sales in each class or kind of merchandise did not vary meaningfully from the monthly weighted-average price, we considered the POR weighted-average prices to be representative of the transactions under consideration. Finally, we tested whether there was any correlation between fluctuations in price and time for the home market sales. Where the correlation coefficient was less than 0.05 (where a coefficient approaching 1.0 means a direct relation between price and time,     i.e.,     that prices consistently rise from month to month, and a coefficient approaching zero means no relation between prices and time), we concluded that there was no significant relation between price and time. We calculated a weighted-average POR FMV only for those classes or kinds that satisfied our three-step test for the factors of price, volume, and time.     We compared U.S. sales with sales of such or similar merchandise in the home market. We considered all non-identical products within a bearing family to be equally similar. As defined in the questionnaire, a bearing family consists of all bearings within a class or kind of merchandise that are the same in the following physical characteristics: load direction, bearing design, number of rows of rolling elements, precision rating, dynamic load rating, and outer diameter, inner diameter, and width.     Home market prices were based on the packed, ex-factory or delivered prices to related or unrelated purchasers in the home market. Where applicable, we made adjustments for movement expenses, differences in cost attributable to differences in physical characteristics of the merchandise, and differences in packing. We also made adjustments for differences in circumstances of sale in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56. For comparisons to PP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses and added U.S. direct selling expenses. For comparisons to ESP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses. We also made adjustments, where applicable, for home market indirect selling expenses to offset U.S. commissions in PP and ESP calculations and to offset U.S. indirect selling expenses deducted in ESP calculations, but not exceeding the amount of the indirect U.S. expenses. For comparisons to both ESP and PP sales, we adjusted for VAT using the methodology detailed in the ``United States Price'' section of this notice.     We used sales to related customers only where we determined such sales were made at arm's length,     i.e.,     at prices comparable to prices at which the firm sold identical merchandise to unrelated customers.     Where we found home market sales below the cost of production in the previous administrative review period, we concluded that reasonable grounds exist to believe or suspect that home market sales during the POR were made at prices below the cost of production, and we therefore initiated cost investigations.     In accordance with section 773(b) of the Tariff Act, in determining whether to disregard home market sales made at prices below the cost of production, we examined whether such sales were made in substantial quantities over an extended period of time. When less than 10 percent of the home market sales of a particular model were at prices below the cost of production, we found that substantial quantities of such sales were not made and did not disregard any sales of that model. When 10 percent or more, but not more than 90 percent, of the home market sales of a particular model were determined to be below cost, we determined that substantial quantities of such sales were made and excluded the below-cost home market sales from our calculation of FMV provided that these below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time. When more than 90 percent of the home market sales of a particular model were made below cost over an extended period of time, we disregarded all home market sales of that model from our calculation of FMV and went to CV.     To determine if sales below cost had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in which sales below cost had occurred for a particular model to the number of months in which the model was sold. If the model was sold in three or fewer months, we did not find that below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time unless there were sales below cost of that model in each month. If a model was sold in more than three months, we did not find that below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time unless there were sales below cost in at least three of the months in which the model was sold.     Since none of the respondents has submitted information indicating that any of its sales below cost were at prices which would have permitted ``recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade,'' within the meaning of section 773(b)(2) of the Tariff Act, we were unable to conclude that the costs of production of such sales were recovered within a reasonable period. As a result, we disregarded below-cost sales when the conditions described above were met.

text: nullnull      Home market sales of obsolete merchandise and distress sales were not disregarded in our cost analysis unless there was documented information on the record demonstrating that such sales were outside the ordinary course of trade.     With respect to FAG Germany, we disregarded certain sales reported by the company in its home market database. The disregarded sales pertain to two unrelated German resellers of FAG bearings. Although FAG reported that it did not know whether these resellers sold its bearings in Germany or abroad, we preliminarily determine, based on the following information obtained at verification, that FAG, at a minimum, should have known that the two resellers would export its bearings.     At verification, we found that FAG referred, both orally and in its records, to these resellers as ``indirect exporters.'' We learned that one FAG subsidiary sold to one of these resellers from its export price list, rather than from its domestic price list. Finally, we contacted one of the resellers independently and were told that it only sells in export markets and that its suppliers were aware of this.     During verification, we inquired of other German producers/exporters about potential sales to ``indirect exporters.'' We did not obtain conclusive evidence that reported home market sales were in fact export sales. However, if we obtain additional information indicating that other producers reported home market sales that we ultimately conclude were export sales, we will delete these sales from their home market databases.     In accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, we used constructed value as the basis for FMV when there were no usable sales of such or similar merchandise for comparison.     We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act. We included the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, profit and packing. To calculate CV we used: (1) actual general expenses, or the statutory minimum of 10 percent of materials and fabrication, whichever was greater; (2) actual profit or the statutory minimum of 8 percent of materials, fabrication costs and general expenses, whichever was greater; and (3) packing costs for merchandise exported to the United States. Where appropriate, we made adjustments to CV in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56, for differences in circumstances of sale. For comparisons to PP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses and added U.S. direct selling expenses. For comparisons to ESP sales, we deducted home market direct selling expenses. We also made adjustments, where applicable, for home market indirect selling expenses to offset U.S. commissions in PP and ESP calculations. For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we made further deductions for constructed value for indirect selling expenses in the home market, capped by the indirect selling expenses incurred on ESP sales in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2).

Because sampling prevents calculation of duties on an entry-by-entry basis, we will   calculate an importer-specific     ad valorem     duty assessment rate for each class or kind of merchandise based on the ratio of the total value of antidumping duties calculated for the examined sales made during the POR to the total customs value of the sales used to calculate those duties. This rate will be assessed uniformly on all entries of that particular importer made during the POR. (This is equivalent to dividing the total value of antidumping duties, which are calculated by taking the difference between statutory FMV and statutory USP, by the total statutory USP value of the sales compared, and adjusting the result by the average difference between USP and customs value for all merchandise examined during the POR.)   Where we do not have entered customs value to calculate an     ad valorem     rate, we will calculate an average per-unit dollar amount of antidumping duty based on all sales examined during the POR. We will instruct the Customs Service to assess this average amount on all units included in each entry made by the particular importer during the POR. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion of these reviews.

As noted in those previous final results, these rates are the ``all others'' rates from the relevant LTFV investigations. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative reviews.   This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate   regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period.

headline: Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From Japan; Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews
text:   SUMMARY:     On July 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce published the final results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom. The classes or kinds of merchandise covered by these reviews are ball bearings and parts thereof, cylindrical roller bearings and parts thereof, and spherical plain bearings and parts thereof. The reviews covered 41 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992. Based on the correction of ministerial errors, we are amending the final results with respect to Japanese ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings and spherical plain bearings sold by one company.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Background       On July 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the     Federal Register     the final results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty orders on antifriction bearings (other than tapered roller bearings) and parts thereof (AFBs) from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom (58 FR 39729). The classes or kinds of merchandise covered by these reviews were ball bearings and parts thereof (BBs), cylindrical roller bearings and parts thereof (CRBs), and spherical plain bearings and parts thereof (SPBs). The reviews covered 41 manufacturers/exporters and the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992.   After publication of our final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors from Honda Motor Company concerning the final results for AFBs from Japan sold by Honda.   We agree with one of these allegations and have made the necessary correction. Specifically, Honda had submitted two sets of home market data. Although we had intended in our final results to use only certain portions of each of these datasets, we used the wrong portions in our final results. We have therefore corrected our analysis by using the correct portions of Honda's submitted home market datasets.       Amended Final Results of Reviews       As a result of our corrections of ministerial errors, we have determined the following percentage weighted-average margins to exist for the period May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992:      <TABLE>       &blank;    1Company   1BBs   1CRBs   1SPBs         Honda   0.04   0.16   0.16      </TABLE>     The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.   Because these rates for Honda are less than 0.50 percent and, therefore,     de minimis     for cash deposit purposes, the Department will require a cash deposit of zero for all entries of the above merchandise from Honda.   These deposit requirements are effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice and shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative reviews.   This notice also serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.   This notice is published in accordance with section 751(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675(f)) and 19 CFR 353.28(c).

headline: Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Fresh Garlic From the People's Republic of China 
text: nullnull           <RINDOCK>[A&hyph;570&hyph;831] </RINDOCK>             <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Import Administration, International Trade   Administration, Department of Commerce.       </AGENCY> <DATE>  EFFECTIVE DATE:     February 28, 1994.        </DATE>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Jennifer Stagner or Diane Mazur, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC, 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1673 or 482&hyph;3534, respectively.       Initiation of Investigation      The Petition       On January 31, 1994, we received a petition filed in proper form by the member companies of the Fresh Garlic Producers Association (collectively petitioner). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, the petitioner alleges that fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a United States industry.   The petitioner has stated that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.       Scope of Investigation       The products covered by this investigation are all grades of fresh garlic, whether or not chilled or frozen, and include whole garlic, whole garlic that has been separated into constituent cloves (cracked garlic), and peeled garlic (skin removed), whether or not packed in any substance. The differences between the grades are based on color, size, sheathing and level of decay.   Fresh garlic is used principally as a food product and for seasoning. Fresh garlic, whether or not chilled or frozen, is currently classifiable under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, and 0710.80.9750 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.       United States Price and Foreign Market Value       Petitioner based United States price (USP) on October 1993 invoices from U.S. importers of the subject merchandise from the PRC. In calculating USP, petitioner deducted amounts for the following: U.S. duties, ocean freight, marine insurance, foreign inland freight expenses, brokers' commission, harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees, and commissions charged by the U.S. importers.   Petitioner alleges that the PRC is a non-market economy (NME) country within the meaning of section 773(c) of the Act.   The Department has determined the PRC to be an NME, within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act, in previous cases (see e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Compact Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings and Accessories Thereof from the PRC, 58 FR 37908 (July 14, 1993). In accordance with 771(18)(C) of the Act, that determination continues to apply for purposes of this initiation. In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME determination and provide relevant information and argument on this issue.   Further, because of the extent of central government control in an NME, the Department considers that a single antidumping margin, should there be one, is appropriate for all exporters from the NME. Only if individual NME exporters are free of central government ownership and can demonstrate an absence of central governmental control with respect to the pricing of exports, both in law and in fact, will they be considered eligible for separate, owner-specific deposit rates. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic of China, 58 FR 48833 (September 20, 1993) for a discussion of the information the Department considers appropriate to warrant calculation of separate rates.)   Petitioner based foreign market value on the PRC's factors of production for producing the subject merchandise. To value the factors of production, petitioner used India as a surrogate country. Petitioner argues that India is a country at a comparable level of economic development as the PRC and India is a significant producer of comparable merchandise pursuant to section 773(c)(4) of the Act. Further, India's garlic production is labor intensive and relies on rudimentary agricultural techniques similar to agricultural methods used in the PRC. For purposes of this initiation, we have accepted India as an appropriate surrogate country selection. There appear to be no other countries with comparable economies to the PRC that produce the subject merchandise. In addition, the Department has used India as an appropriate surrogate country selection in other investigations involving merchandise from the PRC.

text: nullnull      Petitioner first attempted to value the factors of production using Indian information. Where this was not possible, petitioner valued the factors of production using the U.S. industry's costs, where it was determined that this provided a reasonable basis upon which to value certain factors of production. Petitioner valued the factors of production of the subject merchandise in the PRC as follows:     &bull;For material costs (seed and fertilizer), petitioner relied on Indian factors based on its foreign market research, using public information whenever possible.     &bull;For most labor costs (seed cracking, field preparation, planting, weed control, fertilization, irrigation, digging, windrowing and harvesting), petitioner relied on an industry expert's estimate of Chinese factors which was based on the expert's knowledge of the Chinese industry and the expert's own experience with nonmechanized garlic production, using public information whenever possible. Petitioner valued such labor costs on the basis of Indian production experience as developed in its foreign market research. For other labor costs related to hauling, sorting, grading, inspecting, and shrinkage, petitioner relied on the U.S. industry's cost-per-pound for these operations.     &bull;Petitioner added an amount for all other manufacturing costs and related overhead equal to 10 percent of direct material and labor costs.     &bull;Petitioner added an amount for shrinkage loss of 7 percent of the cost of production, based on U.S. experience.     &bull;For selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), petitioner used the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of production.     &bull;For profit, petitioner used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of manufacture plus SG&amp;A.     &bull;Petitioner added an amount for packing based on the average, actual experience of the U.S. industry.     Based on petitioner's calculations, the dumping margins range from 266.73 to 376.67 percent. For purposes of this initiation, no adjustments were made to petitioner's calculations.         Initiation of Investigation         We have examined the petition on fresh garlic and have found that the petition meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of fresh garlic from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.         International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification         Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this action and we have done so.         Preliminary Determination by the ITC         The ITC will determine by March 17, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of fresh garlic from the PRC. A negative ITC determination will result in a termination of the investigation; otherwise, the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits.     This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).            Dated: February 22, 1994.         <SIGNER>  Joseph A.

headline: Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Scope Inquiry on Antidumping Duty Order on Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof From Japan 
text:   SUMMARY:     We preliminarily determine that subject forgings are within the scope of the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished or unfinished, from Japan. Interested parties are invited to comment on this preliminary determination.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background         On September 17, 1993, Koyo Seiko Company Ltd. and Koyo Corporation of U.S.A. (Koyo) requested that the Department of Commerce (the Department) issue a ruling that Koyo's imported forgings, including tower forgings, hot forgings, and cold forgings, be found outside the scope of the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from Japan (52 FR 37352, October 6, 1987). The Department initiated its scope inquiry on September 28, 1993, and granted interested parties an opportunity to comment on whether these forgings fall within the scope of the order. We received comments on November 15, 1993, from the petitioner, the Timken Company, and rebuttal comments from Koyo on November 22, 1993. Due to the significant difficulty presented by this scope inquiry, we have determined that it is appropriate to issue a preliminary determination, in accordance with the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.29(d)(3) (1993)).     Koyo requested the scope ruling in response to a change in the U.S. Customs classification of Koyo's imported forgings. At the time of the original investigation, Koyo's imported forgings were classified as forgings under the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) 606.7340. When the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) replaced the TSUS in 1989 and a specific provision for forgings ceased to exist, Koyo classified its forgings as ``semifinished steel'' under HTS 7224.90, and later, based on the advice of a Customs port, as ``steel articles'' under HTS 7326.19. Customs recently examined the subject forgings and informed Koyo that it considers them to be ``parts of tapered roller bearings (TRBs)'' under HTS 8482.99. Customs generally classifies an article as a ``part'' of another article if that is its chief or principal use. Based on this general principle, Customs determined that under the HTS Koyo's forged rings should be classified as TRB parts as long as they are chiefly used for incorporation into TRBs. Although Koyo's scope clarification request was prompted at least in part by the action of Customs, neither classification choices made by producers nor classification decisions made by Customs determine the scope of antidumping duty orders. Rather, the scope of antidumping duty orders is determined by the Department at the time of the original investigation and issuance of an order.     In accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i)(1), in analyzing the scope request in this proceeding, the Department took into account the descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition, the initial investigation, and the determinations of the Department and the International Trade Commission (ITC). The regulations provide that if the Department determines these descriptions are ambiguous, it will further consider the factors provided for under 19 CFR 353.29(i)(2), known commonly as Diversified Products criteria (see     Diversified Products Corp.     v.     United States    , 572 F. Supp. 883 (CIT 1983)).         Analysis         Koyo makes the forgings at issue from bearing grade steel bar, which is sheared, pierced, and extruded into the shape of the forging. The forgings are not machined in any way prior to exportation.                    <RINDOCK>[A&hyph;588&hyph;604]</RINDOCK>         <DOCTITLE>Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Scope Inquiry on Antidumping Duty Order on Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof From Japan </DOCTITLE>       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Import Administration, International Trade Administration,   Department of Commerce.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of preliminary determination of scope inquiry.          </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     We preliminarily determine that subject forgings are within the scope of the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, finished or unfinished, from Japan.

text: nullnull      We note that the term ``forgings'' covers a broad spectrum of products. The Summaries of Trade and Tariff Information (Schedule 6, Volume 4) identifies two basic types of forgings in its description of the product. Open-die forgings are large shapes produced by hammering or pressing heated ingots, blooms, billets, slabs, or bars on regulation press-and-hammer forging equipment with dies that are flat or slightly shaped. Closed-die or drop forgings are small- or medium-size shapes forged by using dies accurately formed to the size and shape of the desired finished product. Open-die forgings require machining to acquire the desired dimensions of the finished product. Closed-die forgings require little or no subsequent machining and are generally considered parts for import classification purposes. The forgings at issue have not been categorized as either open-die or closed-die forgings.         The Language of the Petition         The original petition describes the subject merchandise as follows:           The merchandise covered by this petition is all tapered roller bearings, tapered rollers and other parts thereof (both finished and unfinished) including, but not limited to, single-row, multiple-row (e.g., two-, four-), and thrust bearings and self-contained bearing packages (generally pre-set, pre-sealed, and pre-greased), but only to the extent that such merchandise is not presently covered by an outstanding antidumping duty order or finding in the United States.            In the petition, Timken stressed that it had identified TSUS numbers to the best of its ability, but that it did not intend that products under other classification numbers be excluded from the scope if they fell within the description of the product in the petition. Timken argues that the language of the petition unambiguously includes Koyo's forgings, since the petition requested coverage for all unfinished TRB parts not included in the A&hyph;588&hyph;054 finding which covers TRBs four inches or less in outside diameter. Timken takes the position that the instant forgings fall under the category of unfinished parts and they should properly have been classified that way. The fact that they were not named specifically in the petition does not imply that Timken did not intend to include them. Timken states that it was impossible for it to name each item that might be considered a TRB part.     Koyo, however, claims that since the petition never mentioned forgings, they were not included. In its ruling request Koyo argues that forgings are outside the scope of the order because they are ``precursor materials'' that have not yet begun the manufacturing process. Koyo claims that including forgings would be tantamount to including bearing grade steel in the scope of the order.     The Department's position is that the petition clearly includes unfinished TRB parts in its scope. However, the language in the petition is ambiguous with respect to whether forgings are considered unfinished parts.         The Language of the Commerce Department's Determinations         The products covered by the preliminary and final determinations and the order as it was published in 1987 are ``tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, currently classified under Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) item numbers 680.30 and 680.39; flange, take-up cartridge, and hanger units incorporating tapered roller bearings, currently classified under TSUS item number 661.10; and tapered roller housings (except pillow blocks) incorporating tapered rollers, with or without spindles, whether or not for automotive use, and currently classified under TSUS item number 692.32 or elsewhere in the TSUS. Products subject to the outstanding antidumping duty order covering certain tapered roller bearings from Japan (T.D. 76&hyph;227, 41 FR 34974) were not included within the scope of this investigation'' (see Antidumping Duty Order: Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan, 52 FR 37352, October 6, 1987). At issue is whether forgings should be considered unfinished parts within the scope of the order.     Timken claims that at the time of the order Koyo's imported forgings should have properly been classified as TRB parts, and that they are clearly included within the scope of the order. Koyo argues that the language of the order unambiguously excludes forgings, since at the time of the investigation Koyo was importing forgings under TSUS 606.7340 as ``non-machined steel forgings'', a provision not mentioned in the order. Koyo clearly stated in each of the first three administrative reviews that it considered its imported forgings to be outside the scope of the order, and neither the Department nor the petitioner objected. Therefore, Koyo argues that forgings have been considered outside the scope since the order was published.

text: nullnull      The Department's position is that, absent the rare case in which there is no narrative description of the subject merchandise, any TSUS or HTS numbers mentioned in the scope of an order are for reference only, and do not limit the scope in any way. The Department's position in this respect is supported by the fact that the scope description for each of the administrative reviews has contained a statement to the effect that the Customs classification numbers are provided for reference purposes only. However, the language used in the order to describe the products is ambiguous with respect to forgings, since forgings are not mentioned and there is no explicit indication of what products are included as unfinished parts. Moreover, while Koyo stated in its review responses that it did not report forgings, it is not apparent from these statements the form the imports took. As was described earlier, the term ``forgings'' covers a wide range of products. The question this scope inquiry poses for the Department is whether the instant forgings are advanced to the point that the Department considers them TRB parts.       The ITC's Determination       The International Trade Commission's (ITC) questionnaires in the investigation defined unfinished parts as ``*&blank;*&blank;* those that have been shaped sufficiently that they may be used only in the manufacture of tapered roller bearings.'' (p. 5). Likewise, the ITC considered whether to treat unfinished parts as separate like products in its final determination. It rejected Koyo's request to consider each of the following groups as discrete like products:          1. ``Precursor materials'' (i.e., unfinished forged rings) and ``finished bulk parts'' (i.e., rollers and cages) of tapered roller bearings;   2. Unfinished tapered roller bearing components (i.e._unfinished outer rings and inner rings);   3. Finished tapered roller bearings.          (Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, and Certain Housings Incorporating Tapered Rollers, from Japan, Inv. No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;343 (Final), USITC Pub 2020, September 1987, p. 5). The ITC reasoned that all parts are destined to become complete, finished TRBs and that neither finished nor unfinished parts have commercial value except as components of TRBs. To the extent that the ITC considered the items in this list a single like product, this statement suggests that the ITC considered forged rings to be unfinished parts.         The ITC also states in its final determination that:          Unfinished bearing components are the cones, cups, and rollers that have been green machined and heat treated, but that require final finishing *&blank;*&blank;* Green machining is an industry term that relates to the machining operations performed on the raw materials prior to heat treatment for cups, cones, and rollers. (p. A&hyph;8)          However, Timken points out that the ITC was discussing cups and cones made from tubing rather than forgings, and argues that the ITC's view that green machining is the first stage in the production process applies only to tubing. Timken claims that, in the bar-based manufacturing process Koyo uses, the first step in production is forging.       This is consistent with an ITC footnote (p. A&hyph;8) that the forging process is used instead of green machining, indicating that at least some of the green machining necessary on rings cut from tube steel is not necessary on forgings. Although the ITC considered green machining to be the turning point in Timken's tube-based production process, the distinction is blurred when forgings are used. Since forging can accomplish some of the same results as green machining, the ITC's description of the production process does not necessarily imply that forged rings are outside the scope of the order.         Diversified Products Analysis       While stages of production can be helpful in determining when raw material becomes an unfinished part, the descriptions of the merchandise in the petition and the Department's determinations are ambiguous with respect to the question of whether these forgings are unfinished parts. The ITC's final determination, though not perfectly clear, points toward the conclusion that forgings are within the scope of the order. However, because there is some ambiguity, the Department considered it appropriate to analyze the Diversified Products criteria. The four additional criteria the Department considered in determining if forgings are within the order are listed at 19 CFR 353.29(i)(2): (1) the physical characteristics of the product; (2) the expectations of the ultimate purchasers; (3) the ultimate use of the product; and (4) the channels of trade.

text: nullnull      Physical Characteristics       Timken points out that forgings are similar in size and shape to finished cups and cones. However, Koyo argues that there are dramatic differences between forgings and finished cups and cones. Some forgings are split in two to form both the cup and the cone. In the manufacturing steps that take place during the turning process, between 24% and 30% of the steel is removed from a forging, resulting in a green machined ring with the specific dimensions and tolerance of the finished cup or cone, or inner and outer raceways.   Koyo argues further that the forged rings are most similar to steel tube rings, which undergo the same processes (green machining, heat treatment, polishing, and grinding) before becoming a finished TRB part. Koyo states that ``both rings cut from tube and forged rings are intermediate donut-shaped pieces of steel that are first produced from steel bar and later further processed into parts for bearings'' (Koyo's letter to the Department, November 22, 1993, p.4). Both parties agree that rings cut from tube are outside the scope of the order, as indicated by Koyo's statement to that effect on page 24 of its letter and Timken's reference to rings cut from tube as raw material (p.23).   However, Timken points out that the forgings in question are a much more processed product than rings cut from tube steel. Forged rings have the approximate shapes of the cups and cones that they will be turned into. Indeed, forging gives them much of the definition that green machining would otherwise give. As a result, the forgings are effectively dedicated to use as TRB parts. Conversely, rings cut from tube steel bear little resemblance to cups or cones. Tube rings lose 50% to 75% of the weight of the ring during green machining, and can only be considered TRB parts after this process takes place. Given the advanced shape that forging gives the components, and the consequent reduction in green machining, the green machining process does not appear determinative in this case. Rather, it is the advanced physical characteristics of the component forgings that are definitive.     The Department preliminarily determines that forged rings are more processed than rings from tube stock, and, as such, are physically distinct from rings cut from tube steel. While some final machining is necessary, the forging process used in this case effectively transforms the metal input into a product sufficiently advanced in state that it is essentially a TRB component. Consequently, an examination of physical characteristics indicates that forgings are included in the scope of the order.       Channels of Trade       The forgings at issue are either produced by Koyo or purchased from steel forgers and sold by Koyo to AKBMC, its related subsidiary. Forgings move through the same channel of trade as unfinished parts, namely, to bearings producers for incorporation into tapered roller or antifriction bearings. Therefore, the Department preliminarily determines that the channels of trade criterion indicates that forgings are within the scope of the order.       Expectations of the Ultimate Purchaser       The forgings in question are imported into the United States for use in the production of TRBs. Timken points out that these forgings have undergone initial processing which renders them dedicated to use in a limited range of part numbers. Timken notes that the bearings producers who purchase these forgings have no expected use other than the production of finished bearings. Koyo submits, however, that finding forgings to be within the scope of the order based on the expectation criterion is comparable to concluding that bearing grade steel is also within the scope, since it too is imported for use in production of TRBs and has almost no alternative uses. Koyo argues further that rings cut from tube steel, which are outside the scope, are also limited to use in a specific range of models.

text: nullnull      The Department notes that although the expectations of the purchasers of bearing grade steel and of rings cut from tube steel are the same as those of purchasers of in-scope TRB parts, no one argues that bearing grade steel or rings cut from tube are steel are covered by the order. Moreover, bearing steel might be destined for bearing-related production but it has not been advanced to the point of dedicating it to a TRB component, finished or unfinished. By the same token, it is also possible that some rings cut from tube steel may not necessarily be intended for use in TRBs. However, the forgings in question have been advanced to the point that some use other than a TRB component is highly unlikely. Because the expectation of the parties importing the instant forgings is to make TRBs, the Department's position is that this criterion indicates that forgings are within the scope of the order.         Ultimate Use         Timken points out that forgings are more dedicated to use in TRBs than rings cut from tube steel, since these forgings more closely approximate the dimensions of the finished cup or cone and do not require as extensive a turning process as steel tube rings. Koyo contends that a ring cut from steel tube is as dedicated to use in TRBs as a forging is, because both are made from bearing grade steel, which Koyo claims is too expensive to be used for other purposes. Furthermore, Koyo argues, a steel tube ring and these forgings are equally limited in the range of bearings for which they can be used. However, Koyo uses the overwhelming portion of its imported forgings in the production of TRBs. Koyo suggests that it is possible to use some of the forgings to make both TRB and ball bearing parts (Koyo submitted an example of a ball bearing and a TRB that have inner rings made from the same forged ring), and it is theoretically possible for the manufacturer to use a forging originally intended for use in a TRB to produce a ball bearing instead, if production needs change after importation. In practice, this possibility is seldom realized because it is not cost efficient to create a forging with multiple uses. Forgings are used to limit the amount of machining that is necessary. The very concept of forging embodies shaping a blank to the degree that it appears dedicated to one product.

text: nullnull      The Department preliminarily determines that since the instant forgings appear dedicated to the production of TRBs, these forgings are essentially parts of TRBs. Therefore, the ultimate use criterion indicates that these forgings are within the scope of the order.         Conclusion         Based on our analysis of the comments provided by interested parties on the language of the petition and the determinations of the ITC and the Department, and on the physical characteristics, channels of trade, expectations of the ultimate purchasers, and the ultimate use of the product, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i), we preliminarily determine that such forgings are the same class or kind of merchandise as unfinished TRB parts, and therefore are within the scope of the order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from Japan. The Department preliminarily determines these forgings to be within the scope based on the totality of the facts presented above and especially for the following reasons: (1) the ITC clearly includes precursor materials such as forgings within its definition of like product; (2) the physical characteristics, channels of trade, ultimate use of forgings, and expectations of ultimate purchasers indicate that such forgings are within the scope of the order.     We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination no later than March 18, 1994. Rebuttal comments are due no later than March 25, 1994. The Department will consider such comments in reaching its final determination.     This preliminary scope ruling is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(d)(3).

Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Washington State Office (P561) and the NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center (P770    #    66) have applied in due form for permits, and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has applied in due form for two modifications to Permit 818 (211C), to take listed species of Snake River salmon, as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217&hyph;227).     The USDA, Washington State Office requests authorization to take listed juvenile Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon (    Oncorhynchus tshawytscha    ) in research activities to determine the presence or absence of those species in various backwater side channels and farm ponds associated with the Tucannon River and Asotin Creek. The purpose of the research is to prepare for habitat restoration in those streams, in coordination with local landowners, state agencies, the Bonneville Power Administration, and affected tribes. The applicant requests this authorization for a duration of two years.     The NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center requests authorization to conduct eight scientific research studies involving the take of listed juvenile Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon and juvenile Snake River sockeye salmon (    O. nerka    ). The applicant requests this authorization for a duration of one to five years for the different studies.     ODFW requests two modifications to their scientific research Permit 818. The first request is for authorization to install trap boxes on eight diversion screens to enable the collection of information on species composition and migration timing of listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon. In addition, these traps would allow the movement of trapped fish to available water when the water supply in the irrigation stream channels is insufficient. The second request is for authorization to take scale samples from adult and juvenile Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon. The applicant requests authorization for both modifications for the duration of the permit, through December 31, 1996.     Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on an application should be submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Hwy., Silver Spring, MD 20910, within 30 days of the publication of this notice.

headline: Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award Cooperative Agreement to Urban Energy and Transportation Corporation
text:   SUMMARY:     The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) to Urban Energy and Transportation Corporation (UETC) under Cooperative Agreement Number DE&hyph;FC01&hyph;94EW54065. Estimated total funding in the amount of $15,000,000 will be provided to obtain local officials' participation and expertise in transportation activities including collection and dissemination of information, conducting regional and national workshops, providing technical assistance, and identification and analyses of issues related to transportation of hazardous materials through large urban areas. This activity will promote better understanding of local views concerning clean-up technologies, emergency management and training issues, and transportation operations and outreach. As a result, this will enable DOE to develop programs that will better meet those local needs.        The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) that UETC will provide continued activity which is necessary to the satisfactory completion of an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.    The proposed effort is to establish and maintain networks of senior decision-makers from local communities who are responsible for or concerned about technology development, transportation, and emergency issues associated with energy-related facilities.    UETC has a vast array of techniques to accomplish the objectives of the proposed project, including professional techniques in structured meeting design and facilitation, information dissemination through printed products such as newsletters and electronic media, opinion surveys, planning and program evaluation, and public and institutional involvement.    The anticipated period of performance is 60 months from the effective date of award.         null                               <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     U.S. Department of Energy.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of non-competitive financial assistance award.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) to Urban Energy and Transportation Corporation (UETC) under Cooperative Agreement Number DE&hyph;FC01&hyph;94EW54065.

headline: Availability of a Study on the Safety of Shipments of Plutonium by Sea 
text:   SUMMARY:     The Department of Energy, in conjunction with other Federal agencies, has completed a study and submitted it to Congress on   February 8, 1994, on the Safety of Shipments of Plutonium by Sea. The study was conducted under the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and section 2904 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;486. By memorandum dated January 7, 1993, the President authorized the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard to proceed with the study.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The subject study represents a review and evaluation of readily available pertinent technical reports which were discussed among the participating agencies during the course of the preparation of the study from October to December 1992. After reviewing the hazards posed by plutonium, applicable transportation safety and physical protection regulations, pertinent research and experience, and contingency plans, the agencies participating in this study conclude that plutonium can be shipped safely by sea.         Public Law 102&hyph;486 also requires the preparation and submittal to Congress of an Implementation Plan that describes the plan for implementing the recommendations contained in the study. The Implementation Plan must be submitted to Congress and made available for public viewing 90 days after issuance of the study. Subsequent to enactment of the legislation calling for this study and Implementation Plan, and subsequent to preparation of the study, several individual members of Congress have raised additional concerns relating to the shipment of radioactive materials by sea. These concerns include the safety of shipment of other material proposed to be shipped (e.g., glassified high-level nuclear waste and mixed oxide fuel), as well as the need to evaluate risk assessment elements. These elements are shipping routes, adequacy of the revised International Maritime Organization code for radioactive shipments, the consequences and probability of the ``maximum credible accident'' in shipping by sea, and the examination of threats of sabotage and terrorism. The participating Federal agencies will address these additional concerns in the Implementation Plan to the extent that they relate to the recommendations in the study. Where certain issues raised do not fall within the framework of the study and Implementation Plan, the agencies will ensure that they are addressed through direct communication with the members of Congress who raised them.

Northern estimates the cost of these facilities to be $6,065,000 which would be financed with internally generated funds.     Northern proposes to construct the facilities to provide additional capacity on Northern's mainline north between its Owatonna Compressor Station (Owatonna) in Steele County, Minnesota and its North Branch Compressor Station in Chicago County, Minnesota to serve additional market requirements of 19,788 Mcf of natural gas per day requested by Minnegasco and Great Plains during a thirty day open season from November 10, 1993 to December 9, 1993. Northern states that the Alexandria Branchline loop is required to meet Minnegasco's increased requirements served from the branchline. Northern states that the mainline facilities would increase the capacity of the mainline north of Owatonna by 19,288 Mcf of natural gas per day and is required for the 1994&hyph;95 heating season. The balance would be transported through existing capacity, it is indicated.

Take notice that on February 14, 1994, Chandeleur Pipe Line Company (Chandeleur), P.O. Box 740339, New Orleans, LA 70174, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;233&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the increase of maximum operating pressures and total system maximum capacity of its pipeline, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.    Chandeleur states that it consists of a 79.9 mile 12-inch mainline, a parallel 82.3 mile 16-inch mainline (which loops the 12-inch line) and an 11.3 mile 12-inch lateral gas supply pipeline. The maximum operating pressure of the 12-inch mainline is 1100 psig. The maximum operating pressure of the 16-inch mainline 1000 psig. The maximum operating pressure of the 12-inch lateral is 1318 psig. The current authorized system capacity is 205,000 Mcf per day, with maximum capacity of 240,000 Mcf per day.    Specifically, Chandeleur requests authorization to increase the maximum operating pressures of both its 12-inch and 16-inch mainlines to 1200 psig. Chandeleur states that it has recently completed a new interconnection with Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation's (``TETCO'') 24-inch mainline in offshore Louisiana in OCS Breton Sound Block 42 for the purpose of allowing Chandeleur's shippers to transport gas into TETCO's system, thereby increasing the shippers' delivery options. Chandeleur states that TETCO's maximum operating pressure is 1200 psig. To allow delivery of natural gas from Chandeleur into TETCO's 24-inch mainline when TETCO is operating at maximum pressure, Chandeleur states that its maximum operating pressure must match TETCO's and therefore must be increased to 1200 psig.    Chandeleur states that the requested increase in pressure to 1200 psig is within maximum allowable operating pressures for Chandeleur's pipeline as established by the Department of Transportation.    Chandeleur states that the requested increase in operating pressure and maximum capacity will allow its current and future shippers to increase the amount of gas they can transport to existing markets and to new markets which are not now economically accessible through Chandeleur.    Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before March 3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 18 CFR 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).

headline: Integrated Resource Planning Impact on Utility Systems and Consumers 
text:   SUMMARY:     The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Program is interested in soliciting the opinions of electric and gas utilities and their trade associations, electricity and gas consumer associations, State regulatory commissions and energy offices, consumer and other public interest groups, and universities, research and consulting firms concerning the likely effects of IRP on utility systems, consumers and small businesses. Responses to this request will assist the DOE in satisfying both its near-term and longer-term IRP evaluation responsibilities.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     I. EPAct's IRP Reporting Requirements of DOE         The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) contains several requirements of DOE to report to the President and Congress on the status and likely impacts of electric and gas IRP development across the nation. These IRP-related reporting requirements can be found in EPAct, Title I_Energy Efficiency, Subtitle B_Utilities, Sections 111(e) and 115(e). The purpose of this notice is to obtain information relevant to the IRP evaluation and small business impact reporting requirements by soliciting the opinions of IRP stakeholders concerning the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, dependence on particular energy sources, and small businesses engaged in providing energy services. In the near-term, DOE must satisfy these EPAct requirements which call for DOE to prepare this report to the President and Congress within two years of EPAct's enactment. The report must contain, among other IRP-related items, an evaluation which determines:            &bull;Whether and to what extent IRP (electric only) is likely to result in_    a. Higher or lower electricity costs to an electric utility's ultimate consumers or to classes or groups of such consumers;     b. Enhanced or reduced reliability of electric service; and     c. Increased or decreased dependence on particular energy resources; as well as     &bull;The competitive impact of implementation of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other DSM programs by utilities (electric and gas) on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing of similar energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other DSM measures; and whether any unfair, deceptive, or predatory acts exist, or are likely to exist, from implementation of such programs.            The DOE IRP Program will also use responses to this request for providing insight into the direction of the Program's longer-term research agenda related to assessing the national impacts of IRP. Responses to this request will be analyzed and reported by the staff of DOE's Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Program, which is under the auspices of the Office of Utility Technologies which is under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. This summary will characterize what various groups believe to be the likely impacts of electric IRP on the nation.         II. Purpose of Request         The overall legislative intent of Subsection 111 of EPAct is to promote energy efficiency, in particular by encouraging utilities and States to adopt the planning principles of IRP. The legislative intent of the requirements to report the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, and dependence on particular energy resources is to assess the likely results of IRP implementation against the intended purpose and goals of EPAct's IRP-related provisions. It is also the intent of the provision to determine the competitive impacts of the energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other demand-side management programs of electric and gas utilities on small businesses to ensure that State regulatory commissions are considering the impact which expanded DSM programs may have on small businesses already engaged in similar activities, and are implementing measures to assure that utility actions will not provide utilities with an unfair competitive advantage over such small businesses.     The DOE's IRP Program is responsible for this report. The program views the Federal role in IRP development as a collector of important data, a conduit of the lessons learned by experienced IRP practitioners to new IRP adopters, a developer of new tools and data bases and monitorer of the outcomes of IRP processes around the country. Among the priorities in this effort is the fulfillment of these EPAct reporting requirements concerning the likely impacts of IRP on the nation.     Submitting this report to the President and Congress will be a component of a continuing effort by DOE's IRP Program to monitor and evaluate the impact of IRP on the nation's States, utilities and consumers. The IRP Program views as part of its role to think critically about IRP and its expected benefits. Because DOE implements national energy policies that emphasize IRP as a potential solution to some of the problems affecting the nation's utility energy services, an assessment as to whether and to what extent IRP is providing overall benefit to the nation, as it is practiced, is a necessary and important DOE responsibility.                    <USBUREAU>Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</USBUREAU>     <DOCTITLE>Integrated Resource Planning Impact on Utility Systems and Consumers </DOCTITLE>       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, DOE.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of inquiry and request for comments.           </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Program is interested in soliciting the opinions of electric and gas utilities and their trade associations, electricity and gas consumer associations, State regulatory commissions and energy offices, consumer and other public interest groups, and universities, research and consulting firms concerning the likely effects of IRP on utility systems, consumers and small businesses.

Increased or decreased dependence on particular energy resources; as well as     &bull;The competitive impact of implementation of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other DSM programs by utilities (electric and gas) on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing of similar energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other DSM measures; and whether any unfair, deceptive, or predatory acts exist, or are likely to exist, from implementation of such programs.            The DOE IRP Program will also use responses to this request for providing insight into the direction of the Program's longer-term research agenda related to assessing the national impacts of IRP. Responses to this request will be analyzed and reported by the staff of DOE's Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Program, which is under the auspices of the Office of Utility Technologies which is under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. This summary will characterize what various groups believe to be the likely impacts of electric IRP on the nation.         II. Purpose of Request         The overall legislative intent of Subsection 111 of EPAct is to promote energy efficiency, in particular by encouraging utilities and States to adopt the planning principles of IRP. The legislative intent of the requirements to report the impact of IRP on electricity costs to consumers, reliability of electric service, and dependence on particular energy resources is to assess the likely results of IRP implementation against the intended purpose and goals of EPAct's IRP-related provisions. It is also the intent of the provision to determine the competitive impacts of the energy conservation, energy efficiency, and other demand-side management programs of electric and gas utilities on small businesses to ensure that State regulatory commissions are considering the impact which expanded DSM programs may have on small businesses already engaged in similar activities, and are implementing measures to assure that utility actions will not provide utilities with an unfair competitive advantage over such small businesses.     The DOE's IRP Program is responsible for this report. The program views the Federal role in IRP development as a collector of important data, a conduit of the lessons learned by experienced IRP practitioners to new IRP adopters, a developer of new tools and data bases and monitorer of the outcomes of IRP processes around the country. Among the priorities in this effort is the fulfillment of these EPAct reporting requirements concerning the likely impacts of IRP on the nation.     Submitting this report to the President and Congress will be a component of a continuing effort by DOE's IRP Program to monitor and evaluate the impact of IRP on the nation's States, utilities and consumers. The IRP Program views as part of its role to think critically about IRP and its expected benefits. Because DOE implements national energy policies that emphasize IRP as a potential solution to some of the problems affecting the nation's utility energy services, an assessment as to whether and to what extent IRP is providing overall benefit to the nation, as it is practiced, is a necessary and important DOE responsibility.         </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      III. Definitions of IRP         To ensure that all respondents to this notice have a common understanding of DOE's perspective on the role of IRP in utility planning, DOE offers the following to define IRP's scope and parameters and to describe the characteristics which distinguish IRP from traditional planning approaches.     Traditional planning techniques used by utilities once focus only on investing in supply-side resources to satisfy customers' needs. A distinguishing factor of the IRP process is that it includes both supply- and demand-side resources in meeting demands for utility energy services. According to Section 111 of EPAct, IRP for electric utility service is:            A planning and selection process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including new generating capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating and cooling applications, and renewable energy resources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its customers at the lowest system cost.            In addition to promoting a mix of alternative resources, IRP infuses the interests of all stakeholders: Utilities, ratepayers, regulators, stockholders, and interest groups. The following explanation of IRP, also taken from EPAct Section 111, reflects the idea that IRP is a process that evaluates the issues raised by different stakeholders.            The Process [will] take into account necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability, and other factors of risk; [will] take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved through energy conservation and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; [and will] treat demand and supply resources on a consistent and integrated basis.            The DOE approach to IRP for utility and State energy planning is to treat all options_supply, storage, delivery, and demand-side_on a consistent basis using a systems approach without preconceptions or bias for or against any particular option, fuel type, or form of ownership. The following characteristics distinguish IRP from traditional planning techniques.            1. IRP examines the full range of energy and capacity resources including demand-side management programs, transmission and distribution systems, and non-traditional supply alternatives.     2. IRP gives consideration to the full range of economic, environmental, social, and technological factors.     3. IRP facilitates public involvement in utility planning.     4. IRP facilitates consideration of the risks and uncertainties posed by different resource portfolios and by external factors such as fluctuations in energy prices and economic conditions.         IV. Nature of Information Sought         DOE urges those interested in responding to this notice to consider the provided definition of IRP and its characteristics and to consider the following list of questions. DOE is also interested in gauging the evolution of IRP practices around the nation, particularly as those practices apply to the significant changes that are likely to occur in the utility services industry over the next several years. Therefore, DOE urges respondents to also consider each of the following questions and explain how they might answer those questions five years from now. Respondents are asked to please include their underlying assumptions which accompany their opinions on the future status and likely impact of IRP. This information will enhance DOE's ability to accurately interpret the response and compare it to the opinions of other respondents.      Has the implementation of IRP changed (or is likely to change) the per unit cost as well as the total bill for electricity for consumers from pre-IRP levels? How, if at all, have different consumer classes or groups experienced (or are likely to experience) changes in the cost of their electric service as a result of IRP? Are these changes good or bad and why? What characteristics of IRP are most responsible for the changes in electricity costs which you have cited for the previous questions? What studies, reports, or other information underlie your comments?      Has the implementation of IRP enhanced or reduced (or is likely to enhance or reduce) the overall reliability of electric service to customers? What, if any, are the IRP characteristics most responsible (or likely to be most responsible) for a change in the level of electric service reliability since IRP has been implemented? What studies, reports, or other information underlie your comments?

This publication, updated quarterly, provides information to the public about training providers and courses approved for accreditation purposes pursuant to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA). As a nationwide listing of approved asbestos training programs and courses, the NDAAC has replaced the similar listing which was formerly published quarterly by EPA in the     Federal Register    . The February 28, 1994, directory, which supersedes the version released on November 30, 1993, may be ordered through the NDAAC Clearinghouse along with a variety of related reports.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Pursuant to AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA), contractors who prepare management plans for schools, inspect for asbestos in schools or public and commercial buildings, or design or conduct response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing materials in schools or public and commercial buildings, are required to obtain accreditation by completing prescribed training requirements. EPA therefore maintains a current national listing of AHERA-accredited courses and approved training providers so that this information will be readily available to assist the public in accessing these training programs and obtaining the necessary accreditation. The information is also maintained so that the Agency and approved state accreditation and licensing programs will have a reliable means of identifying and verifying the approval status of training courses and organizations.      Previously, EPA had published this listing in the     Federal Register     on a quarterly basis. The last     Federal Register     listing required by law was published on August 30, 1991. EPA recognized the need to continue publication of this document even though the legislative mandate had expired.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), requires that ATSDR and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually revise the Priority List of Hazardous Substances to include additional substances most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). This announcement provides notice that the agencies have developed and are making available a revised CERCLA Priority List of 275 Hazardous Substances, based on the most recent information available to ATSDR and EPA. This revised priority list includes newly listed substances which have been determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health at or around NPL hazardous waste sites. Each substance on the priority list is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared by ATSDR and subsequent identification of priority data needs.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     CERCLA establishes certain requirements for ATSDR and EPA with regard to hazardous substances which are most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA NPL. Section 104(i)(2) of CERCLA, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(2)), requires that the two agencies prepare a list, in order of priority, of at least 100 hazardous substances that are most commonly found at facilities on the NPL and which, in their sole discretion, are determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health (see 52 FR 12866, April 17, 1987). CERCLA also requires the agencies to revise the priority list to include 100 or more additional hazardous substances (see 53 FR 41280, October 20, 1988), and to include at least 25 additional hazardous substances in each of the three successive years following the 1988 revision (see 54 FR 43619, October 26, 1989; 55 FR 42067, October 17, 1990; 56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991). CERCLA also requires that ATSDR and EPA shall, not less often than once every year thereafter, revise the list to include additional hazardous substances which are determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health. Each substance on the CERCLA priority list of hazardous substances is a candidate to become the subject of a toxicological profile prepared by ATSDR and the subsequent identification of priority data needs.                        <USBUREAU>Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry</USBUREAU>     <RINDOCK>[ATSDR&hyph;78] </RINDOCK>        Revised Priority List of Hazardous Substances   That Will Be the Subject of Toxicological Profiles        <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Public Health Service (PHS), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).       </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice.         </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), requires that ATSDR and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually revise the Priority List of Hazardous Substances to include additional substances most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL).

text: nullnull      The previous priority lists of hazardous substances were based on the most comprehensive and relevant information available when the lists were developed. More comprehensive sources of information on the frequency of occurrence and the potential for human exposure of substances at NPL sites became available for use in the 1991 priority list with the development of ATSDR's HazDat database; additional information from HazDat has become available for this year's listing activity. In the initial listing activities (1987&hyph;1990), new substances were added to the end of the list, without a comparative reranking. A notice announcing the intention of ATSDR and EPA to revise and rerank the priority list of hazardous substances was published on June 27, 1991 (56 FR 29485). In this year's listing activity, as in the previous two years, new candidate substances (substances found at three or more NPL sites) were assigned a toxicity/environmental score (TES) using the EPA Reportable Quantity methodology, and were added to the pool of substances previously considered for the annual list. All substances were then evaluated together for consideration on the priority list.   The approach used to generate the 1991 revised priority list was summarized in the ``Revised Priority List of Hazardous Substances'' (56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991). Using the same approach, and the same algorithm this year, over 700 candidate substances have been ranked to create the current list of 275 substances.   The additional information used in this year's listing activity was entered into ATSDR's HazDat database since the development of the 1992 Priority List of Hazardous Substances. As with other site-specific information used in the listing activity, this information has been collected from ATSDR Public Health Assessments and from site file data packages used in the development of Public Health Assessments. The new information includes more recent NPL frequency of occurrence data, additional concentration data, and more information on exposure or potential exposure to substances present at NPL sites.   At this time the list includes 275 substances which ATSDR and EPA have determined to pose the most significant potential threat to human health based on the criteria of CERCLA section 104(i)(2) (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(2)). All candidate substances have been analyzed and ranked with the current algorithm, and may become the subject of toxicological profiles in the future.   The addition of approximately 12,800 contaminant data records (for air, water and soil) to the HazDat database since October 1992 has allowed the agencies to better assess the potential for human exposure to substances at NPL hazardous waste sites. With this additional data, 10 new candidate substances have been added to the list, and 13 substances under consideration last year have moved onto the list. Accordingly, 23 substances have been replaced on the list of the 275 substances. These changes in the order of substances appearing on the CERCLA priority list of hazardous substances will be reflected in the program activities which rely on the list for future direction. For example, Dicofol moved up significantly (to number 107) on the 1993 list when compared to last year's list. As a result it will be included in the pool of substances that may become the subject of new toxicological profiles in the next fiscal year. Similarly, alpha-Endosulfan (number 33) moved well into the range of those substances to be considered for the development of updated toxicological profiles (CERCLA also requires ATSDR to evaluate new information on profiled substances for potential revision every three years). These changes reflect the dynamic nature of scientific data on substances present at NPL (and other) hazardous waste sites.   This annual evaluation activity and announcement of a revised priority list of hazardous substances fulfills the conditions of CERCLA section 104(i), as amended, which requires ATSDR and EPA to revise the list yearly to include additional hazardous substances. The agencies intend to revise the list of hazardous substances annually thereafter to reflect changes and improvements in data collection and availability. Additional information on the methodology used in the development of the CERCLA Priority List of Hazardous Substances can be found in the     Federal Register     notices mentioned above.       Administrative Record       ATSDR and EPA are establishing a single administrative record entitled ATSDR&hyph;78 for materials pertaining to this notice. All materials received as a result of this notice will be included in the public file which is available for inspection from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal legal holidays, at the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,     #    4 Executive Park Drive, Suite 2400, Atlanta, Georgia.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board is proposing to revise regulations on spousal rights in accordance with changes made to the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA) by Public Law 103&hyph;226 to delete all references to former spouses and to accord all spouses of TSP participants covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) the right to a survivor annuity, unless they waive that option.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Public Law 103&hyph;226, 108 Stat. 111 (March 30, 1994), amends FERSA, 5 U.S.C. chapter 84 and section 8351, to give all TSP participants, regardless of their eligibility for basic retirement benefits, the same withdrawal options upon separation that have previously been available only to participants who separate with eligibility for basic retirement benefits. As a result, spouses of all TSP participants, regardless of the participant's eligibility for basic retirement benefits, have been provided with the same rights as those previously available to spouses of participants who were eligible for basic retirement benefits. This means that spouses of FERS participants who were previously only entitled to notice (if the participant separated without eligibility for basic retirement benefits) now have the right to a survivor annuity, unless the spouse waives that right. The required annuity is a joint life annuity with the spouse with 50 percent survivor benefits, level payments, and a no cash refund feature. As a result of this statutory change, 5 CFR 1650.17 has been revised to delete the requirement to notify the spouse with the TSP participant who is covered by FERS lacks eligibility for basic retirement benefits.        Spouses of Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) participants are entitled to notice whether or not the participant separated from Federal service with eligibility for basic retirement benefits. This notice requirement was not affected by Public Law 103&hyph;226.    Public Law 103&hyph;226 also eliminates the requirement to notify former spouses of FERS and CSRS participants who separate from Federal service without eligibility for basic retirement benefits that the participant is withdrawing his or her TSP account. Accordingly, all references to former spouse have been eliminated from 5 CFR part 1650, subpart G. (Because there are no longer any references to ``former spouses,'' the word ``current'' has also been eliminated wherever it appeared to describe the spouse to whom a participant is married.) This means that participants are no longer required to provide the TSP Service Office with an address for a former spouse, or, if a former spouse cannot be located, to obtain an exception to the requirement to notify a former spouse.    In addition to the changes made by Public Law 103&hyph;226, other changes explain or clarify spousal rights and exceptions to those rights. Section 1650.19 is revised to delete language stating that the employee and spouse may jointly waive the survivor annuity. The participant waives the survivor annuity by electing a different withdrawal option, while it is the spouse who must explicitly sign a waiver statement.    Section 1650.21 provides that the Executive Director may grant an exception to the requirement to obtain the spouse's signature or the spouse notice requirement where the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. The requirement to obtain the spouse's signature on the appropriate form to waive the joint and survivor annuity is referred to as the signature requirement. The notice requirement refers to the entitlement of the spouse of a CSRS participant to notice of the participant's withdrawal election. This section is being revised to allow participants who are seeking an exception to the signature or the notice requirement based on whereabouts unknown to submit statements in lieu of affidavits or declarations in support of their requests. These statements must be made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides that whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.    To ensure that the persons making the statements are aware of the possible penalty, &sect;1650.21(c) requires inclusion of the following on each statement: I understand that a false statement or willful misrepresentation is punishable under Federal Law (18 U.S.C. 1001) by a fine or imprisonment or both.    To ease the burden on participants further, &sect;&sect;1650.21 and 1650.22 are being revised to delete the requirement that the participant obtain and provide only documents bearing an original signature or which are embossed or which bear the imprint of a seal. Participants may now submit photocopies of documents.    Sections 1650.21(d) and 1650.22(c) are added to explain that a withdrawal form received within one year of approval of the exception may be processed without a new exception. An exception is valid only for the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.

Sections 1650.21(d) and 1650.22(c) are added to explain that a withdrawal form received within one year of approval of the exception may be processed without a new exception. An exception is valid only for the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.  </SUPPLEM>

It is for this purpose that the loan provisions are cross-referenced.    Finally, &sect;1650.22 provides that the Executive Director may grant an exception to the requirement that the participant obtain his or her spouse's signature where there are exceptional circumstances that warrant such an exception.

(a) The right of the spouse to a survivor annuity may be waived in writing by the spouse on the appropriate TSP form.    (b) When required by the regulations in this subpart, the appropriate survivor annuity waiver shall be filed with the TSP Service Office prior to the date the participant's election of benefits is effective.    6. Section 1650.20 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:        &sect;1650.20     Notice to spouse.        (a) Wherever in the regulations in this subpart it is required that the Executive Director provide notice of an action affecting a participant's account to the spouse of a participant prior to taking the action, such requirements may be satisfied by the TSP Service Office's sending a notice describing the action by first class mail to the last address of the spouse on file with the Plan.        * * * * *        7.

Whenever in the regulations in this subpart it is required that the Executive Director give notice of an action to the spouse of a participant, an exception to this requirement may be granted in cases in which the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive Director that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined. A request for an exception based on whereabouts unknown must be submitted to the Executive Director on the appropriate TSP form accompanied by either_    (a) A judicial determination (court order) which states that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or    (b) A police or Governmental agency determination that is signed by the appropriate department or division head which states that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or    (c) Statements by the participant and two other persons. Each statement must be signed and dated and must state the following: I understand that a false statement or willful misrepresentation is punishable under Federal Law (18 U.S.C. 1001) by a fine or imprisonment or both.    (1) The participant's statement must give the full name of his or her spouse, declare the inability to locate the spouse, and state the efforts made to locate the spouse. Negative statements such as ``I have not seen or heard from him/her'' or ``I have had no contact with him/her'' are not sufficient. Examples of attempting to locate the spouse include checking with relatives and mutual friends or using telephone directories or directory assistance for the city of last known address.    (2) The statements from two other persons must support the participant's statement that the participant does not know the whereabouts of his or her spouse.    (d) A withdrawal election received within one year of an approved exception may be processed so long as the spouse named on the form is the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.    (e) The requirements for establishing an exception for a withdrawal and the one-year period of validity of an approved exception apply to exceptions for loans under 5 CFR 1655.18.  8. Section 1650.22 is revised to read as follows:      &sect;1650.22      Executive Director's exception to the requirement to obtain the spouse's signature.          Wherever in the regulations in this subpart the spouse's signature is required, the Executive Director may grant an exception to this requirement if the participant can show that:    (a) The spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined in accordance with the provisions of &sect;1650.21; or    (b) Due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the spouse's signature would otherwise be inappropriate.    (1) An exception to the spousal signature requirement may be granted based on exceptional circumstances only when the participant presents a judicial determination (court order) or a governmental agency determination signed by the appropriate department or division head. A court order or a determination must contain a finding or a recitation of such exceptional circumstances regarding the spouse as would warrant an exception to the signature requirement.    (2) Exceptional circumstances is narrowly construed and includes such circumstances as when a court order:    (i) Indicates that the spouse and the participant have been maintaining separate residences with no financial relationship for three or more years;    (ii) Indicates that the spouse abandoned the participant but, for religious or similarly compelling reasons, the parties chose not to divorce; or    (iii) Expressly states that the participant may obtain a loan from his or her Thrift Savings Plan account or withdraw his or her thrift Savings Plan account balance notwithstanding the absence of the spouse's signature.    (c) A withdrawal election received within one year of an approved exception may be processed so long as the spouse named on the form is the spouse for whom the exception has been approved.

Supplementary Information:   Executive Orders 12866 and 12778         This rule is exempt from Executive Order 12866 review.   This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.     The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 14 of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, any provisions of such order or any obligations imposed in connection with such order are not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint is filed within 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.         Effect on Small Entities       The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601     et seq.    ).     Currently, 618 egg producers pay assessments to the American Egg Board (AEB). A proposed rule to increase the exemption level from 30,000 to 75,000 laying hens was published in the     Federal Register     on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13460). The increased exemption level would exempt 253 small egg producers who represent 41 percent of the egg producers currently paying assessments, but only 4 percent of AEB's total assessment income. It is anticipated that the 75,000-hen exemption level would be in place before the referendum on the assessment rate increase. Therefore, a change in the assessment rate would affect only egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying hens.     There are an estimated 365 producers who own more than 75,000 hens. Currently, egg producers must pay a mandatory assessment of 5 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs marketed to fund the research and promotion activities authorized by the Act. The present 5-cent assessment is equivalent to approximately 0.231 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton of Large eggs. An assessment rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case would be equivalent to approximately 0.463 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton of Large eggs. This is based on the Economic Research Service's 3-year average wholesale price for New York City Grade A Large cartoned eggs (1991&hyph;93) of 72 cents per dozen. AEB collects approximately $7.5 million annually from the 5-cent assessment, and it is estimated that it would collect $14 million for a 10-cent assessment. It is estimated that any additional costs would be offset by the benefits to be derived from strengthened research and promotion programs.         Paperwork Reduction       Information collection requirements and recordkeeping provisions contained in 7 CFR Part 1250 have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB Control No. 0581&hyph;0093 under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.     No additional recordkeeping requirements would be imposed as a result of this proposed rule. It has been estimated that it will take an average of about 30 minutes for each of the approximately 380 egg producers to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting.

text: nullnull      Background and Proposed Changes         The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) was amended December 14, 1993 (Pub. Law 103&hyph;188. The amendments raised the maximum rate of assessment paid by egg producers to the American Egg Board (AEB) from 10 cents to 20 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. The actual rate is prescribed by the Egg Research and Promotion Order and is currently 5 cents per case. Any increase from the 5 cents must be approved by producers voting in a referendum.     A proposed rule to increase the assessment rate in the Order from 5 cents to 10 cents per case was published in the     Federal Register     on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31174). Comments were solicited from interested persons through August 16, 1994. Two comments were received; one from a major egg producer organization in support and one from an egg producer in opposition to the increase.     The commenter who opposed the increase cited the decline in number of egg producers from 10,000 to 400 since AEB has been in existence and that AEB programs have not halted the decline. However, the decrease in the number of producers paying assessments is the result of several factors. First, when AEB was first implemented in 1976, more than 6,000 producers owning over 3,000 laying hens were on record. By 1989, the number had decreased to approximately 2,000 due to consolidations and bankruptcies during a time when the economic situation was poor. In 1990, the exemption level was changed to 30,000 laying hens, decreasing the number of producers by 36 percent. The exemption level was changed again on August 1, 1994, to 75,000 hens, reducing the number to just under 400 producers.     The commenter also expressed disapproval that a large percentage of the proposed increase in funds might be used for advertising, resulting in a temporary boost in demand and that such demand would be quickly swallowed up by expanded production. The commenter also noted that AEB has a function in the industry but must remain lean to ensure funds are spent wisely. The commenter expressed concern that AEB not look for budget expenditures to justify the increased assessment. AEB's administrative costs have steadily remained at approximately 3 percent. Further, as required by the 1993 amendments to the Act, AEB submitted to the Department a marketing analysis showing the need for an assessment increase.     The commenter was also opposed to the referendum voting rules. The commenter indicated that the rules allow the number of hens owned to give more weight to the vote, thereby granting larger producers more voting power. The Act provides that a referendum vote will pass if approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers voting     or     by a majority of producers voting if they represent not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced.     The commenter further was of the view that the assessment rate should remain at its current level of 5 cents, that producers should be allowed to voluntarily give an extra 5 or 10 cents, and that refunds should be available. The Act was amended in 1993 to provide that AEB may recommend an increased assessment rate to the Secretary. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, AEB has done so, and the assessment increase as proposed herein will be subject to a referendum vote.     It is directed that, in accordance with the procedures for the conduct of referenda (7 CFR 1250.200 et seq.), a referendum will be held beginning September 26, 1994, and ending on October 14, 1994, to determine whether producers favor the increase to 10 cents per case as proposed.     Section 9 of the Act requires approval by eligible egg producers engaged in commercial egg production during the representative period and at the time of voting. The representative period for the conduct of the referendum is determined to be May 1, 1994, through July 31, 1994.     For the Order amendment to be approved, it must be favored by at least two-thirds of the producers voting in this referendum     or     by a majority of the producers voting if such majority represents not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced by those voting.     The agents of the Secretary to conduct the referendum are hereby designated to be Janice L. Lockard and Angela C. Clonts, both of the Poultry Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. The agents may appoint subagents to assist them in performing their duties.     Ballots, instructions, eligibility requirements, and other information pertinent to the referendum will be mailed to all known eligible egg producers. In accordance with Public Law 103&hyph;188 and recent amendments to the implementing Order (59 FR 38875), producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from paying assessments under the Act and are therefore not eligible to vote in the referendum.

text:   SUMMARY:     This proposed rule would amend the regulations to set forth the acreage reduction percentage, if any, and the national average price support rate for the 1995 crop of rice. This action is required by section 101B of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (1949 Act), as amended. This proposed rule outlines a range of acreage reduction percentage options proposed for the 1995 crop of rice and requests comments regarding price support rate adjustments for different types and grades of rice.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Executive Order 12866        This proposed rule has been determined to be economically significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866.       Regulatory Flexibility Act        It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject matter of this rule. A Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis was prepared that determined that this regulation will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the particular acreage reduction percentages considered will not affect the paperwork, reporting, or compliance burdens of the small entities in the program. CCC thus certifies that the rule will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposed rule and the impact of the implementation of each option is available on request from the above-named individual.         Environmental Evaluation        It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.       Federal Assistance Program        The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this proposed rule applies, are: Rice Production Stabilization_10.065.       Executive Order 12778        This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not require the exhaustion of any administrative appeal remedies.       Executive Order 12372        This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).       Paperwork Reduction Act        The amendments to 7 CFR part 1413 set forth in this proposed rule do not contain information collections that require clearance by OMB under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35.         Request for Public Comment        Comments are requested with respect to this proposed rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the final rule.       Background        In accordance with section 101B of the 1949 Act, an acreage reduction program (ARP) may be implemented for the 1995 rice crop if it is determined that the total supply of rice, in the absence of such a program, would be excessive taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices, and to meet a national emergency.    Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of rice to desirable goals. A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the considered program options, it is not needed to achieve the statutory stocks-to-use levels of rice.    If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (from 0 to 35 percent) to the rice crop acreage base for the crop for each rice producing farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration.    Producers who knowingly produce rice in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any rice acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm.                    <USBUREAU>Commodity Credit Corporation</USBUREAU>      7 CFR Parts 1413 and 1421         <RINDOCK>RIN 0560&hyph;AD38 </RINDOCK>      1995 Rice Program      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA.       </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Proposed rule.        </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This proposed rule would amend the regulations to set forth the acreage reduction percentage, if any, and the national average price support rate for the 1995 crop of rice.

Environmental Evaluation        It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.       Federal Assistance Program        The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this proposed rule applies, are: Rice Production Stabilization_10.065.       Executive Order 12778        This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not require the exhaustion of any administrative appeal remedies.       Executive Order 12372        This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).       Paperwork Reduction Act        The amendments to 7 CFR part 1413 set forth in this proposed rule do not contain information collections that require clearance by OMB under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35.         Request for Public Comment        Comments are requested with respect to this proposed rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the final rule.       Background        In accordance with section 101B of the 1949 Act, an acreage reduction program (ARP) may be implemented for the 1995 rice crop if it is determined that the total supply of rice, in the absence of such a program, would be excessive taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices, and to meet a national emergency.    Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of rice to desirable goals. A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the considered program options, it is not needed to achieve the statutory stocks-to-use levels of rice.    If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (from 0 to 35 percent) to the rice crop acreage base for the crop for each rice producing farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration.    Producers who knowingly produce rice in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any rice acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm.         </SUPPLEM>

text:   SUMMARY:     This notice proposes to amend special conditions issued to British Aerospace Public Limited Company (BAe) (Currently Jetstream Aircraft Limited) for the BAe Model 4100 airplane. This airplane has a novel or unusual design feature associated with the main cabin aisle arrangement. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 were issued on July 9, 1991, addressing this unusual arrangement, and included a limitation on passenger capacity. The applicant has requested that the special conditions be amended to increase the passenger capacity limit from 29 to 30 passengers. Since the special conditions were issued the applicant has changed the company name and revised the model number of the airplane. This amendment of the special conditions should also reflect these changes. Since the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this particular design feature, this notice contains the additional safety standards which the Administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    Comments Invited          Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of these proposed special conditions by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket or notice number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the Administrator before taking action on this proposal. The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. NM&hyph;53.'' The postcard will be date/time stamped, and returned to the commentor.        Background        On May 24, 1989, BAe Public Limited Company (currently Jetstream Aircraft Ltd.) applied for a type certificate for the BAe Model 4100 (currently Jetstream Model 4101) airplane in the transport airplane category. The Model 4100 was to be a derivative of the Model 3100, which is a small airplane and is certificated under the provisions of part 23. Like the Model 3100, the Model 4100 was a low wing, twin engine turbo-prop design. The fuselage was stretched, however, to seat 29 passengers in a three-abreast arrangement. Since the Model 4100 airplane had the same fuselage cross section as the Model 3100, it did not have a traditional main cabin aisle arrangement.    Section 25.815 species the minimum aisle width dimensions for transport category airplanes based on the passenger capacity. For airplanes with 20 or more passenger seats, a minimum 15-inch width at heights 25 inches or less above the main aisle floor and a minimum 20-inch width at heights greater than 25 inches above the floor must be maintained. Aisle width is measured at any point along the aisle, normal to the centerline of the aisle. The main aisle envisioned by the regulations would run in a straight line from one end of the passenger cabin to the other and would satisfy these width criteria. Long standing FAA policy has permitted slight deviation from a straight line where there is a transition from one cabin section to another, or where there are interior features which dictate that the aisle move laterally. For example, from tourist class to first class there may be a change from five-abreast seating to four-abreast seating which moves the aisle centerline laterally. This has been accepted provided the required widths are maintained at all heights normal to the path that an individual would take. This type of offset normally occurs at one or two points in a main cabin aisle. In addition, there is no offset permitted in the aisle vertically; that is, the required 15-inch dimension must lie completely below the projected 20-inch dimension at all points along the aisle.    The Jetstream main cabin aisle arrangement utilizes an offset at each seat row. The left and right seat assemblies are offset from one another longitudinally such that the seatbacks are not opposite each other across the aisle. This arrangement permits a 20-inch measurement between seatbacks (at an angle to the airplane centerline) and the required 15-inch dimension is maintained within the projected 20-inch dimension vertically. Thus the ``required aisle'' is not a straight line from one end of the cabin to the other, but a series of alternating angular segments from seatback to seatback. Nonetheless, there     is     a straight path along the cabin length, and the aisle floor does not deviate from side to side at all. The projected aisle width along this straight path reaches 20 inches at a height of 43 inches above the floor, which is the typical seatback height for transport airplanes. Another feature of the design includes the use of overwing exits which are offset longitudinally, corresponding to the seat positions on the left and right of the airplane.    In order to provide design standards for the novel and unusual aisle configuration in the BAe Model 4100 airplanes, the FAA issued Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 on July 9, 1991. The criteria used to develop Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 utilized the existing regulations, and made certain favorable design features in the Model 4100 mandatory. Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 are summarized as follows:    a. There are no more than 29 passenger seats with no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle;    b. The interior arrangement includes one pair of Type II and one pair of Type III passenger emergency exits;    c. In addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, the projected aisle width is at least 20 inches measured at a height of 43 inches above the aisle floor;                                      14 CFR Part 25          <RINDOCK>[Docket No. NM&hyph;53; Notice No. SC&hyph;94&hyph;3&hyph;NM]</RINDOCK>        Special Conditions: Jetstream Aircraft Limited Model 4100 Series Airplanes, Main Cabin Aisle Arrangement       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of proposed special conditions.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This notice proposes to amend special conditions issued to British Aerospace Public Limited Company (BAe) (Currently Jetstream Aircraft Limited) for the BAe Model 4100 airplane.

The Type III exits and adjacent seat rows are offset longitudinally such that persons approaching an exit from one end of the cabin may use the exit without interfering with those approaching the other exit from the other end of the cabin;    e. The location and part number of each passenger seat must be defined by a drawing approved by the FAA or foreign civil airworthiness authority. The seat arrangement may not be reconfigured without FAA approval; and    f. An evacuation demonstration must be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the aisle arrangement.    The content of the special conditions was based, in part, on the maximum passenger capacity proposed by BAe. The specific limitation of 29 passenger seats was the maximum capacity requested by BAe, but the FAA considered that the fact that this capacity was well below the maximum that could be allowed for the installed exit combination was a significant factor in acceptance of the aisle arrangement.    Subsequent to issuing the Special Conditions 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 and prior to issuance of the Type Certificate for that project British Aerospace Public Limited Company changed its name to Jetstream Aircraft Limited and changed the model designation for the airplane from BAe Model 4100 to the Jetstream Model 4101. Type Certificate A41NM was issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited on April 9, 1993 for the Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. It is now anticipated that additional models of the 4100 series may be added to this Type Certificate in the future. In addition to the Model 4101, Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 would be applicable to any other Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes that incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle configuration.        Type Certification Basis        Under the provisions of &sect;21.101, Jetstream must show that 30 passenger Model 4100 series airplanes comply with the regulations in the type certification basis established for the 29 passenger Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. The type certification basis for the Model 4101 is as follows:    The certification basis for the Model 4101 is established in accordance with &sect;21.29, using the Joint Aviation Regulations (JAR) as a reference point, with appropriate additional requirements incorporated to provide an equivalent certification basis to the FAR requirements for U.S. certification. British Aerospace and the Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA)&hyph;UK elected to have the type certification basis be the following:           _JAR 25 as amended through Change 12 dated May 10, 1988;    _JAR 25 Orange Paper Amendment 88&hyph;1 effective October 18, 1988;    _JAR 1, definitions as amended through Change 4 dated June 1, 1987; and    _any additional part 25 paragraphs necessary to provide a composite type certification basis equal to the required part 25 type certification basis.           Based on &sect;&sect;21.29 and 21.17 and the type certification application date, the applicable U.S. type certification basis was established as follows:           _Part 25 dated February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;66;    _any applicable special conditions issued;    _any applicable exemptions granted;    _any equivalent safety findings made;    _the fuel venting requirements of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 27, including Amendments 27&hyph;1 through the latest amendment in effect on the date the Model 4100 is type certificated, and    _Part 36, including Amendments 36&hyph;1 through the latest amendment in effect on the date of TC.           If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25 as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.    Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 after public notice, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.17(a)(2).    Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).        Novel or Unusual Design Features        The 30 passenger seat version of the Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes incorporate(s) the same novel or unusual aisle configuration as described above for the 29 seat version.

text: nullnull      As in the case of the 29 seat version, the required main cabin aisle widths would be established using measurements taken between seatbacks, which form a path in angular segments. The aisle width measured normal to the fuselage centerline above 25 inches from the floor, would extend from the seat back to the opposite cabin sidewall. Thus, while the required 15-inch dimension at cabin heights below 25 inches from the floor would be completely within the projected 20-inch width vertically, the 20-inch position would not be centered over the 15-inch position (See Figure 1.)            <BILLING>  BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M   </BILLING>            <IMPORT>       E:GRAPHICSEP13SE94.001        </IMPORT>      <BILLING>  BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;C   </BILLING>       In establishing Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45, the FAA carefully evaluated the relevant design parameters of the BAe Model 4100 and determined that the main aisle configuration is clearly not what was envisioned by the regulations. The regulations do not specifically prohibit the arrangement proposed; however, the policy in effect is predicated on a largely straight aisle which has only one or two lateral deviations; in other words, a traditional cabin arrangement. Therefore, special conditions were developed to establish design criteria which result in a level of safety equivalent to configurations on which the regulations were based.     Jetstream has requested that the FAA amend Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 to allow a maximum passenger capacity of 30, to account for a new customer demand, and be responsive to the market. In their request Jetstream contends that there is no technical basis for the limitation on passenger capacity, and that the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) have, in fact, already granted such approval. Jetstream has proposed that on the basis of harmonization with the JAA, the FAA should consider their request favorably.     Jetstream further contends that the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions for the 29 passenger Model 4101 illustrated that there is no impediment due to the aisle arrangement for 30 passengers. Jetstream argues that the concern that prompted the requirement was therefore demonstrated not to exist.     In developing the special conditions, the FAA took account of the several favorable cabin safety features that the 29 passenger Model 4101 incorporates. One of the major features was the good exit-to-passenger ratio for the number of passengers requested. That is, one pair of Type II exits and one pair of Type III exits for 29 passenger seats, where the regulations allow up to 39. In this regard, 29 passenger seats was the largest arrangement proposed for a US customer. Consequently, the FAA did not consider a greater passenger capacity, and the issue of harmonization did not come up.     With respect to the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions, this demonstration was a modified version of the demonstration specified in part 25, Appendix J. The principal modification was the use of a single exit (in this case, the forward Type I exit) instead of one half of the total number of exits installed. The demonstration was conducted this way in order to provide for maximum usage of the aisle, by the maximum number of passengers. While this demonstration was completed in 54 seconds, the resultant overall rates of egress were not particularly fast for this type of exit. In addition, the evacuees appeared to steady themselves on seatbacks to a higher degree than is typically seen in such demonstrations. Thus, while there was no clear obstruction due to the aisle, the overall egress rates did seem to be somewhat reduced. The FAA therefore considers that the aisle arrangement should result in a limit on maximum passenger capacity that is reduced over the theoretical limit in the regulations.

text: nullnull      Jetstream has requested that the FAA increase the current limit, which they believe is arbitrary, and allow up to 30 passengers in accordance with same special conditions. As noted by the applicant the demonstration conducted for approval of the 29 passenger version Model 4101 did include 30 occupants in the passenger cabin (to account for the JAA approved arrangement) and was completed well within the allowable time. Therefore, from the standpoint of amending the special conditions, an additional demonstration would not be required. While the limit of 29 passengers is somewhat arbitrary, the FAA must consider whether other conditions should apply if the limit is raised.        One of the existing conditions is that there be no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle. The 30 passenger arrangement proposed by Jetstream still complies with this requirement. In fact, the additional seat is located on the left side of the aisle at the extreme rear of the airplane, and does not produce the same kind of aisle offset that occurs throughout the cabin. This is because the seat is opposite a windscreen at which point the aisle leads into the passageway for the aft exit.        These special conditions are intended to provide requirements which result in a cabin aisle that is as effective and safe as those envisioned by the regulations for the maximum number of passengers on the airplane. Where appropriate, requirements have been drawn from existing regulations. In other cases, new requirements were developed to preserve the level of safety which is inherent in the design of more conventional aisle arrangements. The FAA considers that an additional passenger does not invalidate the existing special conditions. It is noted however, that further increase in passenger capacity would violate one of the other conditions because it would result in more than ten seat rows on at least one side of the aisle. Therefore, any increase beyond 30 passenger seats would very likely require the development of additional conditions. As noted above, the FAA has determined that the staggered aisle should limit the passenger seating capacity to something less than would otherwise be allowed by the regulations. Under the terms of these special conditions, 30 is considered to be the reasonable maximum.        As in the case of Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45, an evacuation demonstration would be required for the 30-passenger version. Since the applicant chose to conduct it with 30 rather than 29 passengers, the evacuation demonstration conducted for the 29-passenger version would show compliance with this requirement for the 30-passenger version as well.        Accordingly, in addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, the following amended special conditions are proposed for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes with a staggered main aisle. Other conditions may be developed as needed based on further FAA review and discussions with the manufacturer and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).        As discussed above, the proposed special conditions would be applicable initially to the 30 passenger version of the Jetstream Aircraft Limited Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. Should Jetstream apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model of the 4100 series incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would apply to that model, as well, under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).        Jetstream, in their petition, requested that the amended special conditions be promulgated without delay as a final rule and in time to permit delivery of 30 passenger airplanes during August 1994. The FAA has determined that public comment would be in the public interest, but will shorten the comment period to 20 days in order to expedite the issuance of the final special conditions.          Conclusion            This action affects only certain novel or unusual design features on one Model of airplanes. It is not a rule of general applicability, and it affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane.

There are no more than 30 passenger seats with no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle;        b. The interior arrangement includes on pair of Type II and one pair of Type III passenger emergency exits;        c. In addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, the projected aisle width is at least 20 inches measured at a height of 43 inches above the aisle floor; and        d. The Type III exits and adjacent seat rows are offset longitudinally such that persons approaching an exit from one end of the cabin may use the exit without interfering with those approaching the other exit from the other end of the cabin.        2. The location and part number of each passenger seat must be defined by a drawing approved by the FAA or CAA&hyph;UK. The seat arrangement may not be reconfigured without FAA approval.        3.

The current AD also requires replacement of the clutch assembly at certain time-in-service intervals. This action would require the same inspections and replacements as required by the current AD, but would provide an additional approved replacement part number and provide a reference to three additional manufacturer service documents. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Availability of NPRMs      Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;27&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298.       Discussion       On January 23, 1989, the FAA issued AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09, Amendment 39&hyph;6138 (54 FR 6391, February 10, 1989), to require initial and repetitive inspections of certain main rotor transmission clutch assemblies for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, and improper oil levels. AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 also requires replacement of the main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly) when unairworthy, and establishes a 1,200 hours time-in-service retirement life on the clutch assembly. That action was prompted by several failures of the clutch assembly. Based on an analysis of the clutch assembly failure data, the FAA, in conjunction with The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation and Formsprag, the clutch assembly manufacturer, determined that the clutch assembly,   P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through &hyph;7), could not be safely overhauled and returned to service. The FAA has determined that premature failure of the clutch assembly due to a loss of lubricant creates an unsafe condition. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.   Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has approved the use of clutch assembly, part number (P/N) 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10), in addition to the earlier clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) as replacement clutch assemblies. Additionally, subsequent to the issuance of AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09, The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) issued Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0069, Revision A, dated July 9, 1990, that contains an overhaul time interval for clutch assemblies, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) and P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10). Also, AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 referenced neither Enstrom Service Information Letter (SIL) No. 0084, dated December 19, 1978, pertaining to checking the run-out of the main rotor pinion shaft nor Enstrom SDB No. 0068, dated May 8, 1986, subsequently reissued July 9, 1990, pertaining to the retirement life of the clutch assembly. Finally, a note contained in AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 incorrectly referenced SIL ``0038A''; the reference should have been SIL ``No. 0088, Revision A, dated August 6, 1980.''                   14 CFR Part 39         <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;27&hyph;AD] </RINDOCK>      Airworthiness Directives; The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX Series Helicopters      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).           </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of a certain main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly) for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, or improper oil level and, if necessary, replacement of the clutch assembly.

text: nullnull      Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 to require initial and repetitive inspections of certain clutch assemblies for bearing roughness, noise, lock-up, or improper oil levels and, if necessary, immediate replacement of the clutch assembly. Owner/operator checks are proposed after engine start and rotor engagement to verify proper operation of the clutch assembly and, after each engine shutdown, while the main rotor is still turning down, to check for abnormal noise (such as a clicking or racheting sound) from the upper pulley that houses the clutch assembly. These proposed owner/operator checks do not require the use of tools, precision measuring equipment, training, pilot logbook endorsements, or the use of technical data not contained in the AD. Additionally, these owner/operator checks are considered part of the normal pilot ``Before Takeoff'' and ``After Landing'' checks and were allowed by the existing AD. These owner/operator checks are additional measures to ensure, between 25 hours TIS inspections, that sufficient lubricants are maintained in the clutch assembly and not lost through a leaking seal. These checks may be performed by an owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with sections 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v) of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The proposed AD would also require replacement of the clutch assembly at certain TIS intervals.  The FAA estimates that 162 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $2,800 to overhaul or $10,500 for a zero-time clutch assembly per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be from $471,420, if only overhauled clutch assemblies are installed, to $1,718,820, if only zero-time clutch assemblies are used.   The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.   For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39&hyph;6138 (54 FR 6391, February 10, 1989), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows:                The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom):     Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;27&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09, Amendment 39&hyph;6138.                Applicability:     Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters, certificated in any category.       Compliance:     Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.   To prevent failure of the main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly), loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following:     (a) For Model F&hyph;28, F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, 280, and 280C series helicopters, equipped with clutch assembly part number (P/N) 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through&hyph;7) perform the following:     (1) Before the first flight of each day, before takeoff, gently close the throttle, splitting the tachometer needles to verify proper operation of the clutch assembly. If the tachometer needles do not split, before further flight, inspect the clutch assembly in accordance with paragraph (a)(4).   (2) At the conclusion of the last flight of each day, after engine shutdown, while the main rotor is still running down, listen for any abnormal noise (such as a clicking or racheting sound) from the area of the upper pulley that houses the clutch assembly. If any abnormal noise is heard from the clutch assembly, inspect the clutch assembly in accordance with paragraph (a)(4).   (3) The operational checks required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) may be performed by an owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with 14 CFR 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v).   (4) If any irregularities are noted while performing the procedures required by paragraph (1) or (2), inspect the clutch assembly to determine if it is locked-up, or if the upper pulley will rotate. Rotate it in both directions while feeling for any bearing roughness and listening for any bearing noise. The upper pulley should free-wheel if rotated in a clockwise direction and engage if rotated in a counterclockwise direction.   (5) Within the next 25 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), make an entry in the aircraft log book documenting the clutch assembly part number, the number of hours TIS, and the date.

text:   SUMMARY:     This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH (ECD) Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 series helicopters. This proposal would require a modification of the latches on the transmission and engine cowlings access doors. This proposal is prompted by five occurrences of an engine or transmission cowling access door becoming loose in flight. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the transmission and engine cowling access doors from opening in flight, being struck by the main rotor blade, and subsequently, separating from the helicopter and being ingested by the main rotor or tail rotor system resulting in a loss of control of the helicopter.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Comments Invited       Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire.

text: nullnull      Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other ECD Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 helicopters of the same type design, the proposed AD would require replacing the current latches with those having positive locks, relocating certain latches, and installing additional locks on the transmission and engine cowling access doors within the next 150 hours time-in-service. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.     The FAA estimates that 126 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 45 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $624 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $390,474.     The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.     For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption     ADDRESSES.            List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39         Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.         The Proposed Amendment         Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:         PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES         1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:             Authority:     49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.         &sect;39.13     [Amended]         2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows:               Eurocopter Deutschland GMBH (ECD):     Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;06&hyph;AD.               Applicability:     Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 helicopters, serial numbers 7001 through 7201, certificated in any category.         Compliance:     Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.   To prevent the transmission and engine cowling access doors from opening in flight, being struck by the main rotor blade, and subsequently, separating from the helicopter and being ingested by the main rotor or tail rotor system resulting in a loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following:     (a) Within the next 150 hours time-in-service, remove the left hand and right hand transmission and engine cowlings without removing the transmission and engine cowling access doors that are installed on the transmission and engine cowlings, and modify the access door latches in accordance with the Work Procedure contained in the Accomplishment Instructions of MBB-Helicopters Alert Service Bulletin ASB&hyph;MBB&hyph;BK 117&hyph;20&hyph;104, Revision 1, dated December 8, 1989.     (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Standards Staff, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Standards Staff.               Note:     Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Rotorcraft Standards Staff.           (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulation (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

text:   SUMMARY:     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing to approve Illinois' 1990 base year ozone precursor emissions inventory for certain ozone nonattainment areas as revisions to the Illinois ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP). The emissions inventories were submitted by the State of Illinois to satisfy a Federal requirement that States containing ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions. The Illinois ozone nonattainment areas covered by the ozone emissions inventories addressed in this rulemaking are: Chicago, Metro-East St. Louis, and Jersey County. In the final rules section of this     Federal Register    , the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision request without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and the public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.

text:   SUMMARY:     The EPA proposes interim approval of the Operating Permit Program submitted by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources.      SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           I. Background and Purpose      A. Introduction      As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permit program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permit programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources.  The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.      B. Scope      MPCA's permitting rule, Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7007, combines the State's preconstruction and operating permit programs into a single permitting program. This approval is limited solely to Minnesota's part 70 operating permit program submittal of November, 15, 1993. This is not a rulemaking under section 110 of the Act. The State has submitted a separate request for approval of this rule as a preconstruction permitting program and a federally enforceable state operating permit program as a revision to the State Implementation Plan.  Minnesota's submittal includes a statement that the program will be enforceable in the entire State of Minnesota except Indian tribal lands. Because MPCA has not demonstrated, consistent with applicable principles of Indian law and Federal Indian policies, legal authority to regulate sources on tribal lands, the proposed interim approval of Minnesota's operating permits program will not extend to lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation in the State of Minnesota.    1     Title V sources located within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations in Minnesota will be subject to either the Federal operating permits program, to be promulgated at 40 CFR part 71, or to a tribal operating permits program approved pursuant to title V and the regulations that will be promulgated under section 301(d) of the Act. The section 301(d) regulations will authorize EPA to treat tribes in the same manner as States for appropriate Act provisions.    2                    1      This is not a determination that MPCA could not possibly demonstrate jurisdiction over sources within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations in Minnesota. However, no such showing has been made.                    2      Tribes may also have inherent sovereign authority to regulate air pollutants from sources on tribal lands.          II. Proposed Action and Implications      A. Analysis of State Submission      1. Support Materials   Charles W. Williams, Commissioner, MPCA, submitted Minnesota's part 70 Operating Permit Rule on November 15, 1993, requesting source category-limited interim approval of the State's program. The Commissioner of MPCA has the authority to submit this rule on behalf of the Governor of Minnesota under Minnesota Statutes section 116.03, subdivision 3. The submittal contained all required elements under 40 CFR 70.4, including a description of Minnesota's operating permit program, permitting program documentation, and the Attorney General's legal opinion that the laws of the State of Minnesota provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the program required by the Clean Air Act.      2. Regulations and Program Implementation       The Minnesota permitting regulations (Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7007) substantially meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4, 70.5, and 70.6 with respect to permit content including operational flexibility; 40 CFR 70.7 and 70.8 with respect to permit processing requirements (including public participation and minor permit modifications); and 40 CFR 70.11 with respect to requirements for enforcement authority. The Minnesota permitting regulations meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.2 and 70.3 with respect to applicability and 40 CFR 70.5 with respect to criteria which define insignificant activities and complete application forms.  Minnesota Rules 7007.0100, subpart 26 defines ``Title I modification'' as ``any change that constitutes a modification under any provision of [T]itle I of the Act.'' In addition, Minnesota's rule specifically includes major modifications under parts C and D of title I, modifications subject to a New Source Performance Standard, and modifications subject to a National Emission standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) or any other rules adopted by the Administrator under section 112 of the Act. Commissioner Charles Williams states in his April 19, 1994, letter that Minnesota interprets its definition to include modifications made pursuant to a preconstruction permitting program approved into the State Implementation Plan under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act. The EPA is soliciting comment, as part of the proposal to revise part 70, on the proper definition of ``Title I modifications.'' However, EPA believes that Minnesota's definition, in light of this clarification, would be consistent with any definition of ``Title I modifications'' EPA may adopt.  For further discussion on the State's regulations, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying this approval. The program submittal meets the program requirements of title V and 40 CFR part 70 except as discussing in II.B of this document.      3. Permit Fee Demonstration       Minnesota's fee collection rule, Minnesota Rules 7002.0035, sets the minimum amount of funding the State receives from title V sources by multiplying the number of tons of regulated pollutants listed in the most recent available emissions inventory, with a maximum of 4,000 tons per pollutant per facility, by $25 + the Consumer Price Index (CPI) per ton. However, the current definition of regulated pollutant in MPCA's fee rule (Minnesota Rules 7007.0015, subpart 4) does not include particulate matter greater than 10 microns in diameter, total reduced sulfur, hydrogen chloride, or sulfuric acid mist, all of which are included in the Federal definition. MPCA intends to remedy this discrepancy in a rulemaking scheduled for 1994. When this discrepancy has been corrected, MPCA's fee rule will set the minimum funding the State will receive at the presumptive minimum. However, during the first year after interim approval is granted, the fees that the State of Minnesota will be collecting, which has already been established through the State's regulations, will result in collection of a dollar per ton amount less than the presumptive minimum.  Minnesota will collect $6,558,000 in emission fees for the first year of its program, and has demonstrated that the fees collected will be sufficient to run the program for the first year. However, the fee demonstration in Minnesota's submittal does not contain all information required by 40 CFR 70.9. Specifically, Minnesota's fee demonstration does not contain an estimate of permit program costs for the first four years after program approval. Therefore, the State's fee demonstration may only be given an interim approval.  In order for the State to receive full approval of it's program, the State must either change its definition of regulated air pollutant in its fee rule to include all pollutants included in the Federal definition, or it must submit a four year projection of costs and fees to be collected that demonstrates that the State will collect fees in an amount sufficient to run its program.      4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act           a. Authority and/or Commitments for Section 112 Implementation.     Minnesota has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all section 112 requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in Minnesota's enabling legislation and in regulatory provisions defining ``applicable requirements'' and stating that the permit must incorporate all applicable requirements. EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient to allow Minnesota to issue permits that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements.  EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Minnesota is able to implement and enforce all section 112 requirements. For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying this rulemaking and the April 13, 1993, guidance memorandum titled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for section 112 Activities,'' signed by John Seitz.      b. Implementation of 112(g) Upon Program Approval.     As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Minnesota is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from the date of approval of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) or offsets under section 112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable restrictions on a source-specific basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Minnesota's preconstruction permitting program found in Minnesota Rules Chapter 7007 under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose of implementing section 112(g) during the transition period between title V approval and adoption of a State rule implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA believes this approval is necessary so that Minnesota has a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval. Although section 112(l) generally provides authority for approval of State air toxics programs, title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited approval because of the direct linkage between implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly limited to section 112(g) and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of any other provision under the Act, for example section 110. If Minnesota does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can demonstrate that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, the EPA may, in the final action approving Minnesota's part 70 program, approve the alternative instead.  This approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the State adopts rules implementing regulations promulgated by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval to a reasonable time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Minnesota, acting expeditiously, will be able to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. The EPA is proposing here to limit the duration of this approval to 18 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations. Comment is solicited on whether 18 months is an appropriate period considering Minnesota's procedures for adoption of regulations.      c. Program for Delegation of Section 112 Standards as Promulgated.     Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) approval requirements for approval of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70. Therefore, the EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Minnesota's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated. Minnesota has informed EPA that it intends to accept delegation of section 112 standards through automatic delegation. The details of this delegation mechanism will be set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement between Minnesota and EPA, expected to be completed prior to approval of Minnesota's section 112(l) program for delegation of unchanged Federal standards. This program applies to both existing and future standards, but is limited to sources that will obtain part 70 permits.      d. Title IV.     Minnesota's program contains adequate authority to issue permits which reflect the requirements of title IV and its implementing regulations. In addition, Minnesota's submittal contains a commitment to revise its regulations as necessary to accommodate Federal revisions and additions to title IV and the Acid Rain regulations once they are promulgated.      B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications      The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permit program submitted by Minnesota on November 15, 1993. If this approval is promulgated, the State must make the following changes to receive full approval:          1. Remove from the State's legislation Minnesota Statutes section 609.671, subdivision 14 which provides an exemption from criminal prosecution for sources which give notice of a violation and take reasonable steps to remedy the violation.   2. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 6 to clearly state that all part 70 sources must submit semi-annual reports.   3. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.1400 to be consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(d). Minnesota Rules 7007.1400 provides that the administrative amendment procedure may be used to ``clarify a permit term.'' This ambiguous provision is not consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(d) and could be interpreted broadly enough to allow changes to a permit which should be handled through the permit modification procedures.   4. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 16 to require that the permit terms included in 40 CFR 70.6(a) be expressly stated in part 70 permits. Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 16 allows permit terms which are required by 40 CFR 70.6(a) to be included in the permit by reference to the state regulation. Failure to have these provisions expressly stated in the permit may create difficulties in enforcing those terms and may make it difficult for citizens to understand what provisions apply to a source.   5. Revise the definition of regulated pollutant at Minnesota Rules 7002.0035 to include any ``regulated pollutant for presumptive fee calculation'' as defined at 40 CFR 70.2, or submit a detailed fee demonstration containing all required elements under 40 CFR 70.9.   6. Revise Minn. Rules 7007.0750, subpart 2.C to require the permitting authority to take action on minor and moderate permit amendments within 90 days of receipt of a complete application.          This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to 2 years. During the interim approval period, the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal permit program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.      Minnesota has requested Source Category-Limited (SCL) interim approval of its part 70 operating permit program. Although the State would be required to issue permits within 3 years to all sources subject to the program that obtains interim approval, some sources would not be subject to the requirement to obtain a permit until full approval is granted. Part 70 sources which are not addressed until full approval are also subject to the 3-year time period for processing initial permit applications. The 3-year period for these sources would begin on the date full approval of the State's program is granted. Therefore, initial permitting of all part 70 sources might not be completed until 5 years after interim approval is granted.  Minnesota has presented the following as compelling reasons for why SCL interim approval should be granted in the November 15, 1993, submittal:         1. Minnesota does not have nonattainment areas for ozone. Consequently, Minnesota has not adopted Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology rules, nor does it have its own State air toxics rules. Therefore, MPCA and the facilities regulated by the air toxics program are not familiar with and have not implemented measures to control VOC emissions. MPCA staff and the regulated community will need additional time to catch up with other States in becoming familiar with control techniques and to identify and contact VOC/toxic sources.   2. Minnesota has a variety of large, complex sources which require extensive amounts of time to permit. The time spent issuing permits to these sources will take considerable time away from issuing permits to other sources, making it impossible given MPCA's resource constraints for MPCA to issue permits to all part 70 sources within 3 years.   3. MPCA expects to lose a portion of its experienced permitting engineers to private industry when facilities are required to submit permit applications. The time which is necessary to train new staff as this occurs will increase the amount of time needed to issue a permit.   4. Although MPCA has almost doubled its staff since January of 1992 in anticipation of the workload associated with title V, the workload will surpass available resources. MPCA intends to request additional funding during the 1995 legislative session; however, MPCA will still be unable to take final action on all applications within 3 years.          EPA believes Minnesota has presented compelling reasons for a SCL interim approval.      The EPA believes that a program granted SCL interim approval must apply to at least 60 percent of all part 70 sources, which are responsible for at least 80 percent of the aggregate emissions from all part 70 sources. The EPA requires a demonstration that these criteria are met when a significant percentage of sources or aggregate emissions are excluded from the interim program. The Minnesota submittal which included a schedule for permitting part 70 sources which would permit 60.71 percent of part 70 sources emitting 81.35 percent of aggregate emissions from part 70 sources within 3 years of program approval met the criteria.d.  EPA believes that SCL interim approval is warranted for Minnesota's program. For further discussion on EPA's determination, see the Technical Support Document accompanying this approval.      III. Administrative Requirements      A. Request for Public Comments      The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. Copies of the State's submittal and other information relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional Office. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in the development of this proposed approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:         (1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the approval process; and  (2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The EPA will consider any comments received by October 13, 1994.         B. Executive Order 12866       The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.      C. Regulatory Flexibility Act      Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600     et seq.    , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis  assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  Interim approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal approval of a State operating permit program does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning operating permit programs on such grounds.     Union Electric Co.     v.     U.S. E.P.A.    , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).  If the interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing state requirements nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement.

Background and Purpose      A. Introduction      As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permit program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permit programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources.  The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.      B. Scope      MPCA's permitting rule, Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7007, combines the State's preconstruction and operating permit programs into a single permitting program. This approval is limited solely to Minnesota's part 70 operating permit program submittal of November, 15, 1993. This is not a rulemaking under section 110 of the Act. The State has submitted a separate request for approval of this rule as a preconstruction permitting program and a federally enforceable state operating permit program as a revision to the State Implementation Plan.  Minnesota's submittal includes a statement that the program will be enforceable in the entire State of Minnesota except Indian tribal lands. Because MPCA has not demonstrated, consistent with applicable principles of Indian law and Federal Indian policies, legal authority to regulate sources on tribal lands, the proposed interim approval of Minnesota's operating permits program will not extend to lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation in the State of Minnesota.    1     Title V sources located within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations in Minnesota will be subject to either the Federal operating permits program, to be promulgated at 40 CFR part 71, or to a tribal operating permits program approved pursuant to title V and the regulations that will be promulgated under section 301(d) of the Act. The section 301(d) regulations will authorize EPA to treat tribes in the same manner as States for appropriate Act provisions.    2                    1      This is not a determination that MPCA could not possibly demonstrate jurisdiction over sources within the exterior boundaries of Indian reservations in Minnesota. However, no such showing has been made.                    2      Tribes may also have inherent sovereign authority to regulate air pollutants from sources on tribal lands.          II. Proposed Action and Implications      A. Analysis of State Submission      1. Support Materials   Charles W. Williams, Commissioner, MPCA, submitted Minnesota's part 70 Operating Permit Rule on November 15, 1993, requesting source category-limited interim approval of the State's program. The Commissioner of MPCA has the authority to submit this rule on behalf of the Governor of Minnesota under Minnesota Statutes section 116.03, subdivision 3. The submittal contained all required elements under 40 CFR 70.4, including a description of Minnesota's operating permit program, permitting program documentation, and the Attorney General's legal opinion that the laws of the State of Minnesota provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the program required by the Clean Air Act.      2. Regulations and Program Implementation       The Minnesota permitting regulations (Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7007) substantially meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.4, 70.5, and 70.6 with respect to permit content including operational flexibility; 40 CFR 70.7 and 70.8 with respect to permit processing requirements (including public participation and minor permit modifications); and 40 CFR 70.11 with respect to requirements for enforcement authority. The Minnesota permitting regulations meet the requirements of 40 CFR 70.2 and 70.3 with respect to applicability and 40 CFR 70.5 with respect to criteria which define insignificant activities and complete application forms.  Minnesota Rules 7007.0100, subpart 26 defines ``Title I modification'' as ``any change that constitutes a modification under any provision of [T]itle I of the Act.'' In addition, Minnesota's rule specifically includes major modifications under parts C and D of title I, modifications subject to a New Source Performance Standard, and modifications subject to a National Emission standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) or any other rules adopted by the Administrator under section 112 of the Act. Commissioner Charles Williams states in his April 19, 1994, letter that Minnesota interprets its definition to include modifications made pursuant to a preconstruction permitting program approved into the State Implementation Plan under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act. The EPA is soliciting comment, as part of the proposal to revise part 70, on the proper definition of ``Title I modifications.'' However, EPA believes that Minnesota's definition, in light of this clarification, would be consistent with any definition of ``Title I modifications'' EPA may adopt.  For further discussion on the State's regulations, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying this approval. The program submittal meets the program requirements of title V and 40 CFR part 70 except as discussing in II.B of this document.      3. Permit Fee Demonstration       Minnesota's fee collection rule, Minnesota Rules 7002.0035, sets the minimum amount of funding the State receives from title V sources by multiplying the number of tons of regulated pollutants listed in the most recent available emissions inventory, with a maximum of 4,000 tons per pollutant per facility, by $25 + the Consumer Price Index (CPI) per ton. However, the current definition of regulated pollutant in MPCA's fee rule (Minnesota Rules 7007.0015, subpart 4) does not include particulate matter greater than 10 microns in diameter, total reduced sulfur, hydrogen chloride, or sulfuric acid mist, all of which are included in the Federal definition. MPCA intends to remedy this discrepancy in a rulemaking scheduled for 1994. When this discrepancy has been corrected, MPCA's fee rule will set the minimum funding the State will receive at the presumptive minimum. However, during the first year after interim approval is granted, the fees that the State of Minnesota will be collecting, which has already been established through the State's regulations, will result in collection of a dollar per ton amount less than the presumptive minimum.  Minnesota will collect $6,558,000 in emission fees for the first year of its program, and has demonstrated that the fees collected will be sufficient to run the program for the first year. However, the fee demonstration in Minnesota's submittal does not contain all information required by 40 CFR 70.9. Specifically, Minnesota's fee demonstration does not contain an estimate of permit program costs for the first four years after program approval. Therefore, the State's fee demonstration may only be given an interim approval.  In order for the State to receive full approval of it's program, the State must either change its definition of regulated air pollutant in its fee rule to include all pollutants included in the Federal definition, or it must submit a four year projection of costs and fees to be collected that demonstrates that the State will collect fees in an amount sufficient to run its program.      4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act           a. Authority and/or Commitments for Section 112 Implementation.     Minnesota has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all section 112 requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in Minnesota's enabling legislation and in regulatory provisions defining ``applicable requirements'' and stating that the permit must incorporate all applicable requirements. EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient to allow Minnesota to issue permits that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements.  EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Minnesota is able to implement and enforce all section 112 requirements. For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying this rulemaking and the April 13, 1993, guidance memorandum titled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for section 112 Activities,'' signed by John Seitz.      b. Implementation of 112(g) Upon Program Approval.     As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Minnesota is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from the date of approval of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) or offsets under section 112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable restrictions on a source-specific basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Minnesota's preconstruction permitting program found in Minnesota Rules Chapter 7007 under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose of implementing section 112(g) during the transition period between title V approval and adoption of a State rule implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA believes this approval is necessary so that Minnesota has a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval. Although section 112(l) generally provides authority for approval of State air toxics programs, title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited approval because of the direct linkage between implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly limited to section 112(g) and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of any other provision under the Act, for example section 110. If Minnesota does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can demonstrate that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, the EPA may, in the final action approving Minnesota's part 70 program, approve the alternative instead.  This approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the State adopts rules implementing regulations promulgated by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration of this approval to a reasonable time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Minnesota, acting expeditiously, will be able to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. The EPA is proposing here to limit the duration of this approval to 18 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations. Comment is solicited on whether 18 months is an appropriate period considering Minnesota's procedures for adoption of regulations.      c. Program for Delegation of Section 112 Standards as Promulgated.     Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) approval requirements for approval of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70. Therefore, the EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Minnesota's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated. Minnesota has informed EPA that it intends to accept delegation of section 112 standards through automatic delegation. The details of this delegation mechanism will be set forth in a Memorandum of Agreement between Minnesota and EPA, expected to be completed prior to approval of Minnesota's section 112(l) program for delegation of unchanged Federal standards. This program applies to both existing and future standards, but is limited to sources that will obtain part 70 permits.      d. Title IV.     Minnesota's program contains adequate authority to issue permits which reflect the requirements of title IV and its implementing regulations. In addition, Minnesota's submittal contains a commitment to revise its regulations as necessary to accommodate Federal revisions and additions to title IV and the Acid Rain regulations once they are promulgated.      B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications      The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permit program submitted by Minnesota on November 15, 1993. If this approval is promulgated, the State must make the following changes to receive full approval:          1. Remove from the State's legislation Minnesota Statutes section 609.671, subdivision 14 which provides an exemption from criminal prosecution for sources which give notice of a violation and take reasonable steps to remedy the violation.   2. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 6 to clearly state that all part 70 sources must submit semi-annual reports.   3. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.1400 to be consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(d). Minnesota Rules 7007.1400 provides that the administrative amendment procedure may be used to ``clarify a permit term.'' This ambiguous provision is not consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.7(d) and could be interpreted broadly enough to allow changes to a permit which should be handled through the permit modification procedures.   4. Revise Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 16 to require that the permit terms included in 40 CFR 70.6(a) be expressly stated in part 70 permits. Minnesota Rules 7007.0800, Subpart 16 allows permit terms which are required by 40 CFR 70.6(a) to be included in the permit by reference to the state regulation. Failure to have these provisions expressly stated in the permit may create difficulties in enforcing those terms and may make it difficult for citizens to understand what provisions apply to a source.   5. Revise the definition of regulated pollutant at Minnesota Rules 7002.0035 to include any ``regulated pollutant for presumptive fee calculation'' as defined at 40 CFR 70.2, or submit a detailed fee demonstration containing all required elements under 40 CFR 70.9.   6. Revise Minn. Rules 7007.0750, subpart 2.C to require the permitting authority to take action on minor and moderate permit amendments within 90 days of receipt of a complete application.          This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to 2 years. During the interim approval period, the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal permit program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.      Minnesota has requested Source Category-Limited (SCL) interim approval of its part 70 operating permit program. Although the State would be required to issue permits within 3 years to all sources subject to the program that obtains interim approval, some sources would not be subject to the requirement to obtain a permit until full approval is granted. Part 70 sources which are not addressed until full approval are also subject to the 3-year time period for processing initial permit applications. The 3-year period for these sources would begin on the date full approval of the State's program is granted. Therefore, initial permitting of all part 70 sources might not be completed until 5 years after interim approval is granted.  Minnesota has presented the following as compelling reasons for why SCL interim approval should be granted in the November 15, 1993, submittal:         1. Minnesota does not have nonattainment areas for ozone. Consequently, Minnesota has not adopted Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology rules, nor does it have its own State air toxics rules. Therefore, MPCA and the facilities regulated by the air toxics program are not familiar with and have not implemented measures to control VOC emissions. MPCA staff and the regulated community will need additional time to catch up with other States in becoming familiar with control techniques and to identify and contact VOC/toxic sources.   2. Minnesota has a variety of large, complex sources which require extensive amounts of time to permit. The time spent issuing permits to these sources will take considerable time away from issuing permits to other sources, making it impossible given MPCA's resource constraints for MPCA to issue permits to all part 70 sources within 3 years.   3. MPCA expects to lose a portion of its experienced permitting engineers to private industry when facilities are required to submit permit applications. The time which is necessary to train new staff as this occurs will increase the amount of time needed to issue a permit.   4. Although MPCA has almost doubled its staff since January of 1992 in anticipation of the workload associated with title V, the workload will surpass available resources. MPCA intends to request additional funding during the 1995 legislative session; however, MPCA will still be unable to take final action on all applications within 3 years.          EPA believes Minnesota has presented compelling reasons for a SCL interim approval.      The EPA believes that a program granted SCL interim approval must apply to at least 60 percent of all part 70 sources, which are responsible for at least 80 percent of the aggregate emissions from all part 70 sources. The EPA requires a demonstration that these criteria are met when a significant percentage of sources or aggregate emissions are excluded from the interim program. The Minnesota submittal which included a schedule for permitting part 70 sources which would permit 60.71 percent of part 70 sources emitting 81.35 percent of aggregate emissions from part 70 sources within 3 years of program approval met the criteria.d.  EPA believes that SCL interim approval is warranted for Minnesota's program. For further discussion on EPA's determination, see the Technical Support Document accompanying this approval.      III. Administrative Requirements      A. Request for Public Comments      The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. Copies of the State's submittal and other information relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional Office. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in the development of this proposed approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:         (1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the approval process; and  (2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The EPA will consider any comments received by October 13, 1994.         B. Executive Order 12866       The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.      C. Regulatory Flexibility Act      Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600     et seq.    , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis  assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  Interim approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal approval of a State operating permit program does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning operating permit programs on such grounds.     Union Electric Co.     v.     U.S. E.P.A.    , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).  If the interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing state requirements nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement.

text:   SUMMARY:     Since the mid-1970's, the General Services Administration has imposed rigid building temperature and air circulation standards in the buildings it owns and manages. These standards were established to promote energy conservation without appropriate attention to occupant comfort and productivity. The results of a recent survey of GSA's building occupants showed a low customer satisfaction in the areas of building temperatures and indoor air quality. These results, plus the introduction of new building energy technologies which provide energy conservation without diminution of comfort and service to building occupants, allow GSA to eliminate rigid temperature standards.        This proposed rule will eliminate operating standards and allow for building temperatures to be maintained in a manner satisfactory to users and consistent with local commercial practices. In addition, it will delete the minimum ventilation rate and replace it with the ventilation standards specified by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE Standard 62 Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality). This will improve temperature comfort levels, ventilation, and the indoor air quality of buildings. This will, in turn, improve customer satisfaction and productivity.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Executive Order 12862_Setting Customer Service Standards. Executive Order 12862 states that in order to carry out the principles of the National Performance Review, the Federal Government must be customer-driven. GSA, in an effort to become more customer driven, seeks to improve customer satisfaction, by changing regulations that have a direct effect on three areas of low customer satisfaction. GSA's customers, building tenants, have indicated by their responses to customer surveys that they have very low satisfaction levels for the following: ventilation, 42 percent satisfied; indoor air quality, 44 percent satisfied; summer temperature, 53 percent satisfied; and winter temperature, 56 percent satisfied.        The two sections of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) addressed in this proposal mandate space temperatures and ventilation rates that contribute to low customer satisfaction. These changes will permit the Buildings Managers to control building temperatures and mandate adherence to the latest air ventilation guidelines. On April 11, 1994 the Administrator of GSA granted a class deviation for the two sections of the FPMR. This action made the changes recommended in this proposed rule effective immediately for GSA buildings.        Executive Order 12866        The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866.        Regulatory Flexibility Act        GSA has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).

text:   SUMMARY:     In this document, NHTSA proposes technical amendments to the insurance cost information regulations. Among the proposed changes are revising the term ``passenger motor vehicles'' to read ``passenger cars, utility vehicles, light duty trucks, and vans,'' and revising from January to March, the availability date of the insurance information. NHTSA also proposes making more explicit the limitations of the collision loss data, and proposes recommending that prospective purchasers contact insurance agents for more information. The technical amendments are proposed to make the insurance cost information more accurate.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Background       Insurance Cost Information Regulation       49 U.S.C. 32302(c) states that the Secretary of Transportation (the Secretary) shall prescribe regulations that require passenger motor vehicle dealers to distribute to prospective purchasers information developed by the Secretary and provided to the dealer which compares differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger motor vehicles based upon differences in damage susceptibility and crashworthiness. By delegation from the Secretary, NHTSA has been authorized to carry out the statute.     On January 31, 1975, NHTSA published 49 CFR part 582, Insurance Cost Information Regulation (40 FR 4918). Part 582, as then promulgated, required that automobile dealers ``make available to prospective purchasers information reflecting differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger motor vehicles based upon differences in damage susceptibility and crashworthiness.'' Part 582, however, did not specify information that dealers must provide.     On March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12545), NHTSA published a final rule amending part 582. The rule complemented the 1975 rulemaking, and completed implementation of section 32302(c). The March 1993 final rule, which became effective April 5, 1993, requires dealers of new automobiles to make collision loss experience data available in booklets to prospective purchasers. The information to be provided in the booklet is specified in section 582.5, which requires inclusion of a complete explanatory text and updated data on auto insurance costs published annually by NHTSA.     The mandatory text specified by part 582 relates to, among other topics, the limitations of the auto insurance cost data as a predictor of differences in insurance premiums. Essentially, those limitations result from the fact that most of the factors that insurance companies use to establish premiums relate to driver characteristics and, except for the vehicle's value, are not directly related to the vehicle itself. Thus, as the text explains, the fact that a vehicle's historical claims experience is somewhat better or worse than that of other vehicles in its class may not be reflected in the premium that an insurance company establishes for that vehicle. If the claims experience is reflected, it is likely to have only a small impact on the premium.                                  <USBUREAU>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</USBUREAU>        49 CFR Part 582         <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 94&hyph;73; Notice 1] </RINDOCK>              Insurance Cost Information Regulation      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.       </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of proposed rulemaking.        </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     In this document, NHTSA proposes technical amendments to the insurance cost information regulations.

Part 582, however, did not specify information that dealers must provide.     On March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12545), NHTSA published a final rule amending part 582. The rule complemented the 1975 rulemaking, and completed implementation of section 32302(c). The March 1993 final rule, which became effective April 5, 1993, requires dealers of new automobiles to make collision loss experience data available in booklets to prospective purchasers. The information to be provided in the booklet is specified in section 582.5, which requires inclusion of a complete explanatory text and updated data on auto insurance costs published annually by NHTSA.     The mandatory text specified by part 582 relates to, among other topics, the limitations of the auto insurance cost data as a predictor of differences in insurance premiums. Essentially, those limitations result from the fact that most of the factors that insurance companies use to establish premiums relate to driver characteristics and, except for the vehicle's value, are not directly related to the vehicle itself. Thus, as the text explains, the fact that a vehicle's historical claims experience is somewhat better or worse than that of other vehicles in its class may not be reflected in the premium that an insurance company establishes for that vehicle. If the claims experience is reflected, it is likely to have only a small impact on the premium.           </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      The mandatory text also urges consumers to contact insurance companies if they wish to obtain precise information about actual premiums for particular makes and models of vehicles. Previous studies by NHTSA have revealed that the difference between the premiums charged by different insurance companies for the same car and driver is greater than the difference between the premiums charged by a given company for comparably-valued cars that have different claims experience. NHTSA believed the mandatory text would help to minimize consumer confusion by providing customers with an understanding of the uses and limitations of the auto insurance cost data.   In specifying the yearly insurance cost data that accompanied the required text, NHTSA decided to rely on collision loss experience data collected and reported by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), as the best available indicator of the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance costs.   In the March 1993 final rule, NHTSA specified HLDI's December Insurance Collision Report as the data source for part 582. NHTSA decided to specify HLDI's December Report because it contains more current data and covers more vehicle models than other HLDI publications. The HLDI data is presented in a format that ranks the vehicles in each class from best to worst (with numerical values given for each vehicle). NHTSA specified this format because it determined the use of this ranking system should assist customers in evaluating the comparative performance of comparable vehicles.   In the March 1993 final rule, NHTSA stated its belief that the HLDI information should be available as soon as possible after its publication date. Therefore, NHTSA stated its intent to publish the annual     Federal Register     document updating HLDI's December Insurance Collision Report data no later than January of the calendar year that follows HLDI's publication of the data.       Proposed Amendments       In this notice of proposed rulemaking, NHTSA proposes to amend part 582 by making certain changes in section 582.5, that specifies the text of the insurance cost information booklet. At present, the text specifies the date ``January [Year to be Inserted].'' In this NPRM, NHTSA proposes to revise ``January'' to ``March.'' The change to a later month will allow NHTSA adequate time to publish the comparative insurance cost information booklet. HLDI sends the December Insurance Collision Report data to NHTSA in mid-January. The data is then formatted for printing and distributed to automobile dealers by mail. NHTSA can thus expect that the booklet will be published by March of each year.   Part 582 presently specifies a comparison of insurance costs for ``passenger motor vehicles.'' In this NPRM, NHTSA proposes to revise ``passenger motor vehicles,'' at appropriate places in &sect;582.5, to read ``passenger cars, utility vehicles, light duty trucks and vans.'' The proposed revisions would make clear that ``passenger motor vehicles'' includes many vehicle types besides ``passenger car.''   In this NPRM, NHTSA also proposes to make certain changes to the required text that would make more explicit the limitations of the collision loss data. At present, the text in &sect;582.5 explaining the data's limitations states that the collision loss data table does not include information about new models, models that have been substantially redesigned, and models without enough claim experience. In order to make clear that certain data should not be relied upon, NHTSA proposes to revise the third paragraph in &sect;582.5 to state:          The table is not relevant for new models or models that have been substantially redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED], and it does not include information about models without enough claim experience.          At present, the fourth paragraph in &sect;582.5 states that it is unlikely that a consumer's total premium will vary more than five percent depending upon the collision loss experience of a particular vehicle. Upon further review, NHTSA believes it would be more accurate to state that it is unlikely that a consumer's total premium will vary more than ten percent. This notice proposes that change.   The reason for the change to ten percent is that the Insurance Services Organization (ISO) recommends insurance premium rates to its members. An ISO representative indicated to NHTSA that the collision cost data could result in an insurance premium reduction of ten percent rather than the five percent mentioned in the booklet ``Comparison of Differences in Insurance Costs for Passenger Motor Vehicles on the Basis of Damage Susceptibility,'' made available to motor vehicle purchasers.

text: nullnull      Finally, at present, &sect;582.5 states that to determine the actual premium that a consumer will be charged for insuring a particular vehicle or for complete information about insurance premiums, the consumer should contact insurance companies directly. In this proposed rule, NHTSA proposes that &sect;582.5 be revised to advise the consumer to contact insurance company     agents     directly. Amending the text to advise the consumer to contact the insurance company agents directly, reflects the fact that the consumer's first point of contact with insurance companies is the insurance company agent.       Regulatory Impacts         1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures       This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action and has determined the action not to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The agency has determined that the economic effects of the proposed amendments are minimal, so that a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This NPRM proposes minor amendments to the insurance cost information regulation, so that the information to be provided to potential motor vehicle purchasers is more accurate. Assuming these proposals are adopted, any extra text that must be included in the information booklet would be minuscule.       2. Regulatory Flexibility Act       In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this notice of proposed rulemaking on small entities. NHTSA estimates there are about 24,000 dealers of new passenger motor vehicles. Many of the dealers would be considered small entities, that may be affected by this proposed rule. However, NHTSA believes that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of these small dealers. The rationale is that this rulemaking proposes minor editorial changes, resulting in a small amount of extra text in the insurance cost information booklet. The potential cost increments associated with this proposed rule should have negligible effects on the purchase price of new passenger motor vehicles. For these reasons, I certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.       3. National Environmental Policy Act       In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the agency has considered the environmental impacts of this proposed rule and determined that if made final, it will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.       4. Federalism       This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12623, and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.       5. Civil Justice Reform       This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect, and it does not preempt any State law. Chapter 323_    Consumer Information     of 49 U.S.C. does not provide for judicial review of rules issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 32302. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701     et seq.    , provides generally for judicial review of final agency action, which in certain circumstances may include this proposed rule. The Administrative Procedure Act does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.       Procedures for Filing Comments       NHTSA solicits public comments on the issues presented in this notice. It is requested, but not required, that 10 copies be submitted.   All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21.) Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15 page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion.   If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation. 49 CFR part 512.   All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for this notice will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments on this notice will be available for inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available for inspection in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.

List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 582       Administrative practice and procedure, Insurance, Motor Vehicles.            In consideration of the foregoing, NHTSA proposes to amend 49 CFR part 582 as follows:         PART 582_[AMENDED]       1. The authority citation for part 582 would be revised to read as follows:                Authority:     49 U.S.C. 32302, 32303; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.51.            2. Section 582.5 would be revised to read as follows:       &sect;582.5     Information form.       The information made available pursuant to &sect;582.4 shall be presented in writing in the English language and in not less than 10-point type. It shall be presented in the format set forth below, and shall include the complete explanatory text and the updated data published annually by NHTSA.       MARCH [YEAR TO BE INSERTED]   COMPARISON OF DIFFERENCES IN INSURANCE COSTS FOR PASSENGER CARS, UTILITY VEHICLES, LIGHT DUTY TRUCKS, AND VANS ON THE BASIS OF DAMAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY      The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has provided the information in this booklet in compliance with Federal law as an aid to consumers considering the purchase of a new vehicle. The booklet compares differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks and vans on the basis of damage susceptibility. However, it does not indicate a vehicle's relative safety.   The following table contains the best available information regarding the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance premiums. It was taken from data compiled by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) in its December [YEAR TO BE INSERTED]     Insurance Collision Report,     and reflects the collision loss experience of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks, and vans sold in the United States in terms of the average loss payment per insured vehicle year for [THREE APPROPRIATE YEARS TO BE INSERTED]. NHTSA has not verified the data in this table.   The table represents vehicles' collision loss experience in relative terms, with 100 representing the average for all passenger vehicles. Thus, a rating of 122 reflects a collision loss experience that is 22 percent higher (worse) than average, while a rating of 96 reflects a collision loss experience that is 4 percent lower (better) than average. The table is not relevant for new models or models that have been substantially redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED], and it does not include information about models without enough claim experience.   Although many insurance companies use the HLDI information to adjust the ``base rate'' for the collision portion of their insurance premiums, the amount of any such adjustment is usually small. It is unlikely that your total premium will vary more than ten percent depending upon the collision loss experience of a particular vehicle.     If you do not purchase collision coverage or your insurance company does not use the HLDI information, your premium will not vary at all in relation to these rankings.   In addition, different insurance companies often charge different premiums for the same driver and vehicle. Therefore, you should contact insurance company agents directly to determine the actual premium that you will be charged for insuring a particular vehicle.                Please Note    : In setting insurance premiums, insurance companies mainly rely on factors that are not directly related to the vehicle itself (except for its value). Rather, they mainly consider driver characteristics (such as age, gender, marital status, and driving record), the geographic area in which the vehicle is driven, how many miles are traveled, and how the vehicle is used. Therefore, to obtain complete information about insurance premiums, you should contact insurance company agents directly.           Insurance companies do not generally adjust their premiums on the basis of data reflecting the crashworthiness of different vehicles. However, some companies adjust their premiums for personal injury protection and medical payments coverage if the insured vehicle has features that are likely to improve its crashworthiness, such as air bags and automatic seat belts.   Test data relating to vehicle crashworthiness are available from NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). NCAP test results demonstrate relative frontal crash protection in new vehicles. Information on vehicles that NHTSA has tested in the NCAP program can be obtained by calling the agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at (800) 424&hyph;9393.

text: nullnull      Regulatory History       On April 19, 1990, the Coast Guard published a notice   of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for Commercial Fishing   Industry Vessels (55 FR 14924). In the NPRM, the Coast   Guard proposed to regulate U.S. documented or state numbered   uninspected fishing, fish processing, and fish tender   vessels, including vessels engaged in the Aleutian Trade, to   implement the provisions of the Commercial Fishing Industry   Vessel Safety Act of 1988. Subsequent to the NPRM, Congress   enacted the Aleutian Trade Act of 1990 (ATA), significantly   affecting the impact of the proposed regulations on vessels   engaged in the Aleutian trade. The ATA provides for   continued cargo service to remote communities in Alaska   while ensuring increased safety standards for fish tender   vessels operating in the Aleutian trade. As a result of the   ATA, the Coast Guard published a supplemental notice of   proposed rulemaking, (SNPRM), in the     Federal Register     on   October 27, 1992 (57 FR 48670).   In response to the SNPRM, the Coast Guard received over   206 comments specifically opposing, and only 4 comments   favoring, the proposed ATA regulations. In a second SNPRM,   the Coast Guard is now proposing to increase the safety   standards for these vessels consistent with the comments   received to the first SNPRM and establish a separate subpart   in 46 CFR Part 28 for vessels engaged in the Aleutian trade.       Background and Purpose           The Aleutian Trade Act of 1990.     On November 16, 1990, the President signed Pub. L. 101&hyph;595, The Aleutian Trade Act of 1990 (``the ATA''). The ATA   applies only to fish tender vessels engaged in the   transportation of cargo (including fishery related products)   for hire to or from a place in Alaska west of 153  &cir; West   longitude and east of 172  &cir; East longitude and only, if that   place receives weekly common carrier service by water, to or   from a place in the United States (except a place in   Alaska). The ATA requires these fish tender vessels to meet   new safety and manning standards over a specified period of   time. Additional background information concerning the ATA   and the Coast Guard's interpretation of the Act, may be   found at page 48670 of the SNPRM published October 27, 1992.       Discussion of Comments       In response to the SNPRM of October 27, 1992, the Coast   Guard received four comments supporting the ATA. They were   from a common carrier, a ship yard, a naval architect and an   interested party that did not identify its affiliation.   Additionally, the Coast Guard received 206 comments opposing   the ATA. These comments were from fishermen, fishing vessel   companies, naval architects, shipyards, the State   Legislature and Governor of Alaska, an insurance company,   and the general public.   The primary objections to the proposed requirements   were: (1) The potential for severe economic hardship to the   operators of ATA vessels, and the people and companies the   vessels serve in the outlying areas; (2) the possibility   that common carriers serving the Aleutian area would have a   monopoly on seaborne commerce in this area and could   significantly increases rates; and (3) the lack of need for   additional regulations when considering the positive safety   record of ATA vessels. Additionally, comments opposed the   proposed rules by arguing that: (1) The Coast Guard greatly   underestimated the cost of compliance; (2) the Commercial   Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act states that the Coast   Guard cannot require alterations to existing vessels; and   (3) the standards proposed are excessive and greater than   those required of an inspected cargo vessel.       Discussion of Proposed Rules       In response to the large number of comments opposing   the first SNPRM, the Coast Guard will revise its proposed   regulations and issue a second SNPRM. The Coast Guard   believes this SNPRM proposes standards that would upgrade   safety requirements aboard ATA vessels and yet be responsive   to the comments received to the first SNPRM. In this SNPRM,   the Coast Guard is proposing a new subpart G, to be entitled   Aleutian Trade Act Vessels. Each section is summarized in   the following paragraphs.       Subpart A_General Provisions       Section 28.040&blank;Incorporation by Reference       This section lists the industry standards that are   incorporated by reference and the corresponding sections   where each standard is reference as the governing   requirement.   In the interest of keeping the regulations as   uncomplicated as possible, the number of standards   incorporated by reference has been minimized.   National Fire Protection Association, NFPA, sections   310&hyph;13 and 310&hyph;15 of NFPA 70 is referenced in &sect;28.865.   Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE, section J1475 is   needed for compliance in &sect;28.880.   Underwriters Laboratories, UL, standard 217&hyph;1985,   ``Single and Multiple Station Smoke Detectors'' to supplement   the information in &sect;28.830       Subpart G_Aleutian Trade Act Vessels       Section 28.800&blank;Applicability and General Requirements      This section describes the revised applicability for   ATA vessels proposed for this subpart. Fish tender vessels   engaged in the Aleutian trade are subject to inspection   under the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 3301 (1), (6), or (7)   except those that:   1. Are not more than 500 gross tons;   2. Have an incline test performed by a marine surveyor; and   3. Have written stability instructions posted on board the   vessel.       Section 28.805&blank;Launching of Survival Craft      This section would require ATA vessels to comply with   46 CFR subpart B, which requires inflatable liferafts (SOLAS   A Packs) for 100% complement coverage. To facilitate the   manual launching of survival craft which have a mass of more   than 110 pounds, (50 kg), each vessel must have a gate or   another opening in its bulwarks, deck rails, or lifelines.       Section 28.810&blank;Deck Rails, Lifelines, Storm Rails and Hand Grabs      This section would adopt the same requirements of   subpart D, which are essentially identical to those found in   subchapter I.       Section 28.815&blank;Bilge Pumps, Bilge Piping, and Dewatering Systems      This section would require two power bilge pumps, each   with a separate source of power (e.g. one electric pump and   one mechanically driven or power take-off (PTO) pump)   connected to a fixed system. However, a portable powered   pump could substitute for one of the required pumps as long   as it meets specific criteria as promulgated in these   regulations. In contrast, subpart D requires one powered   bilge pump connected to a fixed system while subchapter I   requires three powered pumps for cargo vessels.

In addition, a portable   pump must be carried that has a capacity of 9500 gallons per   hour and is capable of being connected to the firemain and   hoses. However, if the vessel already has a portable pump   satisfying the second bilge pump requirement, no additional   portable pump would be required as long as it is properly   equipped to handle both firefighting and flood control.         Section 28.825&blank;Excess Fire Detection and Protection Equipment         This section would cover excess fire detection and   protection equipment and is in lieu of &sect;28.155.         Section 28.830&blank;Fire Detection System        This section would grandfather existing systems and   equipment within specific limits and regulations, and   provides acceptance latitude. It would require that   accommodation spaces to be fitted with modular smoke   detectors, and require manual remote shutdown of certain   machinery outside of certain spaces.         Section 28.835&blank;Fuel Systems         This section would incorporate applicable regulations   of subchapter F for any replacement and or alteration to the   existing grandfathered piping. It would also add the   requirement for remote shutoff valves on certain fuel tanks,   metal shields under filters, and limits the length of   nonmetallic flexible hose used (for vibration purposes   only).                 Note:     Some of the piping aboard ex-Navy yard oilers   used in the Aleutian trade was built and installed to Navy   specifications and was encased in cement ballast. This   arrangement would be grandfathered. In contrast, subpart D   requires all fuel lines to be constructed of seamless   material only, except short lengths of flex hose for   vibration. Cargo vessels have the same requirements and,   additionally, all valves and fittings must meet specific   regulations of subchapter F.         Section 28.840&blank;Means for Stopping Pumps, Ventilation, and   Machinery         This section would contain requirements for remote   controls similar to those applicable to cargo vessels.         Section 28.845&blank;General Requirements for Electrical Systems         This section would adopt nearly all of the requirements   of subpart D which provide for acceptance of recognized   standards such as Underwriters Laboratory (UL). An added   grandfathering clause would allow acceptance of existing   materials and installations, on a case by case basis. For   example, existing cables and wiring runs could be allowed to   remain as presently constructed and routed. However, any   replacement wiring or new installations would have to meet   specific requirements. In comparison, the installation of   all electrical systems and interior communications as to   design, construction, and material acceptance for cargo   vessels must be done in accordance with subchapter J.         Section 28.850&blank;Main Source of Electrical Power         This section proposes general requirements for   electrical systems that are presently found on ATA vessels.

text: nullnull      Section 28.855&blank;Electrical Distribution Systems       This section requires that a distribution system which   has neutral bus or conductor have the neutral bus or   conductor grounded. It also requires a grounded   distribution system to have only one connection to ground.   The one connection to ground must be at the switchboard, or   on a nonmetallic vessel at the common ground point.       Section 28.860&blank;Overcurrent Protection and Switched Circuits       This section would require the same standards found in   subpart D, which are similar to the requirements for   inspected vessels contained in 46 CFR subchapter J_  Electrical Engineering Regulations.       Section 28.865&blank;Wiring Methods and Materials       This section would require the same standards for wires   and conductors found in subpart D.       Section 28.870&blank;Emergency Source of Electrical Power       This section would require an emergency source of   electrical power which is capable of supplying connected   loads for at least 3 hours and which is physically separated   from the main machinery space. This segregation would help   ensure that one casualty did not disable all sources of   electrical power. If the source is a battery, specific   regulations would have to be satisfied. Note: No emergency   generator is required_it is believed the combination of a   duty engineer and back-up fire &amp; bilge pumps as well as   additional powered portable pump should be sufficient.   Subpart D requires an independent source of electrical power   located outside the machinery space capable of supplying all   loads listed above plus the steering gear, and fire &amp; bilge   pumps continuously for 3 hours. Cargo vessels require   emergency lighting for 6 hours.       Section 28.875&blank;Radar, Depth Sounding, and Auto-pilot       This section would adopt the equipment requirements of   subpart D for radar and depth sounding devices. In   addition, procedures would be proposed for the use of an   auto-pilot.       Section 28.880&blank;Hydraulic Equipment       This section would grandfather some existing hydraulic   hose runs and materials. It provides specifics for fluid,   hose, fittings, and compatibility for use. It adds the   requirement for fail-safe system components and provides   requirements that enhance operator safety. It reduces   existing overuse of nonmetallic hydraulic flex hose by   limiting its use in runs where flexibility is not   specifically required. However, any retrofit of hydraulic   hoses would have to be accomplished over a period of time,   such as replacing the flex hose with hard piping only   whenever renewals, replacements or alterations are being   accomplished. In comparison, subpart D specifically limits   the allowable length of nonmetallic flexible hose to 30  &rsquo;  &rsquo;   while subchapter I requires specific material approval in   applicable sections of subchapter F.       Section 28.885&blank;Cargo Gear       This section would take the cargo equipment found   presently on these vessels and incorporate them with   subchapter I requirements.

text: nullnull      Section 28.890&blank;Examination and Certification of Compliance         This section would require that each ATA vessel be   examined for compliance once every two years. The   examination would be performed by the American Bureau of   Shipping (ABS), a similarly qualified organization, or   another accepted organization. The organization performing   the examination would be required to provide the owner and   the cognizant Coast Guard District Commander, (Attention:   Fishing Vessel Safety Coordinator) with a copy of the signed   certification letter if the vessel was found to be in   compliance. A copy of a certification letter would also be   required to be maintained on board the vessel.   With respect to the inspection provisions, 46 U.S.C. 3302(c)   was amended by exempting fishing, fish processing, and fish   tender vessels of not more than 500 gross tons from   consideration as a freight vessel, a seagoing barge, or a   seagoing motor vessel under 46 U.S.C. 3301 (1), (6), and (7)   if, when the vessel transports cargo to or from Alaska, that   place does not receive weekly common carrier service by   water from a place in the United States; or the cargo is of   a type not accepted by that common carrier service; or in   the case of a fish tender vessel, the vessel is not engaged   in the Aleutian trade.     A fish tender vessel engaged in the Aleutian trade is   not subject to inspection under the provisions of 46 U.S.C.   3301 (1), (6), and (7), if the vessel is not more than 500   gross tons, has an incline test performed by a marine   surveyor, and has written stability instructions posted on   board. These provisions were effective May 16, 1991.         Section 28.895&blank;Survey and Classification         This proposed section would require each ATA vessel   which undergoes a major conversion completed after July 27,   1990, to be classed by the ABS or another organization   determined by the Commandant to be similarly qualified.         Section 28.900&blank;Loadlines         This section would require that a fish tender vessel of   not more than 500 gross tons, engaged in the Aleutian trade,   obtain a loadline certificate.         Section 28.905&blank;Post Accident Inspection         This proposed section was suggested by a common carrier   during the first SNPRM to require that an ATA vessel undergo   a general or partial survey by a Coast Guard Representative   following an accident or if a defect is discovered which   affects the safety of the vessel. This requirement would be   similar to that found in subchapter I for cargo vessels,   however a third party would be conducting this post accident   inspection.         Section 28.910&blank;Repairs and Alterations         This proposed section, again suggested during the first   SNPRM, would require the managing operators of an ATA vessel   to notify a Coast Guard Representative prior to making   repairs or alterations to an ATA vessel that may affect the   safety of the vessel.         Section 28.915&blank;Manning and Crew         This proposed section would establish manning   requirements for a fish tender vessel of not more than 500   gross tons, engaged in the Aleutian trade.     This section also proposes that machinery spaces be   under the control, when at sea, of an engineer designated as   in charge. This designation may be: (a) In writing by the   owner, operator, or master; (b) by an entry in the ship's   log if one is maintained; or (c) by a designation on the   emergency instructions required under &sect;28.265. If   designated engineers are not part of the vessel's   complement, then all the requirements of subpart D would   have to be met in addition to this subpart. Any component   or system on a vessel found to be in conflict between the   regulations found in subparts D and G, then the higher   standard will apply. ATA amended 46 U.S.C. 8702 to require   that a fish tender vessel engaged in the Aleutian trade   comply with the crew requirements set out in &sect;8702, but   allowed the percentage of the deck crew, who are required to   have merchant mariners documents endorsed for a rating of at   least able seaman, to be reduced from 65 to 50 percent of   crew size. These provisions were effective November 16,   1991.     Lastly, the ATA amended 46 U.S.C. Chapter 73 to allow   acceptance of service on an ATA vessel to be used by an   individual to qualify for an endorsement as an ``able   seaman_fishing industry'', ``able seaman_unlimited'' or   ``able seaman_special.'' If the service is on board a   vessel of at least 100 gross tons, the service may be   accepted to qualify as an ``able seaman_limited''.         Incorporation by Reference

Copies of this material will be available for   inspection where indicated under     ADDRESSES    , and from the   sources listed in &sect;28.040.   Before publishing a final rule, the Coast Guard will   submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register   for approval of the incorporation by reference.       Regulatory Evaluation       This proposal is not a significant regulatory action   under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not   require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under   section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by   the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is   not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures   of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040;   February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic   impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full   Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory   policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.   The Coast Guard estimates that only 20 vessels out of   an estimated U.S. commercial fishing fleet in excess of   120,000 vessels would be affected by this rule. This   proposed rule includes a number of grandfathered provisions.   Therefore, the Coast Guard believes that existing equipment   onboard these 20 vessels should be upgraded and replaced   only when the existing equipment is no longer serviceable.       Small Entities       Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et   seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal,   if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a   substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may   include: (1) Small businesses and not-for-profit   organizations that are independently owned and operated and   are not dominant in their fields; and (2) governmental   jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.   An estimated 20 commercial fishing industry vessels are   involved in the Aleutian Trade Act. A number of these   vessels are owned or operated by small entities. However,   the Coast Guard estimates that the cost of complying with   these revised proposed regulations will be minor. Because   it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the   Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this   proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic   impact on a substantial number of small entities. If   however, you think that your business qualifies as a small   entity and that this proposal will have a significant   economic impact on your business, please submit a comment   (see     ADDRESSES    ) explaining why you think your business   qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal   will economically affect your business.

Federalism      The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This notice proposes regulations for ATA vessels only. Since this rule affects specific vessels both inside and outside state waters, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State action addressing the same subject matter.      Environment      The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.lB, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. These proposed rules are to enhance certain safety equipment requirements and general operating procedures of ATA vessels and have no significant effect on the environment.

text: nullnull      Subpart G_Aleutian Trade Act Vessels    &sect;28.800     Applicability and General Requirements.         (a) This subpart applies to each fish tender vessel   engaged in the Aleutian trade that has not undergone a major   conversion and:     (1) Was operated in the Aleutian trade before September   8, 1990; or     (2) Was purchased to be used in the Aleutian trade   before September 8, 1990, and entered into service in the   Aleutian trade before June 1, 1992.     (b) Except as noted otherwise in this subpart, a vessel   subject to this subpart must also comply with the   requirements of subparts A, B, and C of this part.     (c) Each fish tender vessel engaged in the Aleutian trade   that undergoes a major conversion after September 15, 1991   must comply with the additional requirements of   subpart D of this part.     (d) A fish tender vessel engaged in the Aleutian trade is   subject to inspection under the provisions of 46 U.S.C. 3301 (1), (6), or (7) unless it:     (1) Is not more than 500 gross tons;     (2) Has an incline test performed by a marine surveyor;   and     (3) Has written stability instructions posted on board   the vessel.     (e) A vessel that does not have a designated engineer as   part of its complement must comply with the requirements of   subpart D of this part in addition to the requirements of   this subpart.         &sect;28.805     Launching of survival craft.         In addition to the survival craft requirements in subpart   B of this part, each vessel must have a gate or other opening in the deck   rails, lifelines, or bulwarks adjacent to the stowage   location of each survival craft which has a mass of more than   110 pounds (50 KG), so that the survival craft can be   manually launched.         &sect;28.810     Deck rails, lifelines, storm rails and hand grabs.         (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this   section, deck rails, lifelines, grab rails, or equivalent   protection must be installed near the periphery of all   weather decks accessible to individuals. Where space   limitations make deck rails impractical, hand grabs may be   substituted.     (b) The height of deck rails, lifelines, or bulwarks must   be at least 391/2 inches (1 meter) from the deck, except   where this height would interfere with the normal operation   of the vessel, a lesser height may be substituted.     (c) All deck rails or lifelines must be permanently   supported by stanchions at intervals of not more than 7 feet (2.3 meters). Stanchions must be through bolted or welded to   the deck.     (d) Portable stanchions and lifelines may be installed in   locations where permanently installed deck rails would impede   normal cargo operations or emergency recovery operations.     (e) Deck rails or lifelines must consist of evenly spaced   courses. The spacing between courses must not be greater   than 15 inches (0.38 meters). The opening below the lowest   course must not be more than 9 inches (0.23 meters). Lower   courses are not required where all or part of the space below   the upper rail is fitted with a bulwark, chain link fencing,   wire mesh, or an equivalent.     (f) A suitable storm rail or hand grab must be installed   where necessary in a passageway, at a deckhouse side, at a   ladder, and a hatch where an individual might have access.       &sect;28.815     Bilge pumps, bilge piping, and dewatering systems.       Instead of &sect;28.255, each vessel to which this subpart   applies must meet the following requirements:     (a) Each vessel must be equipped with a fixed, self   priming, powered, bilge pump connected to a bilge manifold   and piping capable of draining any watertight compartment,   other than tanks and small buoyancy compartments, under all   service conditions. Large spaces, such as engine rooms and   cargo holds, must be fitted with more than one suction line.     (b) In addition, each vessel must be fitted with a fixed   second, or back-up bilge pump having an independent and   separate source of power from the pump required in paragraph (a) of this section. One of the bilge pumps may be attached to the propelling   engine.     (c) A portable bilge pump may substitute for the   secondary pump required above, as long as it is:     (1) Self priming and provided with a suitable suction   hose of adequate length to reach the bilges of each   watertight compartment it must serve and is fitted with a   built-in check valve and strainer;     (2) Fitted with a discharge hose of adequate length to   ensure overboard discharge. A portable pump must be capable   of dewatering each space it serves at a rate of at least 2   inches (51 millimeters) of water depth per minute; and     (3) Capable of being quickly and efficiently attached   to the vessel's fixed bilge suction main or discharge piping (such as with ``camlocks'', etc.) for alternate emergency use.     (d) Except where an individual pump is provided for a   separate space or for a portable pump, each individual bilge   suction line must be provided with a stop valve at the   manifold and a check valve at some accessible point in the   bilge line to prevent unintended flooding of a space.     (e) Each bilge suction line and dewatering system must be   fitted with a suitable strainer to prevent clogging of the   suction line. Strainers must have an open area of not less   than three times the open area of the suction line.     (f) Except for a fire pump required by 46 CFR 28.820, a   bilge pump may be used for other purposes.     (g) Each vessel must comply with the oil pollution   prevention requirements of 33 CFR parts 151 and 155.

The preference conferred in 25 U.S.C. 472 must be applied in the filling of every vacant position within the Bureau of Indian Affairs,     Freeman     v.     Morton    , 499 F.2d 492 (DC Cir. 1974). The Secretary issued a final rule for the definition of ``Indian'' on January 17, 1978. A fifth criterion applied to the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma and to the Osage Tribe whose rolls were closed by Acts of Congress and who had not as yet reorganized so as to establish current membership standards. Many such persons have received preference based on the one-quarter degree standard previously established by the Secretary. In order that they would not be deprived of that eligibility and made to meet the one-half degree standard, in 1978, the tribes were allowed 3 years, until July 17, 1981, in which to establish membership standards. Almost 13 years later, the Osage Tribe is the only remaining tribe that has not organized.       The complexities of the Osage's unique history have been described in the litigation surrounding the organization of the tribe and the authority of the Tribal Council. See     Logan     v.     Andrus    , 457 F. Supp. 1318 (D. Okla., 1978),     affirmed     640 F.2d 269 (10th Cir. 1981). It is apparent that the Osages have a uniquely difficult task in organizing, since they are the only tribe which is excluded from organizing under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act and the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. Also, the Secretary's regulations under the 1906 Osage Allotment Act permit only Osage headright holders to vote for the tribal council.   On October 4, 1984, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published a final rule (49 FR 39157) to amend 25 CFR Part 5, Preference in Employment. Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 specified the date of October 4, 1985, as the final date for making appointments of persons of one-quarter degree Indian ancestry. On September 15, 1986, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published a final rule (51 FR 32632) to revise 25 CFR Part 5, Preference in Employment. Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 of this part specified the date of September 15, 1988, as the final date for making appointments of persons of one-quarter degree Indian ancestry. The last final rule published (54 FR 282, January 5, 1989), extended Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 to January 5, 1990. Paragraph (e) of &sect;5.1 has expired and should be removed.   Osage Tribal persons who are employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and who received preference in any previous appointment will continue to be preference eligible so long as they are continuously employed. However, Osage tribal members who are seeking Federal employment must now meet category (c) of &sect;5.1 of this part.                 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Mercedes C.

The proposed rule also would amend parts 53, 71, 92, 94, and 161 of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, to reflect the proposed amendments to part 82. This extension will provide interested persons with additional time in which to prepare comments on the proposed rule.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On June 28, 1994, we published in the     Federal Register     (59 FR 33214&hyph;33233, Docket No. 87&hyph;090&hyph;1) a proposed rule that would revise completely 9 CFR part 82, subpart A, concerning exotic Newcastle disease in birds and poultry, and psittacosis or ornithosis in poultry. The proposed rule would also amend 9 CFR parts 53, 71, 92, 94, and 161 to reflect the proposed amendments to part 82. Comments on the proposed rule were required to be received on or before August 29, 1994.   During the comment period, we received a request from a State Department of Agriculture that we extend the comment period. The commenter stated that additional time was necessary to allow interested parties and agencies within the State to evaluate fully and respond to the proposed rule.   In response to this comment, and so that we may consider comments received after August 29, 1994, we are reopening and extending the public comment period on Docket No. 87&hyph;090&hyph;1 until 60 days after the date of publication of this notice in the     Federal Register    .

text:   SUMMARY:     This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fixed engine cowling at the forward and aft crane beam attachment; and an inspection of the forward and aft crane beam to detect surface damage, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by several reports of rear cabin noise (engine rumble) during flight and while taxiing, which may have been caused by the interference between the forward and aft crane beams and the fasteners in the fixed engine cowling. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent chafing due to normal engine vibration, which could result in structural damage to the engine mount and possible separation of the engine from the airplane.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Comments Invited       Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above.

text:   SUMMARY:     We are prohibiting the importation of Holstein steers and Holstein spayed heifers from Mexico into the United States. The incidence of tuberculosis in these cattle is significantly higher than in other breeds. Since 1991, Holstein steers and Holstein spayed heifers traced back to Mexico have accounted for more than half of the tuberculosis-infected Mexican-origin cattle identified at slaughter in the United States. This action will prevent tuberculosis-exposed Holstein steers and Holstein spayed heifers from Mexico from spreading the disease to U.S. cattle.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background         The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict the importation of certain animals, including cattle from Mexico, to prevent the introduction into the United States of bovine tuberculosis (referred to below as tuberculosis) and other communicable diseases of livestock.     On December 22, 1993, we published in the     Federal Register     (58 FR 67709&hyph;67710, Docket No. 93&hyph;086&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations by prohibiting the importation of Holstein and Holstein cross-bred steers and Holstein and Holstein cross-bred spayed heifers from Mexico into the United States. We proposed this action because of the disproportionately high incidence of tuberculosis in these cattle.     We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending February 22, 1994. We received 7 comments by that date. They were from two dairies, a ranch, a veterinary medical association, a State animal health agency, a dairy industry association, and the Mexican government. Four commenters supported our proposal and one commenter suggested changes to the wording of the proposed amendment. That suggestion, plus the remarks of the two commenters who opposed the proposed rule, are discussed below.         Comment:     The wording of the proposed amendment should be changed so that the amendment prohibits not only Holsteins from Mexico, but any cattle or breeds of cattle normally held in close confinement, such as Holstein dairy cattle, from any country that does not have a tuberculosis control program equivalent to that of the United States, or that has a higher incidence of tuberculosis than the United States. By singling out Mexico, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is leaving the regulation open to being struck down as a ``trade barrier'' under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).         Response:     NAFTA Article 712 requires that all sanitary and phytosanitary measures be based on scientific principles and a risk assessment; our proposed rule was based on data gathered during APHIS' epidemiological investigation of the 1,090 cases of tuberculosis-infected cattle detected at slaughter in the United States during the 18-month period ending March 31, 1993. Consequently, we believe that our prohibition on the importation of certain cattle from Mexico is allowable under NAFTA. Conversely, the wide-ranging and ambiguously worded prohibition suggested by the commenter is not supported by available data and could not be justified under NAFTA. Therefore, we are making no changes in response to this comment.         Comment:     The proposal supports the importation of tuberculosis from Mexico by allowing infected and exposed cattle to be imported from Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's current regulations and the proposed rule defy rational thinking if one is truly concerned about protecting American cattle, wildlife, and humans from tuberculosis imported from Mexico.         Response:     It appears that the commenter is seeking an outright prohibition on the importation of all cattle from Mexico, although he did not offer any justification for such a ban. As we stated in the proposed rule, 713 tuberculosis-infected cattle were identified as being of Mexican origin during the 18-month period ending March 31, 1993; of those infected cattle, 67 percent were identified as Holstein or Holstein cross-bred steers or Holstein or Holstein cross-bred spayed heifers. Based on that information, we proposed to ban the importation of what appears to be the largest single source of tuberculosis-infected cattle among cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. Any actions of the type suggested by the commenter would have to be based on verifiable data and would have to be proposed as part of a separate rulemaking proceeding.         Comment:     In its Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 report on the State-Federal Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program, APHIS stated that epidemiologic investigations involving Mexican steers have shown that approximately 67 percent of the infected imports are of the Holstein breed. APHIS has not, however, produced data indicating a similarly high incidence of tuberculosis in Holstein cross-bred cattle. In the absence of data showing that the incidence of tuberculosis in Holstein cross-bred steers and spayed heifers is at an unacceptably high level, it would not be appropriate to impose further restrictions on their importation.

The incidence of tuberculosis in these cattle is significantly higher than in other breeds. Since 1991, Holstein steers and Holstein spayed heifers traced back to Mexico have accounted for more than half of the tuberculosis-infected Mexican-origin cattle identified at slaughter in the United States. This action will prevent tuberculosis-exposed Holstein steers and Holstein spayed heifers from Mexico from spreading the disease to U.S. cattle.          </SUMMARY> <DATE>  EFFECTIVE DATE:     June 13, 1994.         </DATE>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Dr. Ronald A. Stenseng, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Cattle Diseases and Surveillance Staff, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 729, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8715.         <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background         The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict the importation of certain animals, including cattle from Mexico, to prevent the introduction into the United States of bovine tuberculosis (referred to below as tuberculosis) and other communicable diseases of livestock.     On December 22, 1993, we published in the     Federal Register     (58 FR 67709&hyph;67710, Docket No. 93&hyph;086&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations by prohibiting the importation of Holstein and Holstein cross-bred steers and Holstein and Holstein cross-bred spayed heifers from Mexico into the United States. We proposed this action because of the disproportionately high incidence of tuberculosis in these cattle.     We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending February 22, 1994. We received 7 comments by that date. They were from two dairies, a ranch, a veterinary medical association, a State animal health agency, a dairy industry association, and the Mexican government. Four commenters supported our proposal and one commenter suggested changes to the wording of the proposed amendment. That suggestion, plus the remarks of the two commenters who opposed the proposed rule, are discussed below.         Comment:     The wording of the proposed amendment should be changed so that the amendment prohibits not only Holsteins from Mexico, but any cattle or breeds of cattle normally held in close confinement, such as Holstein dairy cattle, from any country that does not have a tuberculosis control program equivalent to that of the United States, or that has a higher incidence of tuberculosis than the United States. By singling out Mexico, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is leaving the regulation open to being struck down as a ``trade barrier'' under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).         Response:     NAFTA Article 712 requires that all sanitary and phytosanitary measures be based on scientific principles and a risk assessment; our proposed rule was based on data gathered during APHIS' epidemiological investigation of the 1,090 cases of tuberculosis-infected cattle detected at slaughter in the United States during the 18-month period ending March 31, 1993. Consequently, we believe that our prohibition on the importation of certain cattle from Mexico is allowable under NAFTA. Conversely, the wide-ranging and ambiguously worded prohibition suggested by the commenter is not supported by available data and could not be justified under NAFTA. Therefore, we are making no changes in response to this comment.         Comment:     The proposal supports the importation of tuberculosis from Mexico by allowing infected and exposed cattle to be imported from Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's current regulations and the proposed rule defy rational thinking if one is truly concerned about protecting American cattle, wildlife, and humans from tuberculosis imported from Mexico.         Response:     It appears that the commenter is seeking an outright prohibition on the importation of all cattle from Mexico, although he did not offer any justification for such a ban. As we stated in the proposed rule, 713 tuberculosis-infected cattle were identified as being of Mexican origin during the 18-month period ending March 31, 1993; of those infected cattle, 67 percent were identified as Holstein or Holstein cross-bred steers or Holstein or Holstein cross-bred spayed heifers. Based on that information, we proposed to ban the importation of what appears to be the largest single source of tuberculosis-infected cattle among cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. Any actions of the type suggested by the commenter would have to be based on verifiable data and would have to be proposed as part of a separate rulemaking proceeding.         Comment:     In its Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 report on the State-Federal Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program, APHIS stated that epidemiologic investigations involving Mexican steers have shown that approximately 67 percent of the infected imports are of the Holstein breed. APHIS has not, however, produced data indicating a similarly high incidence of tuberculosis in Holstein cross-bred cattle. In the absence of data showing that the incidence of tuberculosis in Holstein cross-bred steers and spayed heifers is at an unacceptably high level, it would not be appropriate to impose further restrictions on their importation.       </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull          Response:     The breed identification information used by APHIS in preparing the FY 1993 report mentioned by the commenter placed Holstein and Holstein cross-bred cattle together in one category. Because such a high percentage of tuberculosis-infected Mexican cattle had been identified as Holstein or Holstein cross-bred cattle, our proposal included both categories. However, animal health officials of the Mexican Government have informed APHIS that Holstein cross-bred cattle are raised under different conditions than Holstein cattle, and thus are much less likely to have a comparable rate of tuberculosis infection. According to those animal health officials, Holstein cross-bred cattle in Mexico are not raised in dairies, as are Holstein cattle, but are usually raised in pastures, often in states where no dairies are located. Given those significant environmental differences, it appears that Holstein cross-bred cattle present less of a risk than had been thought. Additionally, APHIS animal health personnel involved in conducting tracebacks of tuberculosis-infected cattle from Mexico have confirmed that Holstein cross-bred cattle do not appear to present the high level of risk presented by Holstein cattle. Therefore, in response to the comment, we have removed Holstein cross-bred steers and spayed heifers from this final rule.         Comment:     In the proposed rule, APHIS stated that the importation of Holstein and Holstein cross-bred breeding cattle would not be prohibited because the tuberculosis testing required of breeding cattle appears adequate to detect infection in breeding cattle. If the testing procedure is adequate to allow the importation of breeding cattle, it seems that the procedure should also be adequate to allow the importation of steers and spayed heifers.         Response:     The testing requirements for breeding cattle are different from the testing requirements for steers and spayed heifers. Under the regulations in &sect;92.427(c), breeding cattle offered for entry into the United States must be accompanied by a certificate stating that they have been tuberculin tested within the last 3 to 12 months. The breeding cattle are then detained at the port of entry under the supervision of the port veterinarian until tested for tuberculosis with negative results. The testing requirements for steers and spayed heifers, on the other hand, call for only one test, performed either in Mexico no more than 60 days prior to entry, or, if the importer so elects, at the port of entry. Given the large number of steers and spayed heifers imported into the United States_approximately 1 million in an average year_we cannot, as the commenter suggested, apply the same testing requirements to breeding cattle and steers and spayed heifers; APHIS simply does not have the resources to test every steer and spayed heifer offered for entry from Mexico. Consequently, we are making no changes in response to the comment.     Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule with the changes discussed in this document.         Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act         This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.     Of the approximately 1 million Mexican cattle imported from Mexico into the United States during 1991, the most recent year for which complete data are available, we estimate that nearly 12 percent were Holstein steers (in the 1991 data, spayed heifers were counted as steers). During the same year, the U.S. cattle population totaled 99.4 million head. Thus, imported Mexican Holstein steers accounted for less than 1 percent of the total U.S. bovine population.     The total value of imported Mexican Holstein and Holstein cross-bred steers was close to $45 million in 1991, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the 1991 value of the U.S. live cattle inventory, which was estimated at more than $64 billion.     Approximately 48,000 cattle feedlots were operating in the United States during 1991. Of those, 620 feedlots concentrated in western States regularly handle Mexican cattle. Approximately 67 of the feedlots handling Mexican cattle have a capacity of 1,000 head or fewer; such lots can be considered small entities. They account for less than 1 percent of all domestic feedlots. We do not expect this action to significantly affect U.S. importers because they can replace the Holstein steers and Holstein spayed heifers that they may currently import from Mexico with other breeds of feeder cattle.     Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.         Executive Order 12778         This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.         Paperwork Reduction Act         This document contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501     et seq.    ).         List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 92         Animal diseases, Imports, Livestock, Poultry and poultry products, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

We are also adding Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates to the list of countries considered to be affected with African horse sickness (AHS). Outbreaks of CEM, a highly transmissible venereal disease, have been reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro and Serbia). The Member States of the European Union either are affected with CEM or trade horses freely with other Member States that are affected with CEM, without testing the horses for the disease. Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates trade horses freely with other countries where AHS, a fatal viral disease, exists. This action will prohibit or restrict the importation into the United States of horses that have been in these countries. This action is necessary to protect horses in the United States from CEM and AHS. Neither disease is known to exist in the United States.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Background       The regulations concerning the importation of horses (contained in 9 CFR 92.300 through 92.326 and referred to below as the regulations) are designed to protect against the introduction into the United States of various equine diseases such as contagious equine metritis (CEM) and African horse sickness (AHS). Neither CEM, a highly transmissible venereal disease, nor AHS, a fatal viral disease, is known to exist in the United States.       Contagious Equine Metritis       Section 92.301(c)(1) of the regulations prohibits or restricts the importation into the United States of all horses from Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Federal Republic of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Isle of Man) because of the existence of CEM in those countries. This section also prohibits or restricts the importation into the United States of all horses that have been in these countries within the 12 months immediately preceding their export to the United States.   We have received information from the Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro and Serbia) that there have been outbreaks of CEM in these countries. In response, we are amending &sect;92.301(c)(1) to add these countries to the list of countries where CEM exists. We are also adding a note to this section to explain the status of Montenegro and Serbia. The note states that Montenegro and Serbia have asserted the formation of a joint independent State entitled ``The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' but this entity has not been formally recognized as a State by the United States.   Currently, 12 European countries comprise the Member States of the European Union (EU). These countries include Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Federal Republic of Germany, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom are already listed in &sect;92.301(c)(1) as countries where CEM exists.   However, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Spain, which are considered to be free of CEM, trade freely within the EU. The Member States of the EU move horses freely without testing for CEM. Further, many countries that are affected with CEM have applied for membership in the EU. Therefore, horses imported from Member States of the EU that have been considered to be free of CEM present an unacceptable risk that CEM could be introduced into the United States.                       9 CFR Part 92         <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 93&hyph;110&hyph;1] </RINDOCK>      Importation of Horses; Quarantine Requirements      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.        </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Interim rule and request for comments.           </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     We are amending the regulations concerning the importation of horses by adding Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, the Member States of the European Union, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro and Serbia) to the list of countries where contagious equine metritis (CEM) exists.

text: nullnull      Therefore, we are also amending &sect;92.301(c)(1) to include the Member States of the EU in the list of countries where CEM exists. At the same time, we are not removing from the list individual Member States of the EU that are affected with CEM. These steps will ensure that the Member States of the EU that are affected with CEM will remain on the list whether or not they retain their EU membership. Conversely, adding the phrase ``the Member States of the European Union'' will ensure that new countries that join the EU will be covered immediately by these provisions.     Also, we are making two miscellaneous changes to &sect;92.301(c)(1) to facilitate the use of the list of countries where CEM exists. We are alphabetizing the list of countries to make them easier to read. Further, we are changing the entry for ``Czechoslovakia'' to the two Republics now recognized by the United States: ``Czech Republic'' and ``Slovakia.''         African Horse Sickness         Section 92.308(a)(2) of the regulations requires all horses intended for importation from Saudi Arabia, Spain, The Yemen Arab Republic, and all countries on the continent of Africa, including horses that have stopped in or transited those countries, to enter the United States only at the port of New York and be quarantined at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, New York, for at least 60 days because those countries are considered to be affected with AHS.     We have received information that during the Persian-Gulf War, the Governments of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates allowed movement of horses from other countries considered to be affected with AHS, without testing the horses for AHS. Therefore, horses imported into the United States from Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates present an unacceptable risk of introducing AHS into the United States. As a result of this increased disease risk, special efforts are necessary to determine the health of these animals.     To establish the health of horses intended for importation from Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, we are amending &sect;92.308(a)(2) to add these countries to the list of countries considered to be affected with AHS. This means that horses intended for importation from Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates may enter the United States only at the port of New York and must be quarantined at the New York Animal Import Center in Newburgh, New York, for at least 60 days. This 60-day quarantine will provide the necessary time to test or examine horses intended for importation from these countries for AHS and other communicable diseases. Only if the horses test negative and are free from clinical evidence of communicable disease, as certified by the port veterinarian, will horses from Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates be released from quarantine. This action will help ensure that AHS is not introduced into the United States.         Immediate Action         The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the introduction of CEM and AHS into the United States.     Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication in the     Federal Register    . We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the     Federal Register    . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the     Federal Register    . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.         Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act         This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.     For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.     This interim rule will help protect horses in the United States from CEM and AHS. There are probably between 5.2 and 6.6 million horses in the United States. The total value of U.S. horses is about $8 billion ($1,430 each). A very small fraction (between 0.2 and 0.3 percent, based upon 1991 to 1992 figures) of those horses were imported into the United States.     Except for the Member States of the EU, the affected countries export very few horses to the United States. Horses imported into the United States from the Member States of the EU accounted for under 10 percent of the total U.S. horse imports in 1991 and 1992. From 1991 to 1992, the United States imported about 32 horses (less than 0.2 percent of the total U.S. horse imports) from countries whose horses will be prohibited or restricted for the first time.     The horses imported from the affected countries tend to be higher-valued, purebred horses. These horses, worth 10 to 20 times more than the average price per horse from the rest of the world, are likely to continue to be imported despite any additional costs related to quarantine and testing. Quarantine and testing of horses has been estimated at $4,700 for the 60-day AHS quarantine and between $1,200 and $1,500 for the quarantine and testing that is required for CEM.     The U.S. trade in horses is expected to be minimally changed by this rule, since some restrictions already apply to the importation of horses into the United States from most of the affected countries. All but four of the Member States of the EU are already included in the list of countries where CEM exists. Two of those four are affected with AHS and are already subject to restrictions on the importation of their horses into the United States.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts final amendments to the regulations relating to standards of conduct for directors and employees of Farm Credit System (FCS or System) institutions, excluding the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. This action results from a reassessment of the regulations in light of the amendments to the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (1971 Act) made by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (1987 Act) and the findings of a review required by section 514 of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (1992 Act). The final rule updates the regulations to reflect statutory changes and the change in focus of the FCA's regulatory oversight of personnel matters. In addition, the final rule enhances and clarifies the regulations to ensure that they fulfill the purposes of section 514 of the 1992 Act relative to the reporting of financial information and potential conflicts of interest.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On August 19, 1993, the FCA proposed amendments to its regulations relating to standards of conduct for directors and employees of System institutions. See 58 FR 44139. The final regulations retain much of the content of the existing and proposed regulations, but strengthen and clarify them, expanding some of the provisions and relaxing others.           The final regulations also address the concerns and suggestions received on the proposed regulations during the comment period, which expired on September 30, 1993. The FCA received seven comment letters on the proposed regulations during the comment period. Three letters were submitted by System banks, three by System associations, and one by the Farm Credit Council (FCC) on behalf of its member banks and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation. These comments and the FCA responses are summarized below.       In addition to comments received during the comment period, three letters were received concerning the proposed amendments that have also been considered by the FCA Board. Two comment letters pertaining to the proposed standards-of-conduct regulations were received pursuant to the FCA's request for comments on regulatory burden, published in the     Federal Register     on June 23, 1993. See 58 FR 34003. These comments related to reporting requirements and are similar to the comments received during the comment period for the proposed regulations. They are summarized and addressed in the Board's response to comments relating to reporting that were received during the comment period for the proposed regulations. One letter was received from an association as a followup to a meeting held in Dallas, Texas, between FCA's Board and senior management and directors and officers of FCS associations. The association expressed a concern regarding the ability to attract and retain qualified directors if they are prohibited from purchasing acquired property as proposed. The FCA received numerous comments on this prohibition and the Board's response appears later in the preamble.           General Comments         Two comments were received concerning the effective date of the amendments. The FCC urged the FCA to allow sufficient lead time between publication of the final regulations and the effective date to permit boards of directors the opportunity to consider carefully the many policy judgments that are left to their discretion by the regulations. Another comment recommended an effective date no earlier than January 1, 1995, suggesting that existing regulations and policies would continue to provide adequate direction and control in the interim.       The Board agrees that there should be sufficient lead time to revise policies, especially in view of changes made in the final regulations in response to comments. Although the final regulations are substantially changed from the proposed regulations in response to the comments, the Board believes that with the delayed effective date the public will have ample opportunity to further review the regulations and bring any observations to the Board's attention prior to the effective date of the regulations. As always, the Board will consider requests for further clarification of or amendments to the regulations prior to or after their effective date. Consequently, the Board adopts final regulations with a delayed effective date not earlier than December 31, 1994.                               12 CFR Part 612           <RINDOCK>RIN 3052&hyph;AB47 </RINDOCK>        Personnel Administration        <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Farm Credit Administration.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.             </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts final amendments to the regulations relating to standards of conduct for directors and employees of Farm Credit System (FCS or System) institutions, excluding the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.

text: nullnull      One commenter stated that the proposed regulations would result in a regulatory burden and that while some improvement in clarity and flexibility is offered, the benefits do not appear commensurate with the time and cost of implementing the changes. The commenter also stated that conflicts of interest have not been improperly or inadequately handled and that there is no reason to believe the proposed changes will provide any significant improvement in avoiding, handling, or reporting conflict-of-interest situations where an institution has been complying with the present regulations. According to the commenter, the proposed regulations would require substantial effort to revamp policies and procedures.       The FCA Board has not undertaken this revision of the standards-of-conduct regulations because of improper or inadequate handling or reporting of conflicts of interest. Rather, as noted earlier, the revision is intended to update the regulations to reflect statutory changes and a change in the focus of the FCA's regulatory oversight of personnel matters, as well as to respond to section 514 of the 1992 Act. While the FCA recognizes that the revamping of policies and procedures requires substantial effort, the final regulations attempt to minimize any burden by providing a delayed effective date. Also, the FCA has adjusted the proposed regulations in response to comments where it was possible to achieve its objectives by less burdensome means. The final regulations place more responsibility on the institutions and their officers and directors for identifying possible sources of conflict and developing adequate controls, but also offer more flexibility for developing procedures that effectively address significant conflicts without imposing burdensome requirements that are ineffective in preventing conflicts of interest. While this will initially require more work, the FCA believes that it is a more effective approach to conflicts of interest and that it more appropriately reflects the focus of the responsibility for preventing conflicts of interest and the role of the FCA as regulator.       Another commenter supported four of the primary FCA policy objectives, namely: (1) Enhancing each association's accountability for sound standards-of-conduct programs; (2) maintaining high standards of conduct to ensure the proper performance of System business; (3) holding directors and employees to the same standard where the potential for conflict is the same; and (4) establishing that the internal corporate matters of devotion of time to official duties, political activity, nepotism, exchange of gifts, and improper use of official property are best left to each institution's board of directors to oversee through the implementation of a standards-of-conduct policy. However, the commenter disagreed with the proposed strict prohibition of a director purchasing property acquired by the institution through foreclosure. The Board's response to this comment is addressed in detail later in the preamble.           Section-by-Section Analysis of Comments Received           The following narrative summarizes the comments received on the various sections of the regulations during the comment period, in response to the Regulatory Burden Notice, and as a followup to the Dallas meeting, and provides the Board's response to those comments.           Section 612.2130_Definitions           While no comments were received regarding the proposed changes to this section, the FCC provided comments on the definitions in the existing regulations for ``controlled entity'' and ``officer'' and requested the FCA to define the terms ``financially obligated'' and ``business proprietor'' to clarify how the prohibitions in proposed &sect;&sect;612.2140(g) and 612.2150(h) are intended to interface.       The FCC recommended changing the definition of ``controlled entity'' to one similar to that used in the attribution rules of the lending limit regulations. See 12 CFR 614.4358(a)(3). Specifically, this would increase the 5-percent threshold for control in existing regulations to a 50-percent threshold. The FCC believes that 5-percent ownership is a very stringent and perhaps unrealistic test of control, and that the term ``controlling influence,'' without a higher threshold is perhaps too vague to be meaningful.       The Board does not believe that the definition of control in the lending limit regulations is an appropriate definition for standards-of-conduct regulations. The purpose of the definition of control in the lending limit regulations is to identify when borrowers are so related that they should be regarded as a single credit risk. The purpose of the definition of control in the standards-of- conduct regulations is to identify when an interest is so significant that if an individual were to act on a matter concerning the related party, there would be an appearance of a conflict of interest. Consequently, the FCA believes that the control threshold for standards of conduct should be much lower than the control threshold for the purposes of lending limits. Control thresholds used in regulations directed at conflicts of interest are typically much lower. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires disclosure of certain transactions with the institution of individuals owning 5 percent or more of a class of the institution's stock. The Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision have similar requirements for institutions they regulate that are public companies required to register under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Comptroller imposes similar disclosure requirements on all national banks when they sell their securities, whether or not they are public companies. The phrase ``exercises a controlling influence'' is intended as a catch-all to capture those situations in which a person does not meet the objective control tests, but for some other reason has the power to control the management of the entity's policies. This term is a common component of control definitions and has long been a component of the part 612 definition of control without causing a particular problem. The definition is used to determine when a director or officer must recuse him or herself and in the reporting provisions, both of which are direct responsibilities of directors and employees. Such persons are likely to know when they are in a position to control management of the entity's policies, and, if in doubt, should err on the side of recusal and reporting. For the reasons stated above, no change has been made to the definition of ``controlled entity.''

text: nullnull      The FCC suggested that the position of chief executive officer be added to the definition of ``officer'' since a number of System institutions have both a president and a chief executive officer, or a chief executive officer rather than a president. The Board adopts this suggestion and also adds specific references to chief operating officers, chief financial officers, and chief credit officers.   On a related issue, the FCC questioned whether an association's contracting with its supervising bank for a Standards of Conduct Officer would violate the joint employee provisions of &sect;612.2157. To clarify that it would not, unless the person otherwise satisfies the definition in &sect;612.2130(m), the term ``Standards of Conduct Officer'' is changed to the ``Standards of Conduct Official'' in the final regulations.       The FCC recommended that the term ``financially obligated'' be defined, and that prohibited ``financially obligated'' transactions be more clearly distinguished from business relationships that are permissible.   The final regulations define ``financially obligated with'' to mean having a joint legally enforceable obligation with, being financially obligated on behalf of (contingently or otherwise), having an enforceable legal obligation secured by a property owned by another, or owning property that secures an enforceable legal obligation of another. The Board's revision to &sect;&sect;612.2140(g) and 612.2150(h) responds to the request to distinguish permissible business relationships from prohibited ``financially obligated with'' relationships and is discussed below under those sections.   As a result of this revision, the term ``business proprietor'' is no longer used in the regulations and its definition has been deleted. In addition, to avoid any possible confusion relative to reporting requirements, the definition for the term ``business relationship'' or ``transacts business'' has been deleted in the final rule.   The definition of ``ordinary course of business'' in the final regulations has been added as described in the discussion of &sect;612.2140.   The definition of ``family'' has been clarified to spell out more specifically those persons included under the phrase ``and each person having such relationships by marriage.''       Section 612.2135_Director and Employee Responsibilities and   Conduct_Generally       No comments were received on this section and it is adopted as proposed.       Section 612.2140_Directors_Prohibited Conduct       The Board proposed to adopt some of the specific prohibitions applicable to employees and specifically requested comments on whether these prohibitions would operate too restrictively on directors. A number of comments were received. The majority of commenters opposed the proposed prohibition in paragraph (f) of this section concerning a director's purchasing property owned by the director's institution or an institution it supervises or is supervised by during the preceding 12 months when such property was acquired through foreclosure or similar action. The FCC asserted that a strict prohibition would make it more difficult to attract or retain qualified directors and suggested that such purchases be permitted on an institution-by-institution basis depending on whether the institution has adequate controls in place to ensure that directors do not receive an advantage or favoritism over other prospective purchasers. Other commenters suggested that there are less restrictive alternatives available to avoid real or apparent conflicts of interest and ensure continued public confidence in the System. One alternative offered was a general prohibition on acquired property purchases by directors except by public auction or open competitive bidding. The commenters also disagreed that the potential for conflicts of interest is as great for directors as it is for employees.   After additional consideration of the issues in light of the public comments, the Board has concluded that a total prohibition of director purchases of acquired property may be overly restrictive. Directors of Farm Credit Banks, associations, and certain directors of agricultural credit banks, except outside directors, are required to be farmers, ranchers, or producers or harvesters of aquatic products, and as such may want to acquire additional land that becomes available in their communities. Restrictions on their ability to acquire land that becomes available for sale from the institution while they are serving as director could be a serious disincentive for a successful individual to serve as a director. On the other hand, the potential for conflict is especially serious where there is strong motivation for acquiring property owned by the institution. Therefore, it is important that there be adequate controls in place to ensure that the director's impartiality is not impaired and that the director does not use his or her position to gain some advantage in acquiring property. The final regulations do not prohibit such acquisitions, but require that the property be purchased at public auctions or in open competitive bidding. In addition, to avoid the appearance of conflict, it is important that a director interested in acquiring such property not participate in deliberations or decisions concerning foreclosure or disposition of that property. Therefore, the final regulations prohibit a director from acquiring such property, even through public auction or competitive bidding, if he or she has participated in the decision to foreclose or dispose of the property or in establishing the terms of the sale.

text: nullnull      The FCC recommended that there be an additional exception in paragraph (g) of this section under which an otherwise prohibited transaction would be permissible if approved by the Standards of Conduct Official. Paragraph (g) of the proposed regulations prohibited lending transactions between directors and other directors, employees or borrowers, but excepts loans between family members, loans made in an official capacity, and transactions in the ordinary course of business, as defined. The commenter recommended that the suggested approval be based upon a determination that the transaction does not present any significant risk of impairing the director's (or employee's) ability to perform his or her duties with impartiality and in compliance with regulations.   After considering the comment and the likelihood that the institutions themselves are in the best position to know what is in the ordinary course of business in the local business environment, the Board concluded that the suggestion had merit as a substitution for the ordinary course of business exception. However, the Board believes that there should be a regulatory standard against which such determinations can be evaluated that will provide a measure of uniformity among FCS institutions. The Board concluded that some relief from the prohibition is appropriate when the transaction is so insignificant in amount as not to create the appearance of a conflict in the eyes of a reasonable person or is an ordinary course of business transaction that is not on preferential terms.   Therefore, in the final regulations the proposed ordinary course of business exception has been replaced by a provision that essentially allows the Standards of Conduct Officer to grant a waiver where: (1) The amount of the transaction is so immaterial that it would not cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the impartiality or objectivity of the director in performing his or her official duties; or (2) where the transaction is in the ordinary course of business; provided the director recuses him or herself from any matter affecting the financial interest of the other party to the transaction. ``Ordinary course of business'' is defined to mean a transaction with a person who is in the business of offering the goods or services that are the subject of the transaction on terms that are not preferential or a transaction between two persons who are in business together that is incident to the business they conduct together. A ``preferential'' transaction is one that is not on the same terms as those available for comparable transactions with other persons who are not officers and directors of System institutions. The Standard of Conduct Official's determination that either of the circumstances warranting an exception exists must be documented and is subject to the recordkeeping requirements, unless the transaction falls within any materiality thresholds for various types of transactions or specific ordinary course of business guidelines established by the Board's standards-of-conduct policy. While not applicable, the Uniform Standards of Ethical Conduct for Executive Branch Employees may be useful as a resource in determining such policy guidelines.   The Board believes that this change responds to the FCC's concern that a deferral of payment may be construed as a loan and the concern that the exclusion in the proposed regulation may fail to reach transactions between an elected director (or employee) who is a borrower and an institution's outside director.   The FCC recommended that the FCA explain its rationale for prohibiting employees from being financially obligated with directors, other employees, and borrowers, but having no similar prohibition for directors.

text: nullnull      The FCA believes there is a greater potential for conflict for employees in having these types of relationships with borrowers because employees are in a position to have a more direct influence on the institution's dealings with the borrower. Also, since directors (except outside directors) are statutorily required to be borrower/stockholders, such a restriction could constitute an inappropriate restraint on the ability of directors to pursue their primary occupation. However, in light of the greater flexibility granted in the final regulation to define an exception to the prohibition on lending transactions, the Board believes that the institution can make appropriate distinctions in its policies to reflect the greater potential for conflict among employees and the impact of the prohibition on the ability of the director to pursue his or her primary occupation. Therefore, the final regulations make the prohibition for directors congruent with the employee prohibition by including ``financially obligated with'' transactions within the scope of the prohibition. See &sect;612.2150 for discussion of the comments on this prohibition for employees. In addition, the final regulation expands the family loan transaction exception to include any person residing in the director's household and relies on recusal to prevent conflicts of interest. Accordingly, the recusal provision in &sect;612.2140(a) is expanded to include any person residing in the director's household and to include a specific reference to business partners.       Section 612.2145_Director Reporting         The FCC believes the requirement to disclose the name of any relative or entity controlled by a relative that transacts business with the institution or an institution supervised by the institution is overly broad. The FCC suggested that the definition of ``relative,'' for purposes of disclosure under &sect;&sect;612.2145(b)(1) and 612.2155(b)(1), be limited to immediate family members as defined in part 620 of this chapter. Section 620.1(e) of this chapter defines ``immediate family member'' to mean spouse, parents, siblings, children, mothers- and fathers-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law, and sons- and daughters-in-law. In addition, the FCC commented that it is extremely difficult for a director to disclose a list of borrowers with whom the director or the director's entity transacts business, since if the director is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business, he or she will have little or no knowledge of the people who conduct business with the director's entity. Also, a director may not know that the individual or entity is a borrower. The FCC assumed that this was not the intention of &sect;612.2145 and that the requirement to disclose ``to the best of his or her knowledge after reasonable inquiry'' was designed to address this problem. However, the FCC recommended that the requirement of ``reasonable inquiry'' be deleted, noting that it is difficult to know what reasonable inquiry is in any particular case. The FCC also suggested that directors be required to disclose only those business relationships with borrowers that are other than ordinary course of business relationships, unusually large transactions, ongoing contractual relationships, or transactions with nonstandard terms and conditions, or terms other than those arrived at through arm's-length negotiations. The FCC argued that any appearance of conflict would be eliminated by the knowledge that neither the director nor the borrower received special terms. The FCC also recommended that each institution be allowed the opportunity to define transactions other than in the ordinary course of business within the above parameters. The FCC also commented that it is difficult to understand how a director's position can be compromised by the mere fact that a borrower does business with the director or an entity owned by the director.   Some of the FCC's comments appear to reflect a misunderstanding of the requirements of both proposed and existing regulations. Neither the proposed regulations nor existing regulations require the reporting of transactions with borrowers. The proposed regulations merely require the disclosure of the name of any relative or any entity in which the director has a financial interest if the relative or entity transacts business with borrowers. Transacting business with borrowers is the standard that narrows the class of persons or entities a director must report. An institution could, for instance, require instead the reporting of the names of all entities in which a director or employee has a financial interest, irrespective of whether such entities transact business with borrowers. Such a requirement would require more reporting, but might be easier for the individuals required to report. The regulatory requirement is a minimum requirement. The FCA encourages boards to require sufficient reporting to permit adequate monitoring of potential conflicts.   After considering the comments on the reporting requirements, the final regulations have been modified in several ways in response to revisions to the prohibited conduct sections and in an effort to ease any unnecessary burden the proposed regulations might have entailed. The final regulations permit the institution greater flexibility to determine the applicability of the prohibition on lending transactions among directors, employees, and borrowers and relies more heavily on recusal as a means of resolving conflicts of interest than the existing regulations or the proposed regulations. Since the FCA believes that the reporting requirements should provide the institution sufficient information for the institution to determine when recusal rather than prohibition is appropriate, an effort has been made to make the reporting requirements parallel the recusal provisions.

text: nullnull      The final regulations do not narrow the definition of ``relative'' as suggested. To do so would narrow the scope of the exception from the lending and borrowing prohibition and the reach of the recusal provision. The suggested narrowing would have deleted ``aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and grandchildren,'' and these relationships are often close enough that it would be unreasonable to restrict borrowing and lending between family members when such family members are borrowers. Similarly, these relationships are often close enough that it is not unreasonable to require recusal from matters affecting their interests. However, the standard for reporting the names of relatives in the final regulations is whether the individual ``knows or has reason to know'' that a relative or entity transacts business with the institution or a supervised institution or a borrower of such institutions. The ``knows or has reason to know'' standard is adopted to address concerns that ``to the best of his or her knowledge after reasonable inquiry'' imposes a duty to inquire, the reasonableness of which could lead to disputes. The ``knows or has reason to know'' standard is a common legal standard that is used to ensure that a person's assertion about the state of his or her knowledge can be challenged in circumstances in which any reasonable person would be deemed to have knowledge. The ``actual knowledge'' standard suggested by the FCC is not adopted because it does not allow any basis for the FCA to question a director's assertion regarding his or her subjective state of mind even in the most obvious circumstances.   The reporting requirements supporting the disclosure requirements of part 620 of this chapter have been more narrowly focused in the final regulations on information needed by the institution to make appropriate disclosures under part 620 of this chapter, and more clearly specify the information required to be reported. In addition, the final regulations also permit greater flexibility in determining the frequency of reporting for matters required to be reported, other than matters that are required to be reported for part 620 of this chapter.   The FCC also recommended that the reporting requirement for a director or employee who becomes or plans to become involved in any relationship, transaction, or activity that is required to be reported or could constitute a conflict of interest be expanded to require the Standards of Conduct Official to determine whether such involvement is, in fact, a conflict of interest. The Board has adopted the FCC's suggestion in the final regulations and has also added a requirement that the determination specify what controls, such as recusal, are necessary to ensure that the appearance of conflict is minimized.   A commenter noted that the proposed requirement that all new directors report all matters listed in the director reporting section within 1 month after election or appointment perpetuates the present reporting redundancy involving a director candidate's disclosure. In response to this concern, the final regulations require reporting only if no disclosure was made as a director candidate under part 620 of this chapter within the preceding 180 days, as this would be considered sufficient disclosure.       Section 612.2150_Employees_Prohibited Conduct       Comments were received from the FCC regarding the prohibition against employees borrowing from, lending to, or becoming financially obligated with or on behalf of a director, employee, or agent of the employing, supervising, or a supervised institution or a borrower or loan applicant of the employing institution. The FCA also considered the appropriateness of the FCC's comments on the parallel director prohibition for the employee prohibition. The FCC recommended that there be an additional exception under which an otherwise prohibited transaction would be permissible if approved by the Standards of Conduct Official after a determination that the transaction does not present any significant risk of impairing the director's or employee's ability to perform his or her duties with impartiality and in compliance with the regulations.   The FCA concluded that the same modification that was made to &sect;612.2140(g) should be made to the employee prohibition. See discussion above.

In addition, one commenter observed that such a relaxation would be inconsistent with the functional independence required by FCA appraisal regulations. Another commenter asserted that the phrase ``for the employee's own account'' is unclear and suggested substituting ``intended for the employee's own or immediate family use.''   In view of the commenters' concerns and assurance that the prohibition is not a particularly burdensome requirement for staff appraisers, the FCA has decided not to adopt the appraiser exception at this time. In addition, the final regulations substitute ``intended for the use of the employee, a member of the employee's family, or a person residing in the employee's household'' for ``for the employee's own account,'' to clarify that the latter term was not intended to permit an employee to act as an agent or broker for commercial purposes.       Section 612.2155_Employee Reporting       The FCC commented that the scope and frequency of reports required by &sect;612.2155 are unwarranted, unduly burdensome, and unduly costly below the senior officer level. The FCC recommended that the FCA distinguish between senior officers and other employees in the reporting requirements. The FCC stated that, in its judgment, reports by non-senior officers when hired and biennially thereafter are fully adequate, especially since employees are required to report covered activities as they occur in the interim. They also recommended that the FCA remove the specific reporting requirements and require institutions to establish reporting procedures to ensure that relationships and activities subject to the regulations are properly disclosed and acted upon.   The FCC commented on proposed paragraph (b)(1) of this section, which requires employees to file an annual statement disclosing the name of any relative or entity controlled by relatives that transact business with the institution or any institution supervised by the institution. The concern raised was that the disclosure is to be based not only on actual knowledge, but also upon reasonable inquiry. This was considered to be unreasonably broad in view of the definition of ``relative,'' because many such relatives may be virtual strangers to the employee in question and it is difficult to know what reasonable inquiry is in any particular case. The FCC also suggested that ``relative'' for purposes of disclosure be limited to immediate family members, as defined in &sect;620.1(e) of this chapter.   The same modifications that were made to the director reporting sections have been made to the employee reporting sections in the final regulations. Part 620 reporting requirements are focused on matters not already within the institution's knowledge and specifically restricted to employees who are subject to disclosure requirements, namely senior officers, as defined in part 620 of this chapter. The final regulations allow the institution to determine employee reporting frequency for matters not required for part 620 disclosures, but the institution must establish reporting requirements sufficient to permit the effective enforcement of the regulations and the standards-of-conduct policy. This will allow institutions to exclude certain individuals or classes of individuals from the reporting requirement based on the functions the employee performs. For instance, positions where there is a substantial degree of supervision and a low level of responsibility may make the reporting requirement unnecessary.   The FCC commented that it appears &sect;612.2150(d) prohibits an employee from serving as a director of an entity that transacts business with the employing or supervised institution, while &sect;612.2155(b)(2) requires an employee to report the name and nature of any entity in which the employee has a financial interest or on whose board the employee sits, if the entity transacts business with the employing institution. The final regulations delete the reference to entities on whose board the employee serves in the reporting requirement.

text: nullnull      In response to an FCC recommendation on director reporting requirements, &sect;612.2155 is expanded to require the Standards of Conduct Official to determine whether any reported transaction or activity is, in fact, a conflict of interest and what controls are necessary to ensure that there is no appearance of a conflict of interest.   A commenter noted that for new employee reporting requirements it is unclear whether 1 month refers to the time an employment offer is extended and accepted or 1 month after the employee commences work. The final regulations have been revised to make it clear that a newly hired employee must report the required matters within 30 days after accepting an offer for employment. However, under the final regulations, the institution may establish a reasonable period for such new employees to terminate such transactions, activities, or relationships not to exceed the period provided for existing employees to terminate conduct prohibited under the institution's policies.   The FCA believes that these changes, together with the greater flexibility in defining exceptions to prohibited lending and borrowing relationships, will enable institutions to fashion standards-of-conduct programs that are more focused on areas in which the potential for conflict is most significant without imposing ineffective, burdensome, and costly reporting requirements.   Although enhancing the disclosure of financial information and reporting of conflicts of interest was the purpose of section 514 of the 1992 Act, the experience of the FCA in implementing Uniform Standards of Ethical Conduct for Executive Branch Employees is that training employees to recognize situations that present conflicts of interest is also an effective use of resources to prevent conflicts of interest. The FCA strongly encourages each System institution to conduct effective periodic training programs to ensure that employees are informed of the requirements of the regulations and the institution's policies and are sensitive to circumstances that give the appearance of a conflict of interest. Although the FCA believes that the responsibility to avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest rests primarily with the individual director or employee, the institution has a responsibility to develop policies and procedures that monitor compliance with the regulation and avoid the appearance of conflict. Providing guidance and training concerning appropriate and inappropriate behavior is an effective way of achieving that end.       Section 612.2157_Joint Employees       The FCC questioned the advisability of having the supervising bank's Standards of Conduct Officer contract with an association in the district to comply with these requirements on behalf of the association and be accountable to the association's board. The FCC stated that it is not clear whether this arrangement is possible since the Standards of Conduct Officer is an officer of the bank as defined in &sect;612.2130(m).   The Standards of Conduct Officer does not come within the definition of ``officer'' in &sect;612.2130(m), unless the individual designated to perform the duties of the Standards of Conduct Officer satisfies the definition because of other duties. Therefore, for clarity, the position is referred to in the final regulations as the ``Standards of Conduct Official'' rather than ``Standard of Conduct Officer,'' but in no way is this action intended to diminish the importance of the position. In addition, the final regulations do not require an association to contract with the bank's Standards of Conduct Official. An association may contract with the bank for these services to be performed by an individual whom the bank has designated as the bank's Standards of Conduct Official. The final regulations also include reference to an agricultural credit bank in addition to a Farm Credit Bank to provide for the situation in which an association is supervised by such a bank.       Section 612.2160_Institution Responsibilities       No comments were received on this new section and it is adopted as proposed.       Section 612.2165_Policies and Procedures       The FCC suggested that the regulations require an institution to provide a reasonable period of time for new directors and new employees to terminate transactions, relationships, and activities that are prohibited by the regulations and the institution's standards-of-conduct policies. The Board agrees with this suggestion and adds a new paragraph (b)(9) requiring a System institution to provide a reasonable period of time for new directors and new employees to terminate transactions, relationships, and activities that are prohibited. The purpose of this revision is to clarify that a new director or employee involved in a prohibited transaction prior to election or hiring is not prohibited from accepting the position. However, such persons are required to terminate any transactions subject to prohibitions within such time period as established by institution policy, beginning with the commencement of official duties, except that such period may not exceed the period established for existing directors and employees to terminate transactions, relationships, or activities prohibited by the institution's policies.       Section 612.2170_Standards of Conduct Official       In addition to changing ``Officer'' to ``Official,'' as discussed above, the final regulations add a requirement that records be maintained for all determinations made by the Standards of Conduct Official and for resolution of each case reported pursuant to this part. Also, the office within the FCA designated to receive reports under part 612 is changed to the Office of General Counsel, which also receives reports relative to part 617 of this chapter.

The Board concurs that the potential for conflict in a director's or employee's purchase of System obligations that are available for purchase by the general public through members of the selling group or in the secondary market is small. Therefore, the final regulations permit such purchases under the conditions listed in &sect;612.2270.

(a) Directors and employees of all System institutions shall maintain high standards of industry, honesty, integrity, impartiality, and conduct in order to ensure the proper performance of System business and continued public confidence in the System and each of its institutions.

The Corporation official(s) designated by the Chairman of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation are authorized to perform all duties which the Chairman is authorized to perform under these regulations, the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, and the joint regulations issued under that Act.         &sect;1408.5     Responsibility for collection.         (a) The collection of claims shall be aggressively pursued in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, the joint regulations issued under that Act, and these regulations. Debts owed to the United States, together with charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs, should be collected in one lump sum unless otherwise provided by law. If a debtor requests installment payments, the debtor, as requested by the Corporation, shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the debtor is unable to pay the debt in one lump sum. When appropriate, the Corporation shall arrange an installment payment schedule. Claims which cannot be collected directly or by administrative offset shall be either written off as administratively uncollectible or referred to the General Counsel for further consideration.     (b) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may compromise claims for money or property arising out of the activities of the Corporation, where the claim (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs) does not exceed $100,000. When the claim exceeds $100,000 (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs), the authority to accept a compromise rests solely with the Department of Justice. The standards governing the compromise of claims are set forth in 4 CFR part 103.     (c) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may suspend or terminate the collection of claims which do not exceed $100,000 (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs) after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections. If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, a claim exceeds $100,000 (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs), the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the Department of Justice. The standards governing the suspension or termination of claim collections are set forth in 4 CFR part 104.     (d) The Corporation shall refer claims to the Department of Justice for litigation or to the General Accounting Office (GAO) for claims arising from audit exceptions taken by the GAO to payments made by the Corporation in accordance with 4 CFR part 105.         &sect;1408.6     Demand for payment.         (a) A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals should normally be made upon a debtor, unless a response or other information indicates that additional written demands would either be unnecessary or futile. When necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demands may be preceded by other appropriate actions under Federal law, including immediate referral for litigation and/or administrative offset.     (b) The initial demand for payment shall be in writing and shall inform the debtor of the following:     (1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, and the facts upon which the determination of indebtedness was made;     (2) The payment due date, which shall be 30 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand for payment;

The debtor shall be informed that the acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the agency;     (6) That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if payment is not received by the payment due date;     (7) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the Corporation to pay the debt, has not requested the Corporation to review the debt, or has not paid the debt by the payment due date, the Corporation intends to collect the debt by all legally available means, which may include initiating legal action against the debtor, referring the debt to a collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by offset, or asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset;    (8) The name and address of the Corporation official to whom the debtor shall send all correspondence relating to the debt; and     (9) Other information, as may be appropriate.     (c) If, prior to, during, or after completion of the demand cycle, the Corporation determines to collect the debt by either administrative or salary offset, the Corporation shall follow, as applicable, the requirements for a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset or a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset set forth in &sect;1408.22.     (d) If no response to the initial demand for payment is received by the payment due date, the Corporation shall take further action under this part, under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, under the joint regulations (4 CFR parts 101&hyph;105), or under any other applicable State or Federal law. These actions may include reports to credit bureaus, referrals to collection agencies, termination of contracts, debarment, and salary or administrative offset.         &sect;1408.7     Right to inspect and copy records.         The debtor may inspect and copy the Corporation records related to the claim. The debtor shall give the Corporation reasonable advanced notice that he/she intends to inspect and copy the records involved. The debtor shall pay copying costs unless they are waived by the Corporation. Copying costs shall be assessed pursuant to &sect;1402.22 of this chapter.         &sect;1408.8     Right to offer to repay claim.         (a) The debtor may offer to enter into a written agreement with the Corporation to repay the amount of the claim. The acceptance of such an offer and the decision to enter into such a written agreement is at the discretion of the Corporation.     (b) If the debtor requests a repayment arrangement because payment of the amount due would create a financial hardship, the Corporation shall analyze the debtor's financial condition. The Corporation may enter into a written agreement with the debtor permitting the debtor to repay the debt in installments if the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that payment of the amount due would create an undue financial hardship for the debtor. The written agreement shall set forth the amount and frequency of installment payments and shall, in accordance with &sect;1408.12, provide for the imposition of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs unless waived by the Corporation.     (c) The written agreement may require the debtor to execute a confess-judgment note when the total amount of the deferred installments will exceed $750. The Corporation shall provide the debtor with a written explanation of the consequences of signing a confess-judgment note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the written explanation. The statement shall recite that the written explanation was read and understood before execution of the note and that the debtor signed the note knowingly and voluntarily. Documentation of these procedures will be maintained in the Corporation's file on the debtor.         &sect;1408.9     Right to agency review.         (a) If the debtor disputes the claim, the debtor may request a review of the Corporation's determination of the existence of the debt or of the amount of the debt. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion should be paid by the payment due date.     (b) To obtain a review, the debtor shall submit a written request for review to the Corporation official named in the initial demand letter, within 15 calendar days after receipt of the letter. The debtor's request for review shall state the basis on which the claim is disputed.     (c) The Corporation shall promptly notify the debtor, in writing, that the Corporation has received the request for review. The Corporation shall conduct its review of the claim in accordance with &sect;1408.10.     (d) Upon completion of its review of the claim, the Corporation shall notify the debtor whether the Corporation's determination of the existence or amount of the debt has been sustained, amended, or canceled. The notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official pursuant to &sect;1408.10(e). If the Corporation's determination is sustained, this notification shall contain a provision which states that the Corporation intends to collect the debt by all legally available means, which may include initiating legal action against the debtor, referring the debt to a collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by offset, or asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset.         &sect;1408.10     Review procedures.         (a) Unless an oral hearing is required by &sect;1408.23(d), the Corporation's review shall be a review of the written record of the claim.     (b) If an oral hearing is required under &sect;1408.23(d) the Corporation shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for such a hearing. The oral hearing, however, shall not be an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of a formal evidentiary hearing. All significant matters discussed at the hearing, however, will be carefully documented.     (c) Any review required by this part, whether a review of the written record or an oral hearing, shall be conducted by a hearing official. In the case of a salary offset, the hearing official shall not be under the supervision or control of the Chairman of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation.

The debtor may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of the debtor's choice and at the debtor's expense.  (e) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision based on documentary evidence and, if applicable, information developed at an oral hearing. The written decision shall be issued as soon as practicable after the review but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request for review was received by the Corporation, unless the debtor requests a delay in the proceedings. A delay in the proceedings shall be granted if the hearing official determines, in his or her sole discretion, that there is good cause to grant the delay. If a delay is granted, the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the review was postponed.  (f) Upon issuance of the written opinion, the Corporation shall promptly notify the debtor of the hearing official's decision. Said notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.      &sect;1408.11     Special review.      (a) An employee subject to salary offset, under subpart C of this part, or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a special review by the Corporation of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.  (b) To determine whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:  (1) Income from all sources;  (2) Assets;  (3) Liabilities;  (4) Number of dependents;  (5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;  (6) Medical expenses; and  (7) Exceptional expenses, if any.  (c) If the employee requests a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee.  (d) The Corporation shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes an undue financial hardship on the employee. The Corporation shall notify the employee in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule.        &sect;1408.12     Charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties.        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Corporation shall:    (1) Assess interest on unpaid claims;    (2) Assess administrative costs incurred in processing and handling overdue claims; and    (3) Assess penalty charges not to exceed 6 percent a year on any part of a debt more than 90 days past due.    The imposition of charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties shall be made in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.    (b)(1) Interest shall accrue from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand for payment or the Notice of Intent to Collect by either Administrative or Salary Offset if the amount of the claim is not paid within 30 days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand or notice.    (2) The 30-day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis if the Corporation reasonably determines that such action is appropriate. Interest shall only accrue on the principal of the claim and the interest rate shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in cases where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, or if the Corporation reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of the United States.    (c) If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, the Corporation may assess a new interest rate on the unpaid claim. In addition, charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties which accrued but were not collected under the original repayment agreement shall be added to the principal of the claim to be paid under the new repayment agreement. Interest shall accrue on the entire principal balance of the claim, as adjusted to reflect any increase resulting from the addition of these charges.    (d) The Corporation may waive charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or penalties if it determines that: (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the claim within a reasonable period of time;    (2) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or penalties would jeopardize collection of the principal of the claim;    (3) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, or penalties would be against equity and good conscience; or

The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may contract for collection services in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718 and 4 CFR 102.6 to recover debts.        &sect;1408.14     Reporting of credit information.        The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may disclose to a consumer reporting agency information that an individual is responsible for a debt owed to the United States. Information will be disclosed to reporting agencies in accordance with the terms and conditions of agreements entered into between the Corporation and the reporting agencies. The terms and conditions of such agreements shall specify that all of the rights and protection afforded to the debtor under 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) have been fulfilled. The Corporation shall notify each consumer reporting agency, to which a claim was disclosed, when the debt has been satisfied.        &sect;1408.15     Credit report.        In order to aid the Corporation in making appropriate determinations regarding the collection and compromise of claims; the collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties; the use of administrative offset; the use of other collection methods; and the likelihood of collecting the claim, the Corporation may institute, consistent with the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681, et seq.), a credit investigation of the debtor immediately following a determination that the claim exists.        Subpart B_Administrative Offset        &sect;1408.20     Applicability.        (a) The provisions of this subpart shall apply to the collection of debts by administrative [or salary] offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514, or other statutory or common law.    (b) Offset shall not be used to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the Government who were charged with the responsibility of discovering and collecting such debt.    (c) Offset shall not be used with respect to: (1) Debts owed by other agencies of the United States or by any State or local government;    (2) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or tariff laws of the United States; or     (3) Any case in which collection by offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.    (d) Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments which are not subject to offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 or 5 U.S.C. 5514 may be collected by offset if such collection is authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.        &sect;1408.21     Collection by offset.        (a) Collection of a debt by administrative [or salary] offset shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, 4 CFR 102.3, and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. It is not necessary for the debt to be reduced to judgment or to be undisputed for offset to be used.    (b) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may determine that it is feasible to collect a debt to the United States by offset against funds payable to the debtor.     (c) The feasibility of collecting a debt by offset will be determined on a case-by-case basis. This determination shall be made by considering all relevant factors, including the following: (1) The degree to which the offset can be accomplished in accordance with law. This determination should take into consideration relevant statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements;     (2) The degree to which the Corporation is certain that its determination of the existence and amount of the debt is correct;    (3) The practicality of collecting the debt by offset. The cost, in time and money, of collecting the debt by offset and the amount of money which can reasonably be expected to be recovered through offset will be relevant to this determination; and    (4) Whether the use of offset will substantially interfere with or defeat the purpose of a program authorizing payments against which the offset is contemplated. For example, under a grant program in which payments are made in advance of the grantee's performance, the imposition of offset against such a payment may be inappropriate.    (d) The collection of a debt by offset may not be feasible when there are circumstances which would indicate that the likelihood of collection by offset is less than probable.    (e) The offset will be effected 31 days after the debtor receives a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset (or Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset if the offset is a salary offset), or upon the expiration of a stay of offset, unless the Corporation determines under &sect;1408.24 that immediate action is necessary.

The debtor shall be informed that to obtain a review, the debtor shall deliver a written request for a review to the Corporation official named in the Notice, within 15 calendar days after the debtor's receipt of the Notice. In the case of a salary offset, the debtor shall also be informed that the review shall be conducted by an official arranged for by the Corporation who shall be a hearing official not under the control of the Chairman of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, or an administrative law judge;   (6) That the filing of a petition for hearing within 15 calendar days after receipt of the Notice will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;   (7) That a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the written request for review unless the employee requests, and the hearing official grants, a delay in the proceedings;   (8) The right of the debtor to offer to enter into a written agreement with the Corporation to repay the amount of the claim. The debtor shall be informed that the acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the Corporation;   (9) That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs shall be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if payment is not received by the payment due date. The debtor shall be informed that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 103 and 104);   (10) The amount of accrued interest and the amount of any other penalties or administrative costs which may have been added to the principal debt;   (11) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the Corporation to pay the debt, has not requested the Corporation to review the debt, or has not paid the debt prior to the date on which the offset is to be imposed, the Corporation intends to collect the debt by administrative [or salary] offset or by requesting other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset.

(a)(1) Any creditor agency which requests the Corporation to impose an offset against amounts owed to the debtor shall submit to the Corporation a claim certification which meets the requirements of this paragraph. The Corporation shall submit the same certification to any agency that the Corporation requests to effect an offset.   (2) The claim certification shall be in writing. It shall certify the debtor owes the debt and that all of the applicable requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met. If the intended offset is to be a salary offset, a claim certification shall instead certify that the debtor owes the debt and that the applicable requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met.   (3) A certification that the debtor owes the debt shall state the amount of the debt, the factual basis supporting the determination of indebtedness, and the date on which payment of the debt was due. A certification that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met shall include a statement that the debtor has been sent a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset at least 31 calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a statement that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not required to be sent. A certification that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met shall include a statement that the debtor has been sent a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset at least 31 calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a statement that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not required to be sent.   (b)(1) The Corporation shall not effect an offset requested by another Federal agency without first obtaining the claim certification required by paragraph (a) of this section. If the Corporation receives an incomplete claim certification, the Corporation shall return the claim certification with notice that a claim certification which complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to the Corporation before the Corporation will consider effecting an offset.   (2) The Corporation may rely on the information contained in the claim certification provided by a requesting creditor agency. The Corporation is not authorized to review a creditor agency's determination of indebtedness.   (c) Only the creditor agency may agree to enter into an agreement with the debtor for the repayment of the claim. Only the creditor agency may agree to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection of the claim.   (d) The Corporation may decline, for good cause, a request by another agency to effect an offset. Good cause includes that the offset might disrupt, directly or indirectly, essential Corporation operations. The refusal and the reasons shall be sent in writing to the creditor agency.       &sect;1408.26     Stay of offset.       (a)(1) When a creditor agency receives a debtor's request for inspection of agency records, the offset is stayed for 10 calendar days beyond the date set for the record inspection.   (2) When a creditor agency receives a debtor's offer to enter into a repayment agreement, the offset is stayed until the debtor is notified as to whether the proposed agreement is acceptable.   (3) When a review is conducted, the offset is stayed until the creditor agency issues a final written decision.   (b) When offset is stayed, the amount of the debt and the amount of any accrued interest or other charges will be withheld from payments to the debtor. The withheld amounts shall not be applied against the debt until the stay expires. If withheld funds are later determined not to be subject to offset, they will be promptly refunded to the debtor.

text: nullnull      Subpart C_Offset Against Salary       &sect;1408.35     Purpose.       The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 5 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365 (5 U.S.C. 5514)), which authorizes the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offsets. These regulations provide procedures for the collection of a debt owed to the Government by the imposition of a salary offset against amounts payable to a Federal employee as salary. These regulations are consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel Management, codified in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. Since salary offset is a type of administrative offset, the requirements of subpart B also apply to salary offsets.       &sect;1408.36     Applicability of regulations.       (a) These regulations apply to the following cases: (1) Where the Corporation is owed a debt by an individual currently employed by another agency;   (2) Where the Corporation is owed a debt by an individual who is currently employed by the Corporation; or   (3) Where the Corporation currently employs an individual who owes a debt to another Federal agency. Upon receipt of proper certification from the creditor agency, the Corporation will offset the debtor-employee's salary in accordance with these regulations.   (b) These regulations do not apply to the following: (1) Debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1     et seq.    ); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301     et seq.    ); the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).   (2) Any adjustment to pay arising from an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.   (3) A claim which has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the creditor agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection of such debts.       &sect;1408.37     Definitions.       In this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:   (a)     Agency     means:     (1) An executive agency as defined by 5 U.S.C. 105, including the United States Postal Service and the United States Postal Rate Commission;   (2) A military department as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102;   (3) An agency or court of the judicial branch, including a court as defined in 28 U.S.C. 610, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation;   (4) An agency of the legislative branch, including the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives; or   (5) Other independent establishments that are entities of the Federal Government.   (b)     Disposable pay     means, for an officially established pay interval, that part of current basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or, in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay remaining after the deduction of any amount required by law to be withheld. The Corporation shall allow the deductions described in 5 CFR 581.105 (b) through (f).   (c)     Employee     means a current employee of the Corporation or other agency, including a current member of the Armed Forces or Reserve of the Armed Forces of the United States.   (d)     Waiver     means the cancellation, remission, forgiveness, or nonrecovery of a debt allegedly owed by an employee to the Corporation or another agency as permitted or required by 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or any other law.       &sect;1408.38     Waiver requests and claims to the General Accounting Office.       (a) The regulations contained in this subpart do not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or in any way questioning the amount or validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the General Accounting Office.   (b) These regulations also do not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver pursuant to other statutory provisions pertaining to the particular debts being collected.       &sect;1408.39     Procedures for salary offset.       (a) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, shall determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay and the amount to be deducted from the employee's disposable pay at regular pay intervals.

text: nullnull      (c)(1) If the amount of the debt is equal to or is less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay, such debt should be collected in one lump-sum deduction.     (2) If the amount of the debt is not collected in one lump-sum deduction, the debt shall be collected in installment deductions over a period of time not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any pay period will not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay for that period, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.     (3) A deduction exceeding the 15-percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.     (4) Whenever an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Corporation and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the Corporation may offset any later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt.     (d) In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets against current employees of the Corporation or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Corporation, at its discretion, may determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15-percent limitation. Debts owed to the Corporation should generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies.         &sect;1408.40    Refunds.         (a) In instances where the Corporation is the creditor agency, it shall promptly refund any amounts deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 when:     (1) The debt is waived or otherwise found not to be owed to the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulations); or     (2) An administrative or judicial order directs the Corporation to make a refund.     (b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under this section shall not bear interest.         &sect;1408.41    Requesting current paying agency to offset salary.         (a) To request a paying agency to impose a salary offset against amounts owed to the debtor, the Corporation shall provide the paying agency with a claim certification which meets the requirements set forth in &sect;1408.25(a) of this part. The Corporation shall also provide the paying agency with a repayment schedule determined under the provisions of &sect;1408.39 or in accordance with a repayment agreement entered into with the debtor.     (b) If the employee separates from the paying agency before the debt is paid in full, the paying agency shall certify the total amount collected on the debt. A copy of this certification shall be sent to the employee and a copy shall be sent to the Corporation. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, the Corporation must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.     (c) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the Corporation is not required to repeat the due process procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this part to resume the collection. The Corporation shall, however, review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.     (d) If a special review is conducted pursuant to &sect;1408.11 and results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Corporation shall provide a new claim certification to the paying agency.

(a) When the Corporation receives a claim certification from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval. The Corporation shall send the debtor written notice which provides: (1) That the Corporation has received a valid claim certification from the creditor agency;     (2) The date on which salary offset will begin;     (3) The amount of the debt; and     (4) The amount of such deductions.     (b) If, after the creditor agency has submitted the claim certification to the Corporation, the employee transfers to a different agency before the debt is collected in full, the Corporation must certify the total amount collected on the debt.

This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Request for Comments on the Rule      Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES    '' section. However, after the review of the comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation.  Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.      The Rule      This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace areas at Greater Rockford Airport, Rockford, IL, Cincinnati Municipal Airport Lunken Field, Cincinnati, OH, Jackson County-Reynolds Field, Jackson, MI, Tri City International Airport, Saginaw, MI, Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City, MI, Joe Foss Field, Sioux Falls, SD, and Rochester Municipal Airport, Rochester, MN, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed.                                    14 CFR Part 71        <RINDOCK>[Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;16]</RINDOCK>      Modification of Class D Airspace; and Establishment of Class E Airspace; Rockford, IL, Cincinnati, OH, Jackson, MI, Saginaw, MI, Traverse City, MI, Sioux Falls, SD, and Rochester, MN     <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.       </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule; request for comments.          </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This action modifies Class D airspace areas at Greater Rockford Airport, Rockford, IL, Cincinnati Municipal Airport Lunken Field, Cincinnati, OH, Jackson County-Reynolds Field, Jackson, MI, Tri City International Airport, Saginaw, MI, Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City, MI, Joe Foss Field, Sioux Falls, SD, and Rochester Municipal Airport, Rochester, MN, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation.

text: nullnull      The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D and establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.        List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71        Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).

text: nullnull      The Rule        This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace areas at Dubuque Regional Airport, Iowa; Sioux City, Sioux Gateway Airport, Iowa; Waterloo Municipal Airport, Iowa; Fort Leavenworth, Sherman Army Air Field, Kansas; Fort Riley, Marshall Army Air Field, Kansas; Hutchinson Municipal Airport, Kansas; Manhattan Municipal Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Executive Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Industrial Airport, Kansas; Salina Municipal Airport, Kansas; Topeka, Forbes Field, Kansas; and Topeka, Philip Billard Airport, Kansas. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Dubuque Regional Airport, Iowa; Sioux City, Sioux Gateway Airport, Iowa; Waterloo Municipal Airport, Iowa; Fort Leavenworth, Sherman Army Air Field, Kansas; Fort Riley, Marshall Army Air Field, Kansas; Hutchinson Municipal Airport, Kansas; Manhattan Municipal Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Executive Airport, Kansas; Olathe, Johnson County Industrial Airport, Kansas; Salina Municipal Airport, Kansas; Topeka, Forbes Field, Kansas; and Topeka, Philip Billard Airport, Kansas, when the towers are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at these airports when these control towers are closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the     Federal Register     on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).    The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.        List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71        Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).        Adoption of the Amendment        In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows:

Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers, is required.    The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83.

The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers, is required.    The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Presently, these areas are designated as Class D airspace when the associated control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control towers located at these areas are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations when these control towers are closed.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Request for Comments on the Rule      Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES'' section. However, after the review of the comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation.  Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.      The Rule      This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace areas at Chicago/Waukegan, IL, Lafayette, IN, Willoughby, OH, Mosinee, WI, and La Crosse, WI.

Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at the Cape Girardeau Municipal Airport, Missouri; Columbia Regional Airport, Missouri; Fort Leonard Wood, Forney Army Airfield, Missouri; Jefferson City Memorial Airport, Missouri; Joplin Regional Airport, Missouri; Kansas City, Richards-Gebaur Airport, Missouri; Knob Noster, Whiteman Air Force Base (AFB), Missouri; Springfield Regional Airport, Missouri; St. Joseph, Rosecrans Memorial Airport, Missouri; St. Louis, Spirit of St. Louis Airport, Missouri; and Grand Island, Central Nebraska Regional Airport, Nebraska, when the control towers are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at these airports when these control towers are closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the     Federal Register     on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).      </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.        List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71        Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (Air).        Adoption of the Amendment        In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows:        PART 71_[AMENDED]        1.

text:   SUMMARY:     On September 17, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule altering the Denver, CO, Class B airspace area. On January 20, 1994, a correction to the final rule was published to correct certain airport reference point and navigational aid (NAVAID) coordinates for the new airport, and to reflect that the Denver Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) has been upgraded to a Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) facility. In view of further delay in the opening date of the new Denver International Airport, this action delays the rule's effective date indefinitely.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On September 17, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule altering the Denver, CO, Class B airspace area. Subsequently, on November 17, 1993, a delay of effective date was published and on January 20, 1994, a correction to the final rule was published to correct an error in the coordinates for the airport reference point and the supporting NAVAID for the new Denver International Airport, and to reflect that the Denver VOR has been upgraded to a VOR/DME facility. Most recently, the FAA had delayed this rule until May 15, 1994. The official opening of the Denver International Airport has now been delayed indefinitely due to the automatic baggage system difficulties.         Accordingly, the effective date of the alteration and correction of the related Class B airspace area should be delayed indefinitely. Once the opening date of the new airport is determined, the FAA will publish another rule indicating the effective date of this rule.       Because the public needs to be made aware of this delay immediately, notice and public procedure are impracticable and good cause exists for making this action effective in less than 30 days.       In consideration of the foregoing, effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the final rule altering the Denver, CO, Class B airspace area (58 FR 48722; September 17, 1993), as delayed at 58 FR 60552 (November 17, 1993), as corrected at 59 FR 2953 (January 20, 1994), and as delayed at 59 FR 10744 (March 8, 1994), is delayed indefinitely.

text:   SUMMARY:     On January 12, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule altering Jet Route J&hyph;171 from Tobe, CO, to Hugo, CO. This action accommodated the new Denver International Airport airspace reconfiguration. In view of the delay in the opening date of the new Denver International Airport, this action delays the rule's effective date indefinitely.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On January 12, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule altering Jet Route J&hyph;171 from Tobe, CO, to Hugo, CO, to accommodate the new Denver International Airport airspace reconfiguration. Most recently, the FAA had delayed this rule until May 15, 1994. The official opening of the Denver International Airport has been delayed indefinitely due to the automatic baggage system difficulties. Accordingly, the effective date of this jet route alteration should be delayed indefinitely. Once the opening date of the new airport is determined, the FAA will publish another rule indicating the effective date of this rule.         Because the public needs to be made aware of this delay immediately, notice and public procedure are impracticable and good cause exists for making this action effective in less than 30 days.     In consideration of the foregoing, effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the final rule altering the Jet Route J&hyph;171, (59 FR 1619; January 12, 1994) as delayed at 59 FR 10744 (March 8, 1994), is delayed indefinitely.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On January 19, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule intending to indicate in sections 1 and 3 of appendix D, 14 CFR part 91 that on March 9, 1994 the new Denver International Airport will open, replacing the Stapleton International Airport (Amendment No. 91&hyph;236; 59 FR 2918).

text:   SUMMARY:     This action modifies Federal Airway V&hyph;229 located in Connecticut. This action is necessary to accommodate airspace users, reduce air traffic control (ATC) coordination and improve operations. The description for V&hyph;229 is also being changed to eliminate the exclusionary language regarding R&hyph;5002A, R&hyph;5002E, V&hyph;139 and V&hyph;308. In addition, this action will correct an inadvertent error in the airway description that reversed the Hartford true and magnetic radials.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    History        On November 1, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify V&hyph;229 between the Hartford, CT, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility and the Gardner, MA, VORTAC. It also proposed to eliminate the exclusionary language regarding R&hyph;5002A, R&hyph;5002E, V&hyph;139 and V&hyph;308 (58 FR 58312). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes and the correction to the Hartford 040  &cir; radial, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airway listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.        The Rule        This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies V&hyph;229 between the Hartford, CT, VORTAC and the Gardner, MA, VORTAC. Realigning the airway will accommodate the airspace users, reduce ATC coordination, and improve operations.    The airspace designation for V&hyph;229 presently excludes R&hyph;5002A, R&hyph;5002E, V&hyph;139 and V&hyph;308. These exclusions are being removed because the airspace boundaries of the restricted areas and the airways do not overlap the airspace of V&hyph;229. In addition, the Hartford true and magnetic radials used to define an intersection on V&hyph;229 were reversed. This action corrects the description to read ``INT Hartford 040  &cir;T(053  &cir;M).''    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

text:   SUMMARY:     This action modifies the Pasco, Washington, Tri-cities Airport, Class D airspace by excluding additional airspace overlying the Vista Field Airport, Kennewick, Washington. This action will allow operations to and from the Vista Field Airport without radio communication with the Pasco Airport Traffic Control Tower.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           History        On April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by modifying the Class D airspace for Tri-Cities Airport, Pasco, Washington (59 FR 15668). Airspace within a .9-mile radius of Vista Field Airport is presently excluded from the Pasco Class D airspace. Recent construction at the Vista Field airport has resulted in closure of the east-west runway, requiring aircraft operating to runway 02/20 to fly over the Columbia River outside the present airspace exclusion. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.        The Rule        This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Pasco, Washington by excluding additional airspace overlying the Vista Field Airport Kennewick, Washington. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal.

Airspace within a .9-mile radius of Vista Field Airport is presently excluded from the Pasco Class D airspace. Recent construction at the Vista Field airport has resulted in closure of the east-west runway, requiring aircraft operating to runway 02/20 to fly over the Columbia River outside the present airspace exclusion. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.        The Rule        This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Pasco, Washington by excluding additional airspace overlying the Vista Field Airport Kennewick, Washington. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

text:   SUMMARY:     This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with the air traffic control tower is required.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    Request for Comments on the Rule          Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES     section. However, after the review of any comments, and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.    Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.        The Rule        This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at this airport. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with this air traffic control tower is required.    The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to modify this Class D airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in this area. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal.

text:   SUMMARY:     This action amends certain Class D and Class E airspace published in a final rule in the     Federal Register     on March 11, 1994. That final rule updated Class D and Class E airspace areas in the New England Region based on a region-wide review of Class D and Class E airspace for conformity with the requirements of the United States Standards for Terminal Procedures (TERPS). This action amends technical errors in the classification and description of certain airspace areas contained in FAA Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         History         On July 26, 1993, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to update certain control zones and transition areas in the New England Region (58 FR 39693). That NPRM was prompted by a region-wide review of control zones and transition areas for conformity with the United States Standards for Terminal Procedures (TERPS). That review revealed a need to make revisions to many of those airspace areas in the New England region.     After publication of that NPRM, all airspace areas in the United States were reclassified according to the standards adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). (See, Airspace Reclassification final rule, 56 FR 65638.) Airspace Reclassification, effective on September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the terms ``control zone'' and ``transition area,'' and reclassified those areas respectively as either Class D or Class E airspace.     The FAA published the final rule to revise airspace areas in the vicinity of airports in the New England region on March 11, 1994 (59 FR 11535). That final rule contained airspace descriptions of the former ``control zones'' and ``transition areas'' translated into Class D and Class E classifications.         The Amendment         The final rule, however, contained minor errors introduced during the process of translating the descriptions into Class D and Class E classifications. Specifically, three airspace areas with no operating airport traffic control tower (ATCT) were listed Class D instead of Class E; Augusta, ME, Houlton, ME and Presque Isle, ME. One area was listed as Class D instead of as a Class E extension to a Class D area; Brunswick, ME. Two Class E areas, listed as extensions to Class D areas, require correction because of the changes made to those Class D areas; Hartford, CT, Portsmouth, NH.     In addition, this action makes three general revisions to the descriptions of certain airspace areas, which delete language introduced into the descriptions during the translation process. Some descriptions of former transition areas, now Class E airspace, contained language that excluded from those areas airspace defined as higher class airspace. This language is no longer needed because of the general rule of airspace classification under the ICAO standards that higher class airspace always takes precedence. Further, when modified to fit the new airspace classifications and to meet the TERPS requirements, certain descriptions no longer used some airway facilities, therefore, the definition and location of those unused facilities is no longer needed in the airspace description. Lastly, this action corrects the description of Class E airspace defined as extensions to higher class airspace by deleting altitude limits, not needed because of the general rule that Class E airspace extends upward to the base of the overlying airspace. Finally, this action makes minor typographical changes.     This document reprints the entire airspace description for those areas needing correction. This action is necessary to correct errors in the descriptions of certain Class D and Class E airspace areas in the New England region.     The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.                   14 CFR Part 71           <RINDOCK>[Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;19] </RINDOCK>      Update of Class D and Class E Airspace in the New England Region        <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule; technical amendment.          </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This action amends certain Class D and Class E airspace published in a final rule in the     Federal Register     on March 11, 1994.

In addition, this action makes three general revisions to the descriptions of certain airspace areas, which delete language introduced into the descriptions during the translation process. Some descriptions of former transition areas, now Class E airspace, contained language that excluded from those areas airspace defined as higher class airspace. This language is no longer needed because of the general rule of airspace classification under the ICAO standards that higher class airspace always takes precedence. Further, when modified to fit the new airspace classifications and to meet the TERPS requirements, certain descriptions no longer used some airway facilities, therefore, the definition and location of those unused facilities is no longer needed in the airspace description. Lastly, this action corrects the description of Class E airspace defined as extensions to higher class airspace by deleting altitude limits, not needed because of the general rule that Class E airspace extends upward to the base of the overlying airspace. Finally, this action makes minor typographical changes.     This document reprints the entire airspace description for those areas needing correction. This action is necessary to correct errors in the descriptions of certain Class D and Class E airspace areas in the New England region.     The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.       </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      This action clarifies the existing rule and does not place any new restriction or requirements on the public. Furthermore, the FAA finds that this amendment does not involve a change in the dimensions or operating requirements of the airspace listings incorporated by reference in part 71. These errors are insignificant in nature and impact and inconsequential to the industry and public. Therefore, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Additionally, in consideration of the immediate need to advise pilots of the corrections to the classification and description of certain airspace areas, the FAA finds good cause, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days in order to promote the safe operation of aircraft in this area.

text:   SUMMARY:     This action establishes Class E airspace at South Lake Tahoe, CA. A Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA)/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The establishment of Class E airspace will provide adequate airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  History      On March 15, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish a Class E Airspace area at South Lake Tahoe, CA. (59 FR 14804). An SIAP was being developed for the South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport at South Lake Tahoe, CA. This will add controlled airspace extending from the surface for IFR operations at South Lake Tahoe Municipal Airport. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal. The coordinates in the proposal were based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from the surface designated as an extension to a Class D surface area are published in Paragraph 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order.      The Rule      This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation establishes Class E airspace at South Lake Tahoe, CA. This action will provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the LDA/DME&hyph;1/2 approaches at South Lake Tahoe, CA.  The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

text:   SUMMARY:     This action amends the Idaho Falls, Idaho, Class E airspace. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) is necessary to accommodate an amendment to an instrument approach procedure for the Fanning Field Airport, Idaho Falls, Idaho. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' The airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   History        On April 11, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending the Idaho Falls, Idaho, Class E airspace (59 FR 17055). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received.    Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' and certain airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are now Class E airspace areas. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.        The Rule        This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class E airspace at Idaho Falls, Idaho. This action is necessary to accommodate an amendment to an instrument approach procedure for the Fanning Field Airport, Idaho Falls, Idaho.    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.                          14 CFR Part 71          <RINDOCK>[Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;46]</RINDOCK>      Amendment of Class E Airspace; Idaho Falls, ID       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This action amends the Idaho Falls, Idaho, Class E airspace.

Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         History        On Tuesday, March 29, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class E airspace at Warroad International-Swede Carlson Field, Warroad, MN (59 FR 14574).

Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.        The Rule        This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to modify Class E airspace at Warroad International-Swede Carlson Field, Warroad, MN, to accommodate Instrument Landing System (ILS) Runway 31, and Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) Runway 31 Standard Instrument Approach (SIAP). Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach.    Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements.    The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This action is necessary to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal area in western Montana. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' and certain airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are now Class E airspace areas. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace is published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.        The Rule        This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at Kalispell, Montana. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     In the     Federal Register     of December 14, 1993 (58 FR 65514), FDA published an interim rule on human tissue intended for transplantation. This interim rule requires certain infectious disease testing, donor screening, and recordkeeping to help prevent the transmission of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis through human tissue used in transplantation. The regulations set forth in the interim rule became effective upon publication. Interested persons were given until March 14, 1994, to comment on the interim rule.       The objective of this public workshop is to discuss practical concerns expressed in received public comments relating to the implementation of the interim rule. The following topics will be discussed:   1. Experience with the interim rule;   2. Management of testing relative to hemodilution;   3. Experience with test kit performance on cadaveric blood samples; and 4. Management of current inventories in regard to testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).      Discussion of these topics will be considered by FDA in the development of any future rulemaking.       FDA is reopening the comment period to the interim rule so that interested persons may submit comments on the workshop. Persons who wish to provide additional materials for consideration should file these materials with the Dockets Management Branch (address above).   Interested persons may, on or before August 20, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above), written comments regarding this document.

text:   SUMMARY:     On July 22, 1993, the Department published a major revision to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (58 FR 39280). After being in use by government agencies and industry for several months, certain issues were identified which required revision. The revisions made in this final rule are viewed by the Department of State as beneficial for U.S. persons and industry.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On July 22, 1993, the Department published a major revision to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (58 FR 39280). After several months of implementation and various training seminars with other government agencies and with industry, several issues have been identified which merit regulatory or procedural changes. This final rule is being published to address three (3) of the issues. Section 123.16(a) is revised to exclude significant military equipment from the exemption stated in &sect;123.16. This change was deemed necessary in order to ensure compliance with the Department's congressional notification requirements and the ITAR requirement for nontransfer and use certification for defense articles which are defined in part 120 of the ITAR as ``significant military equipment''. In addition, &sect;124.10 is amended by removing the requirement that a signed DSP&hyph;83 be submitted with proposed agreements. Compliance with this requirement has proven to be difficult, and of insufficient benefit to the Department to merit continuation of the requirement. Finally, &sect;126.5 is amended by deleting the exception to the Canadian exemption which requires a license for the export to Canada of unclassified technical data directly related to a classified defense article.        The Department of State views these changes as beneficial for U.S. persons and industry and has decided to implement them immediately by publication of a final rule. Notwithstanding this final rule, public comment is welcomed.    This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States. It is exempt from review under E.O. 12866 and has been reviewed internally by the Department of State to ensure consistency with the purposes thereof. It is also excluded from the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554.

Section 124.10 is revised to read as follows:        &sect;124.10    Nontransfer and use assurances.        (a)     Types of agreements requiring assurances.     With respect to any manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement which relates to significant military equipment or classified defense articles, including classified technical data, a Nontransfer and Use Certificate (Form DSP&hyph;83) (see &sect;123.10 of this subchapter) signed by the applicant and the foreign party must be submitted to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. With respect to all agreements involving classified articles, including classified technical data, an authorized representative of the foreign government must sign the DSP&hyph;83 (or provide the same assurances in the form of a diplomatic note), unless the Office of Defense Trade Controls has granted an exception to this requirement. The Office of Defense Trade controls may require that a DSP&hyph;83 be provided in conjunction with an agreement that does not relate to significant military equipment or classified defense articles. The Office of Defense Trade Controls may also require with respect to any agreement that an appropriate authority of the foreign party's government also sign the DSP&hyph;83 (or provide the same assurances in the form of a diplomatic note).

text:   SUMMARY:     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision request adopted by the Indiana Pollution Control Board on July 21, 1993, and formally submitted by the state of Indiana on January 6, 1994, for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the ozone nonattainment counties of Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, and Vanderburgh. The implementation plan was submitted by the state to satisfy the Federal requirements for an emission statement program as part of the SIP for Indiana.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:        I. Summary of State Submittal        On July 21, 1993, the Indiana Pollution Control Board adopted and on January 6, 1994, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) formally submitted to the USEPA a request to approve the July 21, 1993, adopted emission statement regulations, codified as 326 IAC 2&hyph;6. This submission addresses the emission statement requirements which are found in section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended (1990 Amendments).    Section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Act states that, within 2 years after the enactment of the Act, states with ozone nonattainment areas (classified as marginal or worse) must submit revisions to their SIPs to require the owners or operators of stationary sources of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) or Oxides of Nitrogen (NO    X    ) to provide the states with statements, in a form acceptable to the USEPA, showing actual emissions of NO    X     and/or VOC from the sources. The first emission statements must be submitted within 3 years of the enactment of the Act. Subsequent statements are to be submitted annually thereafter. These statements must contain certifications of accuracy.   Section 182(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act specifies that the states may waive the requirements for emission statements for any class or category of sources which emit less than 25 tons per year if the states, through the submission of base year emission inventories or periodic emission inventories (required to be submitted to the USEPA every three years), provide for the reporting of the emissions from the exempted source classes or categories and emissions are determined using emission factors acceptable to the USEPA.        II. Analysis of State Submittal        The criteria used to review the submitted SIP revisions are found in USEPA's draft Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program, (July 1992). It should be noted that this guideline has not been finalized, but does provide current USEPA guidance on the contents of emission statements and on the states' use of emission statements. For this reason, the July 1992 draft guidance has been used for the technical review of this submission. It should be noted that the USEPA intends to incorporate the guidelines contained in the July 1992 guidance into the Code of Federal Regulations in the near future.    The July 1992 guidance describes the following requirements for emission statement SIP revisions:    1. Regardless of what minimum emission reporting level is established, if either VOC or NO    X     is emitted at or above the established minimum reporting level, the emissions of both VOC and NO    X     should be reported;    2. The emission statements should, at minimum, include the following data:                            <USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</USDEPT>       40 CFR Part 52                   Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plan; Indiana       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Environmental Protection Agency.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.          </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision request adopted by the Indiana Pollution Control Board on July 21, 1993, and formally submitted by the state of Indiana on January 6, 1994, for the purpose of implementing an emission statement program for stationary sources within the ozone nonattainment counties of Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, and Vanderburgh.

text: nullnull      a. Certification of data accuracy; to be made by an officer of the reporting company who will take legal responsibility for the accuracy of the reported data;    b. Source identification information;    c. Operating schedules;    d. Emissions information, including both annual and typical ozone season daily emissions;    e. Control equipment information; and    f. Process data.    3. States must incorporate the emission statement data into an annual point source emissions submittal to the USEPA. This annual emissions submittal is first due to the USEPA by July 1, 1993;    4. In addition to the submittal of emission statements and the annual point source emissions report, the USEPA is also requesting that states submit an Emissions Statement Status Report (ESSR) beginning by July 1, 1993. The ESSR is to be submitted quarterly each year until all applicable sources have submitted emission statements. The ESSR should individually list the source facilities that are delinquent in submitting emission statements. The ESSR should also include the total annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all source facilities submitting emission statements prior to the ESSR submittal;    5. States are required to use the data collected through the emission statement program to annually update the facility-specific data contained in the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) by July 1st of each year; and        6. States must commit to retain emission statement data and submittals for a period of at least three years.    Indiana's submittal contains the adopted regulations that will apply to source facilities and that specify what data are to be submitted. The remainder of this technical review will be dedicated to reviewing the contents and technical merits of the state's adopted regulations and the accompanying state commitments.    As noted above, the emission statement regulations are codified as 326 IAC 2&hyph;6. The provisions of the regulations are outlined as follows:        Applicability        The emission statement regulations are applicable to all sources of VOC or NO    X     with the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of VOC or NO    X     in the Counties of: Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, and Vanderburgh. The regulations are also applicable to sources of Carbon Monoxide (CO), VOC, NO    X    , Particulate Matter (PM), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO    2    ) which have the potential to emit 100 tons per year or more and to sources of Lead (Pb) which have the potential to emit 5 tons per year or more in the State of Indiana. If the emissions from a facility surpass the emission cutoff for any of these pollutants, the emissions of all the named pollutants must be addressed in the submitted emission statement.        Definitions        The definitions in 326 IAC 2&hyph;6 applicable to the emission statement regulations and of greatest relevance to the emission statement regulations are summarized here.        Actual emissions     means the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant from an emissions unit for the calendar year or seasonal period.        Annual process rate     means the actual or estimated annual fuel, process, or solid waste operating rate in an emission statement operating year.        Certifying individual     means the individual responsible for the completion and certification of the emission statement, such as an officer of the company or an employee, who will take legal responsibility for the accuracy of the emission statement.        Control efficiency     means the actual emission control efficiency achieved by the applicable emission control device(s) during the emission statement operating year. The control efficiency must reflect control equipment downtime, operation with diminished effectiveness, and any other malfunctions that occurred while the emission source(s) were in operation. If the actual control efficiency during the emission statement operating year is unknown or cannot reasonably be predicted from available data, then the efficiency designed by the manufacturer may be used. When the actual control efficiency is unknown, it should be clearly indicated that the design efficiency, and not the actual efficiency, is being reported.        Control equipment identification code     means the AIRS or AIRS Facility Subsystem (AFS) code which defines the equipment used to reduce by destruction or removal the amount of air pollutant in an air stream prior to discharge to the ambient air.        Downtime     means the period of time when the control device is not operational during the corresponding period of the process.        Emission factor     means an estimate of the rate at which a pollutant is released to the atmosphere as the result of some activity, divided by the rate of that activity, such as production rate or throughput.        Emission statement operating year     means the 12 consecutive month time period starting December 1 and ending November 30 for those sources located in Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, or Vanderburgh Counties with the potential to emit VOC or NO    X     into the ambient air at levels equal to or greater than 10 tons per year, or the 12 consecutive month time period starting January 1 and ending December 31 for all other sources to which the emission statement regulations apply (see the discussion of applicability above).        Estimated emissions method code     means a one position (one character) AIRS or AFS code which identifies the estimation technique used in the calculation of estimated emissions.        Fugitive emission     means releases to the air that are not emitted through stacks, vents, ducts, pipes, or any other confined air stream. Fugitive emissions include equipment leaks, evaporative losses from surface impoundments, and releases from building ventilation systems.        Peak ozone season     means the contiguous three-month period of the year from June through August.        Percentage annual throughput     means:    1. The weighted percent of yearly activity for those sources located in Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, or Vanderburgh Counties with the potential to emit VOC or NO    X     into the ambient air at levels equal to or greater than 10 tons per year and for the following periods:    a. December through February;    b. March through May;    c. June through August; and    d. September through November.    2. The weighted percent of yearly activity for all other sources to which the emission statement regulations apply for the following periods:

Plant     means the total facilities available for production or service.       Point     means a physical emission point or process, such as a distinct   building or a portion of a building, within a plant that results in pollutant   emissions.       Process rate     means a quantity per unit of time of any raw material or   process intermediate consumed, or product generated through the use of any   equipment, source operation, or process. For a stationary internal combustion   unit or any other fuel burning equipment, this term means the quantity of fuel   burned per unit time.

Stack     means a (smoke) stack or vent within a plant where emissions are     introduced into the atmosphere.       Stationary source     means any building, structure, facility, or   installation which emits, or may emit, any air pollutant subject to   regulation under Indiana Code 13&hyph;1&hyph;1 (IC 13&hyph;1&hyph;1).       Typical ozone season day     means a day typical of that period of the   year during the peak ozone season.            Compliance Schedule       The owner or operator of any source facility located   in Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, or Vanderburgh   Counties with the potential to emit VOC or NO    X     into the ambient air at levels   equal to or greater than 10 tons per year must annually submit an emission   statement to the Commissioner (of IDEM) by April 15. The owners or operators   of other sources to which the emission statement regulations apply must   annually submit an emission statement to the Commissioner by July 1. The   submittals must cover the time periods covered under the definition of   ``emission statement operating year.''       Requirements       The emission statement submitted by each applicable   facility must contain the following information:   1. Certification that the information contained in the emission   statement is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the   emission statement. The certification must include the full name, title,   signature, date of signature, and telephone number of the certifying   individual. The certifying individual shall be employed by the company and   shall take legal responsibility for the accuracy of the emission statement;   2. Source identification information including: (a) The full name,   physical location, and mailing address of the facility; (b) source latitude   and longitude; and (c) SIC code(s);   3. Operating data, to include the following:   a. Percent annual throughput by quarter:   i. For those sources of VOC or NO    X     with the potential to emit equal   to or more than 10 tons per year of VOC or NO    X     in the Counties of:   Clark; Elkhart; Floyd; Lake; Marion; Porter; St. Joseph; and Vanderburgh,   the quarters are defined as follows:   (AA) December through February;   (BB) March through May;

In addition to the requirements of the emission statement regulations,   the emission statement SIP revision submittal also contains IDEM commitments   to the following:   1. IDEM will update the AIRS facility subsystem using the annual   emissions report data. The data required by the Act will be entered   into AIRS by July 1st each year. The data required by 40 CFR part 51   will be updated into AIRS by September 1 of each year.   2. IDEM will retain the annual emission reports on file for at least   3 years.   3. IDEM will develop and submit to the USEPA a status report that   outlines the degree of compliance with the emission statement program. IDEM   will report quarterly to the USEPA, the total number of sources affected by   the emission statement regulations, the number of sources that have complied   with the emission statement regulations, and the number of sources that have   not. The status report will also include the total annual and typical ozone   season day emissions from all reporting VOC and NO    X     sources located   in Clark, Elkhart, Floyd, Lake, Marion, Porter, St. Joseph, and Vanderburgh Counties, both corrected and non-corrected for rule effectiveness. Sources   that are delinquent in submitting their emission statements will be   individually listed if they emit 500 tons per year or more of VOC or 2,500   tons per year or more of NO    X    . The quarterly status reports will be submitted   July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1 of each year.       III. Final Action       IDEM's adopted annual emissions reporting   regulations submitted on January 6, 1994, are acceptable under section   182(a)(3)(B) of the Act and USEPA's draft guidelines.   Because USEPA considers today's action noncontroversial and routine,   we are approving it today without prior proposal. The action will become   effective on August 9, 1994. However, if we receive notice by July 11, 1994 that someone wishes to submit   adverse comments, then USEPA will publish: (1) A document that withdraws the   action; and (2) a document that begins a new action by proposing the action   and establishing a comment period.

text: nullnull      Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.   This has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under procedures published in the     Federal Register     on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.   Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600     et seq.    , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.   SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does   not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.     Union Electric Co.     v.     USEPA     427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a) (2).   Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of   this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

This revision establishes and requires Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities throughout the State of Delaware. The intended effect of this action is to approve these regulations to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act (the Act).              SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6608), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Delaware. The NPR proposed approval of the addition of section 36 and appendix J to Regulation No. 24, Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations, into Delaware's ozone SIP. Delaware formally submitted section 36 and appendix J of Regulation No. 24 to EPA as a SIP revision on January 11, 1993, to comply with the Stage II vapor recovery requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act.         This rulemaking action is approving the addition of section 36 and appendix J into the Delaware ozone SIP. Section 36 and appendix J requires Stage II vapor recovery at gasoline dispensing facilities which dispense 10,000 gallons per month (gpm) or more. Further discussion of the applicability of this regulation, as well as the compliance schedule for Delaware's three counties are outlined in the NPR.       Other specific requirements of the Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR.            Final Action      EPA is approving the SIP revision to add Section 36&hyph;Stage II Vapor Recovery and Appendix J,     Procedures for Implementation of Regulations Covering Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities     to Regulation No. 24, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions'' submitted by the State of Delaware on January 11, 1993.     Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Shapiro, revised these SIP tables so that Table 2 final actions on which no adverse comments were received on the proposed rule may be delegated to Table 3 actions. No comments were received concerning this action, therefore, under the new guidelines this final action may be classified as a Table 3 action. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request.

text:   SUMMARY:     EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision establishes and requires the implementation of an Oxygenated Gasoline Program in three control areas as follows: the Northeast Oxygenated Gasoline Control Area_comprised of Cecil County which is part of the Philadelphia Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA); the Baltimore Oxygenate Gasoline Control Area_comprised of Baltimore City and the counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, Howard, and Queen Anne's, all of which are included in the Baltimore Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA); and the Washington Oxygenated Gasoline Control Area_comprised of the counties of Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Montgomery, and Prince George's, which comprise the Maryland portion of the Washington, DC MSA. The intended effect of this action is to approve these regulations to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act). This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On December 14, 1993, (58 FR 65309), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland. The NPR proposed approval of an Oxygenated Gasoline Program in the State of Maryland. A formal SIP revision was submitted by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992.             Specific requirements of the Oxygenated Gasoline Program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No comments were received on the NPR.        Final Action      EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992, which implements an Oxygenated Gasoline Program in the State. The SIP revision consists of revisions to Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 03.03.05, and COMAR 26.11.13 and new regulations codified at COMAR 03.03.06 and COMAR 26.11.20. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.    This action was originally classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the     Federal Register     on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). However, in an October 4, 1993 memorandum, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, Michael H. Shapiro, revised these SIP tables so that Table 2 final actions on which no adverse comments were received on the proposed rule may be delegated to Table 3 actions. No comments were received concerning this action; therefore, under the new guidelines, this final action may be classified as a Table 3 action. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.       Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve Maryland's Oxygenated Gasoline Program must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action.

This revision establishes and requires the implementation of an Oxygenated Gasoline Program in three control areas as follows: the Northeast Oxygenated Gasoline Control Area_comprised of Cecil County which is part of the Philadelphia Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA); the Baltimore Oxygenate Gasoline Control Area_comprised of Baltimore City and the counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford, Howard, and Queen Anne's, all of which are included in the Baltimore Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA); and the Washington Oxygenated Gasoline Control Area_comprised of the counties of Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Montgomery, and Prince George's, which comprise the Maryland portion of the Washington, DC MSA. The intended effect of this action is to approve these regulations to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act). This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.           </SUMMARY> <DATE>  EFFECTIVE DATE:     This final rule will become effective on July 11, 1994.           </DATE> <ADDRESS>  ADDRESSES:     Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; Air and Radiation Docket (6102), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and the Maryland Department of the Environment, 2500 Broening Highway, Baltimore, Maryland 21224.            </ADDRESS>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Catherine L. Magliocchetti, (215) 597&hyph;6863 at the EPA address indicated in the     Addresses     section.           <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On December 14, 1993, (58 FR 65309), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland. The NPR proposed approval of an Oxygenated Gasoline Program in the State of Maryland. A formal SIP revision was submitted by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992.             Specific requirements of the Oxygenated Gasoline Program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No comments were received on the NPR.        Final Action      EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992, which implements an Oxygenated Gasoline Program in the State. The SIP revision consists of revisions to Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 03.03.05, and COMAR 26.11.13 and new regulations codified at COMAR 03.03.06 and COMAR 26.11.20. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.    This action was originally classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the     Federal Register     on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). However, in an October 4, 1993 memorandum, the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, Michael H. Shapiro, revised these SIP tables so that Table 2 final actions on which no adverse comments were received on the proposed rule may be delegated to Table 3 actions. No comments were received concerning this action; therefore, under the new guidelines, this final action may be classified as a Table 3 action. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.       Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve Maryland's Oxygenated Gasoline Program must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act.)

text:   SUMMARY:     EPA is amending the regulations related to financial assurance promulgated under Subtitles C and I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Those regulations cite the ``Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,'' published by the International Chamber of Commerce. This notice inserts the words ``and copyrighted'' into the letter of credit instrument to clarify that the International Chamber of Commerce publication is copyrighted material. As a result of this notice, owners and operators using the letter of credit instrument to demonstrate financial assurance must include this additional language.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   I. Authority       This amendment is promulgated under the authority of Sections 2002(a), 3004, 3005, and 3006 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6912, 6924, 6925, 6926, and 6991, and under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.         II. Background       Owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must demonstrate financial assurance for costs of closure, post-closure care, third-party liability and corrective action associated with their facilities. In subpart H of 40 CFR part 264, the Agency has established regulations regarding financial assurance for closure, post-closure care, and third party liability. Section 264.151 provides wording for the various financial instruments that owners and operators may use to demonstrate financial assurance. Section 264.151(d) provides wording for a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance for closure and post-closure care, and &sect;264.151(k) provides wording for a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance for third-party liability.     The RCRA regulations in 40 CFR part 280 impose similar requirements on owners and operators of underground storage tanks. Under those provisions, owners and operators of underground storage tanks must demonstrate financial assurance for taking corrective action and for third party liability. The regulations then establish a series of mechanisms that owners and operators can use. Section 280.99 provides the wording for a letter of credit, which is one of those allowable mechanisms.     Finally, the regulations at 40 CFR part 144, subpart F for the Underground Injection Control Program contain specific requirements for financial responsibility for Class I hazardous waste injection wells. Class I wells inject industrial and municipal wastes, including RCRA hazardous wastes, below the lowermost underground source of drinking water (USDW). 40 CFR part 144, subpart F, is directly applicable to owners and operators of all Class I hazardous waste injection wells.       III. Purpose of This Notice       The wording of the letter of credit instrument in &sect;&sect;144.70(d), 264.151 (d) and (k), and &sect;280.99 includes a reference to the ``Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits,'' published by the International Chamber of Commerce. However, the language does not make it clear that the International Chamber of Commerce publication is copyrighted material.     This correction notice amends the letter of credit instrument in &sect;&sect;144.70(d), 264.151 (d) and (k), and 280.99 to clarify that the International Chamber of Commerce publication is copyrighted material by including the words ``and copyrighted'' in the wording of the letter of credit instrument. As a result of this change to the regulations, owners and operators who obtain a letter of credit to demonstrate financial assurance must use the revised language in &sect;264.151(d), 264.151(k), or 280.99(b), which includes the words ``and copyrighted.''         IV. Effect on State Authority To Administer Federal Programs       Since this amendment only revises the description of the document, and does not impose new duties on owners or operators that choose to rely on letters of credit, EPA will not require states to adopt this change as part of their approved UIC and UST programs or authorized RCRA programs. Therefore, owners and operators in authorized states that do not adopt this change will not be affected by this rule. However, EPA encourages states to adopt this change.     In states that adopt this change and in states without approved UIC or UST programs or states not authorized for the RCRA program, new letter of credit instruments will have to include this new language.         V. Administrative Procedures Act Requirements       Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), a rule is exempt from notice and public comment requirements ``when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefore in the rules issues) that notice and public procedures thereon are impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' EPA believes that comment is unnecessary because this amendment makes only a change in the wording of the letter of credit instrument, but does not change the requirements for using the letter of credit instrument to demonstrate financial assurance. Therefore, EPA believes there is good cause to make today's rule effective on August 9, 1994.

text:   SUMMARY:     This document amends the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (NFS) to reflect a number of miscellaneous changes dealing with NASA internal or administrative matters, such as redesignation of NASA offices and delegation of authority within NASA.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:      Availability of NASA FAR Supplement        The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this rule is a part, is available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, telephone number (202) 783&hyph;3238. Cite GPO Subscription Stock Number 933&hyph;003&hyph;00000&hyph;1. It is not distributed to the public, either in whole or in part, directly by NASA.        Dryden Flight Research Center and Space Station Program Office        The following sections are changed as a result of the establishment of the Dryden Flight Research Center and Space Station Program Office: 1802.101, 1804.7102&hyph;4(a), 1804.7103&hyph;2, 1805.207, 1805.303&hyph;71(b)(1), 1807.7102(b), 1815.807&hyph;71, 1822.103&hyph;4, 1839.7003&hyph;5, and 1852.103.        Waiver of Certified Cost and Price Data for Canadian Commercial Corporation        An existing waiver in 1815.804 is extended. Subparagraph 1815.804&hyph;3(e)(4) is removed. It required NASA personnel to report use of the waiver to NASA Headquarters.        Delegation of Authority for Small Foreign Purchases        Changes to 1825.7003 and 1825.7004 delegate authority and describe internal procedures within NASA.        Reversion of Domestic Preference to Buy American Act        Subpart 1825.71 and clauses at 1852.225&hyph;74 and 1852.225&hyph;75 are removed because an appropriation act requirement for domestic preference was not extended beyond Fiscal Year 1991 funding. The domestic preference required by the Buy American Act, as implemented in (FAR) 48 CFR Subparts 25.1 and 25.2 and (NASA FAR Supplement) 48 CFR Subparts 1825.1 and 1825.2, remains in effect.        Additional Changes        Section 1815.805&hyph;5(b) is revised in order to complete an incomplete sentence. Section 1815.970&hyph;3(b) is revised in order to correct a cross-reference. A reference is corrected in 1822.870 regarding contractor EEO reports. A reference to Code FO is changed to Code UO and the division title is changed (section 1823.7002(c)). Section 1852.209&hyph;71 is revised in order to correct two cross-references. In addition, section references and subpart headings are revised to reflect corresponding changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Dryden Flight Research Center and Space Station Program Office        The following sections are changed as a result of the establishment of the Dryden Flight Research Center and Space Station Program Office: 1802.101, 1804.7102&hyph;4(a), 1804.7103&hyph;2, 1805.207, 1805.303&hyph;71(b)(1), 1807.7102(b), 1815.807&hyph;71, 1822.103&hyph;4, 1839.7003&hyph;5, and 1852.103.        Waiver of Certified Cost and Price Data for Canadian Commercial Corporation        An existing waiver in 1815.804 is extended. Subparagraph 1815.804&hyph;3(e)(4) is removed. It required NASA personnel to report use of the waiver to NASA Headquarters.        Delegation of Authority for Small Foreign Purchases        Changes to 1825.7003 and 1825.7004 delegate authority and describe internal procedures within NASA.        Reversion of Domestic Preference to Buy American Act        Subpart 1825.71 and clauses at 1852.225&hyph;74 and 1852.225&hyph;75 are removed because an appropriation act requirement for domestic preference was not extended beyond Fiscal Year 1991 funding. The domestic preference required by the Buy American Act, as implemented in (FAR) 48 CFR Subparts 25.1 and 25.2 and (NASA FAR Supplement) 48 CFR Subparts 1825.1 and 1825.2, remains in effect.        Additional Changes        Section 1815.805&hyph;5(b) is revised in order to complete an incomplete sentence. Section 1815.970&hyph;3(b) is revised in order to correct a cross-reference. A reference is corrected in 1822.870 regarding contractor EEO reports. A reference to Code FO is changed to Code UO and the division title is changed (section 1823.7002(c)). Section 1852.209&hyph;71 is revised in order to correct two cross-references. In addition, section references and subpart headings are revised to reflect corresponding changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

text:   SUMMARY:     This rule sets forth the policies for using performance-based contracting techniques and addressing this issue as an item in procurement plans.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           Background      The regulation was developed to implement OMB's request that NASA make greater use of performance-based contracting techniques. It holds requiring activities responsible for stating specifications, purchase descriptions, and statements of work, on the basis of performance, where practical, so that a variety of products or services may apply. The regulation also ensures that contract files include a statement on consideration or use of performance-based contracting techniques.        Availability of NASA FAR Supplement        The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this regulation will become a part, is codified in 48 CFR, Chapter 18, and is available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. Cite GPO Subscription Stock Number 933-003&hyph;00000&hyph;1. It is not distributed to the public, whether in whole or in part, directly by NASA.        Executive Order 12866        The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This regulation is needed because greater use of performance-based contracting techniques will give contractors more freedom to innovate and economize, and also hold them more accountable for the end results. The regulation meets that need by requiring performance-based specifications, purchase descriptions and statements of work, where feasible, to (i) describe the work in terms of the required output; (ii) place full responsibility for quality performance on contractors with formal, measurable performance standards and surveillance plans used to assess contractor performance; and (iii) avoid relying on cumbersome and intrusive process-oriented inspection and oversight programs to assess contractor performance.        The potential costs and benefits of the regulatory action are supported by OFPP Policy Letter 91&hyph;2, Service Contracting. The regulation is NASA's internal implementation of OFPP Policy Letter 91&hyph;2. NASA has benefited using performance-oriented launch service contracts that balance the assignment of positive and negative performance incentives with a meaningful system of financial rewards and penalties. The statements of work are broad in scope and general in nature, focusing on the successful delivery of the undamaged and operational spacecraft to the proper trajectory and orbital conditions without violating mission parameters. Some of these contracts provide for (i) mission success pools that incentivize the contractor to deliver payload safely and into correct orbit and (ii) liquidated damages relative to timely and effective performance.                  48 CFR Parts 1807 and 1810        <RINDOCK>RIN 2700&hyph;AB54</RINDOCK>        Acquisition Regulation; Addition of Coverage to the NASA FAR Supplement on Performance-Based Contracting       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This rule sets forth the policies for using performance-based contracting techniques and addressing this issue as an item in procurement plans.           </SUMMARY> <DATE>  EFFECTIVE DATE:     June 30, 1994.           </DATE>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:        Dave Beck, Telephone: (202) 358&hyph;0482.        <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           Background      The regulation was developed to implement OMB's request that NASA make greater use of performance-based contracting techniques.

text:   SUMMARY:     NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Central Aleutian District of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the total allowable catch (TAC) of Atka mackerel specified for this District.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.       In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Atka mackerel TAC for the Central Aleutian District was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish for the BSAI (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 37,846 metric tons (mt).   The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(8), that the Atka mackerel TAC specified for the Central Aleutian District soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 37,346 mt after determining that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the Central Aleutian District. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Central Aleutian District, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

Changes to the applicable tax law were made by section 5031 of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. These regulations will provide the public with the guidance needed to comply with the Act.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:      Paperwork Reduction Act      The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545&hyph;1343. The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 30 minutes to one hour, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 45 minutes.  Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503.      Background      On November 2, 1992, the IRS published in the     Federal Register     proposed amendments to the income tax regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 170, 642, 664, and 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), and to the estate and gift tax regulations (26 CFR part 20 and part 25) under sections 2031, 2512, and 7520 of the Code. Conforming changes were proposed for regulations under other sections of the Code. On February 3, 1993, the IRS published in the     Federal Register     certain corrections to the proposed regulations. This project finalizes those amendments. Written comments responding to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking were received. No public hearing was requested, and none was held. After consideration of all of the comments received regarding the proposed regulations, those amendments are adopted by this Treasury decision with revisions in response to those comments. A summary of the principal comments received and revisions made in the final regulations in response to those comments is provided below.      Explanation of Provisions      The notice of proposed rulemaking included estate tax regulations that described the implementation of the new valuation standard, including an explanation of the general effective date of May 1, 1989 (&sect;20.7520&hyph;1), an explanation of the special elections for charitable interests (&sect;20.7520&hyph;2), a listing of Code provisions that are not subject to section 7520 (&sect;20.7520&hyph;3), and a description of transitional rules for income, estate, and gift tax valuations (&sect;20.7520&hyph;4).

text: nullnull      In response to comments, several editorial changes were made to clarify certain of the formulas contained in the proposed regulations. These clarifications principally involve the insertion of additional parentheses or brackets in order to make the formulas easier for the reader to understand and apply.  Also in response to comments, &sect;1.170A&hyph;12(b) was updated in a correction to the proposed regulations that was published in the     Federal Register     on February 3, 1993. The update includes a formula for the computation of the special factor to value a remainder interest following one life where the property is subject to exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence. A similar formula in &sect;1.170A&hyph;12(e), which is applicable to the valuation of a remainder interest following two lives, was also updated. The change in formulas avoids the need to include lengthy commutation factor tables in the regulations.  Clarifying amendments have been made in the final regulations concerning the meaning of ``valuation date'' for purposes of an election to value a transfer to a charitable remainder trust. In the case of an election under section 7520 to compute the present value of the charitable interest by use of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the transfer is made, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. Sections 1.664&hyph;2(c) and 1.664&hyph;4(e)(4) of the final regulations have been revised accordingly.  Comments were received pertaining to the rule in the proposed regulations under section 7520 concerning the transfer of more than one partial interest in the same property at different times. In response to these comments, the regulations have been amended to make it clear that, generally, each separate transfer is valued with the interest rate applicable in the month of the transfer.  The proposed regulations provide for making the election to use a prior month's interest rate in the case of a transfer to charity. Comments questioned the need for requiring the filing of detailed information as part of a prior-month election. This information is already required to be filed with the tax return for certain situations involving charitable interests that are subject to measuring lives. See, for example, &sect;20.2055&hyph;2(f)(5). This requirement is now explained in the regulations under section 7520. Comments also raised a question about the revocability of the election and the time for making the election. The final regulations provide that the taxpayer makes the prior-month election by so stating on the return and identifying the elected month. The failure to include with the return other information that is required to describe the transfer, whether or not the election is made, will ordinarily not invalidate the election. For elections made on or before June 10, 1994, a reasonable attempt to make the election and submit the required information will be treated as a valid election. The final regulations also provide that the election is generally made on a timely filed tax return for the year of the transfer. However, the election may also be made or changed on an amended or supplemented return that is made within 24 months after the original return is filed.  Comments were received concerning whether the five percent de minimis test (i.e., a transfer to charity of at least five percent of the value of the interest) set forth in the proposed regulations should be applied in determining if the taxpayer may elect to use an alternative prior month interest rate. The final regulations delete this de minimis test.  Comments were received concerning the application of these regulations in situations where an individual is expected to die prematurely or where two individuals die simultaneously. See, for example, Rev. Rul. 80&hyph;80, 1980&hyph;1 C.B. 194, which holds that, in cases where the individual's death is imminent, the standard actuarial tables prescribed by the regulations are not to be used. See, also,     Carter     v.     United States,     291 F.2d 63 (5th Cir. 1991), where the court refused to ascribe value to an income interest for purposes of the section 2013 credit where the death of the transferee was simultaneous with the death of the transferor. Comments were also received concerning the scope of these regulations in light of     O'Reilly     v.     Commissioner,     973 F.2d 1403 (8th. Cir. 1992),     rem'd,     T.C.M. 1994&hyph;61. In     O'Reilly,     the Circuit Court held that the standard actuarial tables were not applicable to a situation in which the application of those tables would have produced an unreasonable result. In that case, the property held in trust produced an extraordinarily low rate of return. A similar result was reached by the Tax Court in     Froh     v.     Commissioner,     100 T.C. 1 (1993), dealing with depletable property. Consistent with these comments, the Service and Treasury are contemporaneously proposing an amendment to these regulations that defines the circumstances in which the section 7520 tables would not apply in valuing a transferred interest. That Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published elsewhere in this issue of the     Federal Register    .

text: nullnull      Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700, announced a method for determining the deemed yearly rate of return for new pooled income funds. This method defined the deemed rate as the highest annual average section 7520 interest rate for the preceding three years, reduced by one percentage point. The proposed regulations would have defined the deemed rate as the highest annual average section 7520 interest rate for the preceding three years, multiplied by 90 percent. Both methods produced the same result for each of the years after the enactment of section 7520:       <TABLE>       &blank;    1First year of pooled income fund    15/1/89 to   12/31/89    11990    11991    11992    11993    11994            Notice 89&hyph;60 method   9.4   9.8   9.8   9.8   9.4   8.4  Proposed regulation method   9.4   9.8   9.8   9.8   9.4   8.4     </TABLE>         Commentators have indicated a strong preference for the method announced in Notice 89&hyph;60, because they view the computation as simpler than that set forth in the proposed regulations. In response to these comments, the final regulations adopt the method described in Notice 89&hyph;60 for determining the deemed yearly rate of return for new pooled income funds.    Comments were received concerning whether, in valuing transfers to a new pooled income fund, the same deemed rate of return would be used throughout the entire three-year period. The final regulations provide that the deemed rate of return for transfers to a new pooled income fund is recomputed each calendar year using the monthly section 7520 rates for the three-year period immediately preceding the calendar year in which each transfer to the fund is made until the fund has been in existence for three taxable years and can compute its highest rate of return for the three taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made.    A commentator suggested that, with respect to the interpolation method for valuing transfers to pooled income funds and charitable remainder unitrusts, a taxpayer be permitted to elect a more exact method of computing the appropriate interest rate. The method prescribed in the proposed regulations has been in use for many years and is prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8&hyph;89) and Internal Revenue Service Publication 1458, ``Actuarial Values, Beta Volume,'' (8&hyph;89). The IRS and Treasury believe that any change from the method prescribed in these publications, which are in current use, would create undue confusion for taxpayers. Consequently, the commentator's suggested change is not being adopted at this time.    Comments were received inquiring about the application of section 7520 to the valuation of annuities issued by certain organizations other than insurance companies. In response to these comments, the final regulations explain that the section 7520 tables are to be used in valuing these annuities. This is an application of the principle adopted in Rev. Rul. 84&hyph;162, 1984&hyph;2 C.B. 200, for transfers after November 23, 1984. A different method of valuation continues to apply for purposes of computing the exclusion ratio in reporting the annuity payments under section 72. These clarifications have been made by updating &sect;1.101&hyph;2(e)(1)(iii)(    b    ) and     Example 8     of &sect;1.1011&hyph;2(c).  Comments were received concerning the presumption in the proposed regulations under section 664 that, if a governing instrument for a charitable remainder unitrust does not prescribe when the distribution is made during the period, the distribution is presumed to be made on the first day of the period. Unitrusts have traditionally been regarded as providing for distributions at the beginning of each period unless the governing instrument provides to the contrary. This presumption has been reflected in unitrust factors prescribed in the regulations under section 664 since the enactment of that section. Therefore, the presumption that distributions are made on the first day of the period, if not otherwise provided for in the instrument, is continued in the final regulations.

text: nullnull      Effective Dates        These regulations are generally effective in the case of annuities, interests for life or terms of years, and remainder or reversionary interests created after April 30, 1989. The regulations provide certain transitional rules intended to alleviate any adverse consequences resulting from the statutory amendments. Several principal provisions of the regulations were announced in Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660 (which announced the change from the 10 percent fixed rate of interest to the section 7520 floating rate of interest), and Notice 89&hyph;60 (which announced the change in mortality tables) (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(    b    ) of the Statement of Procedural Rules). A transitional rule in the final regulations provides that, for valuation dates of transfers after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24 or Notice 89&hyph;60 in valuing the transferred interest. For gift tax purposes, a transitional rule in the final regulations provides that if, after December 31, 1988, but before May 1, 1989, a donor transferred an interest in property, retaining an interest in the same property, and the donor later transferred the retained interest in the property after April 30, 1989, and before January 1, 1990, the donor may elect to value the transfer of the retained interest under either the 10 percent tables or the section 7520 tables (whichever is more beneficial). For estate tax purposes, a transitional rule in the final regulations provides that the estate of a mentally incompetent decedent may elect to value the property interest included in the gross estate under the mortality table and interest rate in effect at the time the decedent became mentally incompetent or the mortality table and interest rate in effect on the decedent's date of death if the decedent was under a mental incapacity that existed on May 1, 1989, and continued uninterrupted until the decedent's death. For purposes of determining the value of the remainder interest in a testamentary charitable remainder unitrust or annuity trust, a transitional rule in the final regulations provides that the mortality table and 10 percent interest rate in effect before May 1, 1989, or the mortality table and interest rate under section 7520 may be used if the decedent was mentally incompetent on May 1, 1989, and (1) such incompetency continued uninterrupted until death, or (2) the decedent died within 90 days of first regaining competency after April 30, 1989.        Special Analyses        It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.        Drafting Information        The principal author of these regulations is William L. Blodgett, Office of Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

text:   SUMMARY:     We are advising the public that four applications for permits to release genetically engineered organisms into the environment are being reviewed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The applications have been submitted in accordance with 7 CFR part 340, which regulates the introduction of certain genetically engineered organisms and products.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' require a person to obtain a permit before introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article.

headline: Inadequate Demand for Official Services in Wyoming
text:   SUMMARY:     FGIS has determined there is inadequate demand for official services to designate any organization to provide official services in the State of Wyoming.                 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:        This action has been reviewed and determined not to be a rule or regulation as defined in Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1; therefore, the Executive Order and Departmental Regulation do not apply to this action.    In the September 30, 1993,     Federal Register     (58 FR 51047), FGIS announced that the designation of Wyoming ends on March 31, 1994, and asked persons interested in providing official services in the geographic area assigned to Wyoming to submit an application for designation. Applications were due by October 29, 1993. Wyoming applied for designation in the entire area currently assigned to it. FGIS requested comments on the applicant in the December 1, 1993,     Federal Register     (58 FR 63331). Comments were due by December 31, 1993. FGIS received no comments by the deadline.    FGIS then contacted the major applicants for grain inspection services in the Wyoming area and determined that, pursuant to the provisions of the Act, there is an insufficient need for official services to designate an official agency. Therefore, FGIS is not designating an official agency to provide services in the area currently assigned to Wyoming. Any firms which may require official inspection services after March 31, 1994, should contact FGIS' Wichita Office at 316&hyph;269&hyph;7171 (FAX: 316&hyph;269&hyph;6163).

Whereas, in 1992, the Board of Harbor Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans, grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 2, was authorized temporary subzone status by the Foreign-Trade Zones Board for the Equitable Shipyards facility in New Orleans, Louisiana (Subzone 2G) (for a period ending April 1, 1994) (Board Order 573, 57 FR 13695, 4&hyph;17&hyph;92; Board Order 635, 58 FR 25606, 4&hyph;27&hyph;93);   Whereas, in 1993, further application was made by the Board of Commissioners for an indefinite extension of said subzone status (FTZ Docket 2&hyph;93, 1&hyph;21&hyph;93;     Federal Register     notice invited public comment, 58 FR 7528, 2&hyph;8&hyph;93); and,   Whereas, upon review, the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations would be satisfied, and that approval of the application for the indefinite extension of subzone status would be in the public interest if approval were given subject to the standard shipyard restriction on foreign steel mill products now in effect for the facility;   Now, therefore, the Board hereby approves the application for extension of subzone status, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations, including &sect;400.28, and subject to the following special conditions:          1. Any foreign steel mill products admitted to the subzone, including plate, angles, shapes, channels, rolled steel stock, bars, pipes and tubes, not incorporated into merchandise otherwise classified, and which is used in manufacturing, shall be subject to Customs duties in accordance with applicable law, if the same item is then being produced by a domestic steel mill; and,   2. In addition to the annual report, Trinity Marine Group shall advise the Board's Executive Secretary (&sect;400.28(a)(3)) as to significant new contracts with appropriate information concerning foreign purchases otherwise dutiable, so that the Board may consider whether any foreign dutiable items are being imported for manufacturing in the subzone primarily because of subzone status and whether the Board should consider requiring Customs duties to be paid on such items.

For antidumping reviews, the interested party must specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a review, and the requesting party must state why the person desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin, and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.    Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International Trade Administration, room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. The Department also asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: John Kugelman, in room 3065 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with &sect;353.31(g) or &sect;355.31(g) of the Commerce Regulations, a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list.

headline: Large Power Transformers From Italy; Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review 
text:   SUMMARY:     In response to a request by the petitioner, the Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping finding on large power transformers from Italy. The review covers exports of one manufacturer of this merchandise to the United States during the period from June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. As a result of the review, the Department has preliminarily determined that no dumping margins exist for the respondent. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Background         On June 7, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 31941). The petitioner requested this administrative review on June 28, 1993. We initiated the review on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007), covering the period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).         Scope of the Review         Imports covered by the review are shipments of large power transformers (LPTs); that is, all types of transformers rated 10,000 kVA (kilovolt-amperes) or above, by whatever name designated, used in the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power. The term ``transformers'' includes, but is not limited to, shunt reactors, autotransformers, rectifier transformers, and power rectifier transformers. Not included are combination units, commonly known as rectiformers, if the entire integrated assembly is imported in the same shipment and entered on the same entry and the assembly has been ordered and invoiced as a unit, without a separate price for the transformer portion of the assembly. This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 8504.22.00, 8504.23.00, 8504.34.33, 8504.40.00, and 8504.50.00. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.     The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of transformers, Tamini Costruzioni Elettromeccaniche (Tamini), during the period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993.         United States Price         In calculating U.S. price (USP), the Department used purchase price as defined in section 772(b) of the Tariff Act. We calculated purchase price based on the packed price to the U.S. customer. We made adjustments to USP for transportation expenses to the Italian port and duty drawback.         Foreign Market Value         For the purposes of the preliminary results, we determined that, due to the highly customized nature of the products under review, the LPTs sold in the United States could not reasonably be compared to any other LPTs sold by Tamini. Therefore, in accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, we calculated foreign market value based on constructed value of the model sold in the United States.     In accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act, the constructed value includes the costs of materials and fabrication, general expenses, profit, and packing for shipment to the United States. Home market selling expenses were used pursuant to section 773(e)(1)(B) of the Tariff Act. Since the profit submitted by Tamini exceeded the statutory eight percent profit, we applied the submitted profit to the cost of production.                <RINDOCK>[A&hyph;475&hyph;031]</RINDOCK>                 <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     International Trade Administration/Import   Administration, Commerce.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty   administrative review.               </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     In response to a request by the petitioner, the Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping finding on large power transformers from Italy.

Since commissions were granted only in the home market, we offset the commission adjustment by adding U.S. indirect selling expenses to the constructed value.         Preliminary Results of Review         As a result of our comparison of United States price to foreign market value, we preliminarily determine that a weighted-average margin of zero percent exists for sales of LPTs made to the United States by Tamini during the period June 1, 1992 through   May 31, 1993.     Parties to this proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of publication of this notice and may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication or the first business day thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in those comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice. Service of all briefs and written comments shall be in accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(e). The Department will publish the final results of the administrative review, including the results of its analysis of any such comments or hearing.     The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion of this review.     Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act:    (1) The cash deposit rate for Tamini will be the rate established in the final results of this administrative review;    (2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period;    (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise.

text: nullnull      The cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 92.47 percent. On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT) in     Floral Trade Council     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and     Federal-Mogul Corporation     v.     United States,     Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders as the ``all others'' rate for cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative review published by the Department (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews.     Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding, and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate of 92.47 percent established in the first final results published by the Department in the     Federal Register     on August 6, 1984, (49 FR 31313).     These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.     This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.     This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22(c)(5).

headline: Titanium Sponge From Kazakhstan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review 
text:   SUMMARY:     On February 11, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of review of the antidumping duty finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan (59 FR 6618). The review covers exports of the subject merchandise to the United States from Kazakhstan during the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993.         We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. Based on our analysis of comments received, the final results remain unchanged from the preliminary results.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background         On August 28, 1968, the Department of the Treasury published an antidumping finding on titanium sponge from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (33 FR 12138). In December 1991, the USSR divided into fifteen independent states. To conform to these changes, the Department changed the original antidumping finding into fifteen findings applicable to the Baltic states and the former USSR (57 FR 36070, August 12, 1992).     On August 30, 1993, the Department received a request to conduct an administrative review of the antidumping finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan. The Department initiated the review on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51053), covering the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. On February 11, 1994, we published the preliminary results of review of the antidumping finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan (59 FR 6618). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).         Scope of the Review         The merchandise covered by this review is all imports of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan. Titanium sponge is chiefly used for aerospace vehicles, specifically, in the construction of compressor blades and wheels, stator blades, rotors, and other parts in aircraft gas turbine engines.     Imports of titanium sponge are currently classifiable under the harmonized tariff schedule (HTS) subheading 8108.10.50.10. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes; our written description of the scope of this finding is dispositive.         Analysis of Comments Received         We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from Titanium Metals Corporation (TIMET), a domestic producer of titanium sponge, and rebuttal comments from RMI Titanium Co. (RMI), an importer of titanium sponge.         Comment 1:     TIMET argues that there were imports of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan, under temporary importation bond (TIB), during the period of review. TIMET cites a December 3, 1993, letter from RMI to the Acting Assistant Secretary to support this statement. TIMET asserts that such imports are processed into titanium mill products and re-exported. TIMET states antidumping duties should be assessed on imports entered under TIB because such imports result in the circumvention of the antidumping finding. TIMET cites U.S. Customs Service Headquarter's rulings to argue that Customs has treated TIB entries of other products as consumption entries in order to prevent circumvention of quota laws.                  <RINDOCK>[A&hyph;834&hyph;803] </RINDOCK>                 <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     International Trade Administration/Import Administration/Commerce.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     On February 11, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of review of the antidumping duty finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan (59 FR 6618).

Based on our analysis of comments received, the final results remain unchanged from the preliminary results.         </SUMMARY> <DATE>  EFFECTIVE DATE:     April 7, 1994.         </DATE>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     David Genovese, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5254.         <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background         On August 28, 1968, the Department of the Treasury published an antidumping finding on titanium sponge from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (33 FR 12138). In December 1991, the USSR divided into fifteen independent states. To conform to these changes, the Department changed the original antidumping finding into fifteen findings applicable to the Baltic states and the former USSR (57 FR 36070, August 12, 1992).     On August 30, 1993, the Department received a request to conduct an administrative review of the antidumping finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan. The Department initiated the review on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51053), covering the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993. On February 11, 1994, we published the preliminary results of review of the antidumping finding on titanium sponge from Kazakhstan (59 FR 6618). The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).         Scope of the Review         The merchandise covered by this review is all imports of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan. Titanium sponge is chiefly used for aerospace vehicles, specifically, in the construction of compressor blades and wheels, stator blades, rotors, and other parts in aircraft gas turbine engines.     Imports of titanium sponge are currently classifiable under the harmonized tariff schedule (HTS) subheading 8108.10.50.10. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes; our written description of the scope of this finding is dispositive.         Analysis of Comments Received         We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from Titanium Metals Corporation (TIMET), a domestic producer of titanium sponge, and rebuttal comments from RMI Titanium Co. (RMI), an importer of titanium sponge.         Comment 1:     TIMET argues that there were imports of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan, under temporary importation bond (TIB), during the period of review. TIMET cites a December 3, 1993, letter from RMI to the Acting Assistant Secretary to support this statement. TIMET asserts that such imports are processed into titanium mill products and re-exported. TIMET states antidumping duties should be assessed on imports entered under TIB because such imports result in the circumvention of the antidumping finding. TIMET cites U.S. Customs Service Headquarter's rulings to argue that Customs has treated TIB entries of other products as consumption entries in order to prevent circumvention of quota laws.       </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull          Department's Position:     We disagree with TIMET. Consistent with the Kazakh Government's questionnaire response, our analysis of Census data reveals that no shipments of titanium sponge have entered the United States from Kazakhstan during the period of review. While TIMET provided public information on imports of titanium sponge from Russia and Ukraine in those ongoing administrative reviews, it provided no information on shipments in this case. Absent evidence to the contrary, we conclude that there were no imports, including imports under TIB procedures, of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan during the review period.       Final Results of Review       Based on our analysis of the comments received we have not changed the final results from those presented in the preliminary results of review.   The following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of these final results of review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: the cash deposit rate for entries of titanium sponge from Kazakhstan will be 83.96 percent.   These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.   This notice also serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.   This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation.   This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.           Dated: March 31, 1994.       <SIGNER>  Susan G.

headline: Price Determination; Uranium From Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan
text:   SUMMARY:     Pursuant to section IV.C.1. of the antidumping suspension agreements on uranium from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, the Department calculated an observed market price for uranium of $11.37/lb. On the basis of this price, the export quota from uranium pursuant to Section IV.A. of each of the agreements is zero. Exports pursuant to other provisions of the agreements are not affected by this price.           null           <RINDOCK>[A&hyph;100&hyph;002]</RINDOCK>                 <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     International Trade Administration, Import Administration, Commerce.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     Pursuant to section IV.C.1. of the antidumping suspension agreements on uranium from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, the Department calculated an observed market price for uranium of $11.37/lb. On the basis of this price, the export quota from uranium pursuant to Section IV.A. of each of the agreements is zero. Exports pursuant to other provisions of the agreements are not affected by this price.           </SUMMARY> <DATE>  EFFECTIVE DATE:     April 1, 1994.           </DATE>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:        Melissa Skinner or Beth Chalecki, Office of Agreements Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street &amp; Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0159 or (202) 482&hyph;2312.      Price Calculation      Background            Section IV.C.1. of each agreement specifies that the Department will issue the DOC observed market price on April 1, 1994, and use it to determine the quota applicable to imports from the various republics during the period April 1, 1994 to September 30, 1994.      Calculation Summary        Section IV.C.1. of each agreement specifies how the components of the market price are reached. In order to determine the spot market price, the Department utilized the monthly average of the Uranium Price Information System Spot Price Indicator (UPIS SPI) and the weekly average of the Uranium Exchange Spot Price (Ux Spot). In order to determine the long-term market price, the Department utilized the weighted average long-term price as determined by the Department on the basis of information provided by market participants and a simple average of the UPIS Base Price for the months in which there were new contracts reported.    Our letters to market participants provided a contract summary sheet and directions requesting the submitter to report his/her best estimate of the future price of merchandise to be delivered in accordance with the contract delivery schedules (in U.S. dollars per pound U    3    O    8     equivalent). Using the information reported in the proprietary summary sheets, the Department calculated the present value of the prices reported for any future deliveries assuming an annual inflation rate of 4.2 percent, which was derived from a rolling average of the annual GNP Implicit Price Deflator index from the past four years. The Department used the base quantities reported on the summary sheet for the purpose of weight-averaging the prices of the long-term contracts submitted by market participants. We then calculated a simple average of the UPIS Base Price and the long-term price determined by the Department.

text: nullnull      Weighting          As in previous price determinations, the Department used the average spot and long-term volumes of U.S. utility and domestic supplier purchases, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), to weight the spot and long-term components of the observed price. However, with the publication of EIA's 1992 Uranium Industry Annual, we have used purchase data from the period of 1989&hyph;1992, rather than 1988&hyph;1991. During this period, the spot market accounted for 31.39 percent of total purchases, and the long-term market for 68.61 percent.        Calculation Announcement          The Department determined, using the methodology and information described above, that the observed market price is $11.37. This reflects an average spot market price of $9.91, weighted at 31.39 percent, and an average long-term contract price of $12.04, weighted at 68.61 percent. Since this price is below the $13.00/lb. minimum expressed in Appendix A of the agreements, there will be no quota under Section IV.A. of the agreements available to any signatory republic for the period April 1, 1994 to September 30, 1994.        Comments          Consistent with the Department's letters of interpretation dated February 22, 1993, we provide interested parties our preliminary price determination on March 10, 1994. We received no comments.      Allowing for additional information received since March 10, we have determined that the observed market price for uranium is $11.37/lb. The Department invites parties to provide pricing information for use in the next price determination. Any such information should be provided for the record and should be submitted by September 5, 1994.              Dated: April 1, 1994.       <SIGNER>  Paul L.

headline: Prospective Grant of Co-Exclusive Patent Licenses
text: nullnull           <USBUREAU>National Technical Information Service</USBUREAU>     <DOCTITLE>Prospective Grant of Co-Exclusive Patent Licenses</DOCTITLE>        This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, is contemplating the issuance of grant co-exclusive licenses in the United States to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent No. 4,616,316 (Serial No. 6-458,312), titled ``Medication Compliance Monitoring Device Having Conductive Traces upon a Frangible Backing of a Medication Compartment,'' to Medical MicroSystems, Inc., having a place of business in Clarkson Valley, Missouri, and Medical Technology Systems, Inc., having a place of business in Clearwater, Florida. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America.    The prospective co-exclusive licenses will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective co-exclusive licenses may be granted unless, within sixty days from the date of this published Notice, NTIS receives written evidence and argument which establish that the grant of the licenses would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.    The present invention is a medication compliance monitoring system consisting of a blister pack having an array of plastic blisters defining compartments for medication, with a frangible nonconductive backing sheet having conductive traces behind the compartments which are respectively ruptured when the medication doses are removed. The blister pack is detachably connected to an electronic memory circuit via a multi-terminal male connector tab on the backing sheet, wired to the conductive traces, and a corresponding female connector with terminals wired to the electronic memory circuit. The electronic memory circuit addresses each individual trace periodically at a constant time interval over a predetermined extended period of time to determine if it is intact. The electronic memory circuit detects the ruptures and stores the time data thereof over said extended period of time. During the patient's follow-up visit a microcomputer is employed to retrieve the dose-removal-time data from the memory circuit; it processes the data and provides a display of the compliance information. A socket adapter is used to alternately configure the electronic memory circuit for data acquisition and extraction. The socket adapter is in the form of a multiple-pin jumper plug engageable in a multi-contact socket connected to the memory circuit. Insertion of the plug configures the memory circuit for data acquisition. Removal of the plug configures the memory circuit for data retrieval and processing by the microcomputer. In a typical embodiment there are 42 blisters whose associated conductive traces are addressed every 15 minutes over an extended time period which may be as much as 85 days.                The availability of S.N. 6&hyph;458,312 for licensing was published in the     Federal Register     Vol. 48, No. 54, p. 11483 (March 18, 1983).    A copy of the instant patent is available for $3.00 (payable by check or money order) from the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Box 9, Washington, DC 20231.    Inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated license must be submitted to Neil L. Mark, Center for the Utilization of Federal Technology, NTIS, Box 1423, Springfield, VA 22151. Properly filed competing applications received by the NTIS in response to this notice will be considered as objections to the grant of the contemplated license.              <SIGNER>  Douglas J.

text:   SUMMARY:     This notice invites applications for an award of disaster relief tourism promotion financial assistance, and establishes and sets forth application and selection procedures, evaluation criteria, and other requirements.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Notice is hereby given to the States of Florida, Hawaii, and Louisiana and the Territory of Guam, their political subdivisions, and combinations thereof, and to private or public nonprofit organizations and associations that, pursuant to Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;368, a total of $1,400,000 is available from the USTTA under the Disaster Relief Tourism Promotion Financial Assistance Program, to assist projects to promote international tourism to Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Guam. These States'  1   International tourism promotion needs have increased due to Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Iniki or Typhoon Omar. As used in this notice, ``private or public non-profit organization or association'' means an institution, organization, or association, either private or public, which has tax exempt status as defined in section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.            1      As used in this notice, the terms ``State,'' ``States,'' and ``United States'' include the States of Florida, Hawaii, and Louisiana, and the Territory of Guam.          These funds are intended to help defray the costs of increased tourism promotion needs arising from the above specified disasters.    There is no limit to the amount an applicant may request, nor is there a limit to the aggregate financial assistance the specified States or Territory may be provided annually.    The funding instrument will be a grant unless it is anticipated that the USTTA will be substantially involved in the implementation of the project for which an award is to be made, in which case the funding instrument will be a cooperative agreement.        I. Selection Procedures        Only eligible applicants from the four eligible States whose applications receive a final evaluation score of 80 or greater will be considered for funding. No applicant will be awarded funds unless the application includes: (1) Documentation demonstrating that all programs set forth in the application are or will be effectively coordinated with other affected entities in the State; and (2) a marketing plan that contains clearly stated objectives for a time period of one year and procedures for credible evaluation and tracking, and that is integrated (in terms of multiple activities) with a generally cohesive approach. Further, no applicant will be awarded funds unless the projects for which funding is sought are aimed at market(s) which have potential for mitigating the tourism-related negative effects of the disaster. The application must include credible market research to support this potential.    All applications will be reviewed and judged individually, independent from all other applications, by each of four qualified evaluators acting without consultation among themselves. Each evaluator will score each application by awarding points for each of the three (3) evaluation criteria set forth in IV, below. Scores awarded for each evaluation criterion will be multiplied by the weight assigned to that criterion. A maximum score of 100 points may be awarded to an application. Once scores have been determined individually by each evaluator, a final score for each application will be determined by averaging the scores provided by each of the four evaluators.    Awards shall be made based on an equitable geographic distribution and to those applicants whose final evaluation scores are at least 80 or greater, in descending order starting with the applicant whose application has the highest final evaluation score, and subject to the availability of funds. Awards may not necessarily be made to the highest-scored proposals.        II. Matching Requirements        There is no matching requirement.        III. Award Period        The maximum period of time for which financial assistance shall be awarded is one year.        IV. Evaluation Criteria        The three evaluation criteria and the weight assigned each criterion are:           A.     Needs and effect criterion     (assigned weight_0.4)           Application demonstrates the need of affected area and the ability of the project to directly counteract the negative impact of the disaster on tourism.    (1) Application clearly reflects ability of project to offset negative impacts of the disaster which have not been largely mitigated by other aid. (40 points)    (2) Application includes documentation from Federal, State, or local sources demonstrating the current degree of need. This must include documentation showing the: (a) Current loss of visitation and tourism-related employment; (b) level of tourism prior to the disaster; (c) current level of tourism; (d) impact in terms of employment and income of tourism on the area economy versus other industries; and (e) extent to which the negative impact of the disaster on tourism has been mitigated. (60 points)           B.     General criterion     (assigned weight_0.2)           Application clearly states objectives that respond directly to the specialized international tourism promotion needs of the impacted area.    (1) Application states clear and achievable objectives to be carried out over an appropriate length of time. (25 points)    (2) Application demonstrates that project is aimed at international markets that have been identified using credible market research. (25 points)     (3) Application demonstrates that project is fully integrated (in terms of multiple activities) with a generally cohesive approach. (25 points)    (4) Application demonstrates that applicant has the organizational quality and competence to effectively carry out the project. The application must include an organizational chart and a biographical sketch of the program director with the following information: Name, address, phone number, background and other qualifying experience for the project; and a list of other key personnel, consultants, etc. engaged in the project, which includes names, training and background. Applications by non-profit organizations must include a copy of the articles of incorporation, charter, trust statement, or other similar documentation which sets forth the authorizing powers and purposes of the organization, together with bylaws or other code of regulations; a brief description of organizational arrangements for fiscal and managerial control, including the extent to which these overlap or are integrated with other organizations; a copy of a current financial statement of the organization; and a copy of the current Internal Revenue Service tax exemption letter which certifies the organization's not-for-profit status. (25 points)           C.     Project criterion     (assigned weight_0.4)           Each application must include a project or projects from at least two of the five project areas set forth below. The project evaluation component score will be determined by adding the points awarded for each of the applicable project areas set forth below divided by the number of applicable project areas.        1. Media Product Information        Media product information projects are those that include the development of journalist familiarization tours and dissemination of product information on the destination.

U.S.C. 553) including having to give notice and an opportunity for comment do not apply to this notice because the notice relates to grants, benefits, or contracts. Since notice and an opportunity to comment is not required under any other statute, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and was not prepared.     The Department has determined that the Federal assistance covered by this notice will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, no draft or final Environmental Impact Statement has been or will be prepared.     This notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.

headline: Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Middle Wabash River Area, Greenfield Bayou Project in Vigo and Sullivan Counties, IN
text:   SUMMARY:     The U.S. Army Engineer District, Louisville is initiating the preparation of a DEIS for the Middle Wabash River Area, Greenfield Bayou Project in Vigo and Sullivan Counties, Indiana. The proposed action is the partial reconstruction of an existing levee, the construction of additional levee, and the restoration of the fish and wildlife habitat of a significant portion of the previously forstated floodplain. The study area consists of over 12,000 acres of both cropland and bottomland forest.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Five alternative levee alignments were developed during reconnaissance stage study, providing flood protection to a wide range of acreage of agricultural land. Additional alternative levee locations may be investigated during the current feasibility stage study.        The potential effects of the reconstruction of the existing levee, the addition of new levee, and the restoration of areas to offset previous losses of wetlands (including bottomland hardwood forest) will be reviewed in the DEIS. Significant issues to be addressed will include, but not be limited to, terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, terrestrial and aquatic wildlife, surface and ground water resources, geological and crude oil production, soils, agricultural production, local population and residences, and roadways and local travel patterns.  All Federal, state, and local agencies, organized groups, and individuals are invited to participate by providing their concerns in writing to the point of contact. An interagency (Federal, state, and local government agencies) scoping meeting will be held in the near future. No public scoping meeting is planned at this time.  It is estimated that the DEIS will be made available for comment on or about October 1995.               <USBUREAU>Department of the Army</USBUREAU>     <DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Middle Wabash River Area, Greenfield Bayou Project in Vigo and Sullivan Counties, IN</DOCTITLE>       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     U.S. Army Engineer District, Louisville, DOD.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of intent.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The U.S. Army Engineer District, Louisville is initiating the preparation of a DEIS for the Middle Wabash River Area, Greenfield Bayou Project in Vigo and Sullivan Counties, Indiana.

headline: Savannah River Operations Office (SR) Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award a Noncompetitive Grant
text:   SUMMARY:     The DOE announces that it plans to accept an unsolicited proposal and award a grant to South Carolina Research Authority, 5300 International Boulevard, North Charleston, SC 29418. The project entitled, ``The Reclamation and Reduction of Nuclear Residuals Program,'' will be awarded for a six-month period with DOE support of $298,602. Pursuant to Section 10 CFR 600.7(b) and 600.14, eligibility for this award has been limited to South Carolina Research Authority as a result of acceptance of their unsolicited proposal, and DOE has determined that award of a grant is appropriate.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Procurement Request Number:     09&hyph;94SR18422.000.            Project Scope:     The proposed program will involve the performance of an assessment of a concept to manage, in a comprehensive manner, the residues from the use and production of nuclear materials in South Carolina. The proposal includes a phased approach for the assessment, with the first phase assessing the technical, environmental and economic feasibility, benefits and risks regarding the reclamation and reduction of nuclear residues. The result of Phase I will be an assessment that will define a nuclear materials management program that vastly improves the existing means of nuclear material storage, handling and disposal of nuclear materials in South Carolina. The assessment will specifically address the concept that irradiated and contaminated materials be converted into containers that are necessary to hold and store nuclear materials, wastes and by-products. This assessment will further define a Nuclear Materials Management Program centered at the Savannah River Site (SRS) that may improve the situation regarding nuclear material storage and disposal in South Carolina.    South Carolina Research Authority is a not-for-profit, public corporation established by an act of the South Carolina Assembly on April 29, 1983, to enhance the research capabilities of the State's public and private universities, establish a continuing forum to foster greater dialogue throughout the research community within the State, and to promote the development of high technology industry and research facilities in South Carolina. The proposed project is considered meritorious and represents a unique and innovative idea and approach which is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation. Based on documentation presented and appropriate evaluation, it is determined to be in the best interest of DOE to award a grant to South Carolina Research Authority.

headline: Financial Assistance Award: University of Missouri-Rolla 
text:   SUMMARY:     The Department of Energy (DOE), Metairie Site Office, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) it intends to make a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award (Grant) through the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center to the University of Missouri-Rolla.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) has proposed that DOE sponsor a study of Area of Review (AOR) variance possibilities for the East Texas field, with Phase I beginning in April 1994. A further study of other high-priority areas in Texas, Phase II, will be initiated and completed in 1995. It is expected that the Phase I data required for AOR variance consideration will be supplied by the East Texas Salt Water Disposal Company, which operates injection wells for the field on behalf of field owners.         When the Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations were promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1980, existing Class II injection wells were excluded from AOR requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through a Federal Advisory Committee (FAC), has recently recommended that AORs for existing wells (which were not previously subject to that requirement) be performed within five years of promulgation of amended UIC regulations. The FAC has, however, recognized that conditions can exist that make it unnecessary to perform well-by-well AORs and that wells in a basin, producing trend, region or field, or a portion of such areas can be exempted from an AOR through a variance program.     A methodology for identifying areas that would be eligible for variance from AOR requirements based upon the FAC criteria has been developed by a research team in the School of Mines and Metallurgy at the UMR under sponsorship of the American Petroleum Institute (API). The methodology provides for evaluation of an area for variance based upon certain conditions or based upon the manner by which wells in the area were constructed and abandoned. Wells not excluded by variance would be subject to well-by-well AORs. With continuing sponsorship from the American Petroleum Institute, the AOR variance methodology developed at the UMR has been applied to 24 oil fields undergoing injection in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and is currently being applied to injection fields in selected counties of the Permian basin in West Texas. In the San Juan Basin, at least two variance criteria were found to apply to all 24 fields and are believed to provide good possibilities for variances in 20 fields and some possibilities in the remaining four.     The East Texas Field was discovered in 1930 and is the largest oil field in the Lower-48 states. Recovery from the field is expected to ultimately be about 5.6 billion barrels. The AOR, which has a 1/4 mile radius, frequently includes 25 or more wells. Since the field is over 60 years old and many of the wells have been abandoned for a number of years, the abandonment records are sometimes not readily available. More than 30,000 wells have been drilled in the field and less than 8,000 are currently producing. Records on 22,000 abandoned and inactive wells (some of which are over 60 years old) will be hard to locate.     Requirement for complete AORs on all existing injection wells could create an unbearable burden of proof on the East Texas Saltwater Disposal Company and many of the independent operators in the East Texas field who can least afford the expense of such compliance. The cost of compliance with EPA's proposed revisions to the UIC Class II regulations is estimated to be $86.2 million to the East Texas Saltwater Disposal Company and the East Texas field operators for the first five years after promulgation of the regulations. Variance from complete AORs for the East Texas field could significantly reduce these anticipated costs. Successful application of the UMR variance methodology would also further establish the potential value of the methodology to other producing areas in Texas and the United States.     In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (D), a noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award to the UMR has been justified. DOE support of the activity would provide that analysis be made of proprietary non-public data which would otherwise be unavailable. In addition, DOE support would allow the results of the research to be transferred to oil and gas operators, to the State of Texas, and to the public. This effort is therefore considered suitable for noncompetitive financial assistance and would not be eligible for financial assistance under a solicitation.     DOE funding for this research is estimated to be approximately $500,000 for the 24 month duration of the project. These funds shall be used to pay for the reasonable cost of research staff, equipment, administrative support personnel, consultants, experts, and printing costs as necessary for the research project.

A further study of other high-priority areas in Texas, Phase II, will be initiated and completed in 1995. It is expected that the Phase I data required for AOR variance consideration will be supplied by the East Texas Salt Water Disposal Company, which operates injection wells for the field on behalf of field owners.         When the Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations were promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1980, existing Class II injection wells were excluded from AOR requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through a Federal Advisory Committee (FAC), has recently recommended that AORs for existing wells (which were not previously subject to that requirement) be performed within five years of promulgation of amended UIC regulations. The FAC has, however, recognized that conditions can exist that make it unnecessary to perform well-by-well AORs and that wells in a basin, producing trend, region or field, or a portion of such areas can be exempted from an AOR through a variance program.

text: null  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The Administrative Record, available for public review, contains background on BPA's Billing Credits Policy and a Record of Decision for the Wauna Cogeneration Project and environmental considerations.       I. Background       BPA is a self-financing power marketing agency with the United States Department of Energy. BPA was established by the Bonneville Project Act of 1937, 16 U.S.C. 832     et seq    ., to market wholesale power from Bonneville Dam and to construct power lines for the transmission of this power to load centers in the Northwest. BPA sells wholesale electric power and energy to 126 utilities, 13 direct service industrial customers and several government agencies.   The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act) directs BPA to serve the net power requirements of any electric utility requesting service, and to serve existing DSIs in the Pacific Northwest. 16 U.S.C. 839c(b)(1) and (d). Although BPA cannot own or construct electric generating facilities, the Northwest Power Act directs BPA to acquire rights to the output or capability of electric power resources to serve increased customer requirements. See 16 U.S.C. 839d(h). Billing Credits may be adjustments to customers' power bills or equivalent cash payments. Resources eligible for Billing Credits include conservation and generation.   Specific requirements for resources and the amount BPA can pay for these resources are outlined in the Northwest Power Act and BPA's Billing Credits Policy.   BPA's Billing Credits Policy interprets the Billing Credits provisions in the Northwest Power Act, prescribes criteria for customer and resource eligibility, and establishes procedures for granting Billing Credits.       II. Description of the Generation Proposal       BPA proposes to issue the Billing Credits as a method to facilitate Project construction pending the issuance of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service under section 9(f) of the Northwest Power Act relating to the portion of the Project's output that will be furnished to nongovernmental persons and the extent to which the private business use test of section 141(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will be met. Upon issuance of a ruling favorable to EWEB, the Billing Credits will terminate in favor of a negotiated Power Purchase Agreement with similar terms and conditions for all parties.   This project meets the qualifications for Billing Credits, and BPA has completed its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act. EWEB will comply with all applicable environmental requirements in the construction of the project and during the operation phase.       III. Methodology for Determining Generation Billing Credits       The payment for Billing Credits for EWEB will be calculated and paid monthly as follows:   EWEB is a Computed Requirements Customer under its Power Sales Contract with BPA, the monthly Billing Credits will be the lesser of the Adjusted Alternative Cost or Net Cost multiplied by the monthly amounts of Assured Energy Capability of the Billing Credits Resource, less the amount of Priority Firm Rate dollars EWEB avoids paying as a result of the Billing Credits Resource. There is no annual true-up because EWEB is required to maintain the Assured Energy Capability for the Billing Credits Resource, as it must do for all its firm resources under the Power Sales Contract.       IV. Materials Available       Copies of the Billing Credits Policy and the Administrative Record are available from BPA's Public Involvement Office.

The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment (EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the Canal Lateral Project.    1     This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project.               1      Algonquin Gas Transmission Company's (Algonquin) application was filed with the Commission under section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act.           Summary of the Proposed Project         Algonquin proposes to construct, own, and operate 4 miles of 18-inch-diameter pipeline, a meter station, valve site, and tap. Algonquin would use the facilities to transport up to 75,000 MMBtu of natural gas from Algonquin's existing G&hyph;111A valve site in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, to a valve site that would interconnect with nonjurisdictional facilities planned to be built by Canal Electric Company (CEC).     CEC would construct 0.9 mile of nonjurisdictional 18-inch-diameter pipeline and a regulator station. The facilities would supply an electric generating station operated by CEC and Montaup Electric Company (MEC) in Sandwich, Massachusetts.     The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1.    2                   2      The appendices referenced in this notice are not being printed in the     Federal Register    . Copies are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or call (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the appendices were sent to all those receiving this notice in the mail.           Land Requirements for Construction         The proposed lateral would be built adjacent and parallel to existing rights-of-way. Algonquin intends to use a construction right-of-way that would vary between 40 and 50 feet during construction within roads, 70 feet for crossing wetlands and waterbodies, 80 feet for upland areas, and 85 feet where additional spoil pile placement would be required due to site specific constraints. About 50 feet of the planned widths would use existing right-of-way; however, about 25 feet of new clearing would be required in many areas. Following construction, about 30 feet of the construction right-of-way would be allowed to revert to its former land use. Additional working space would be required adjacent to the planned construction right-of-way at road and stream crossings.         The EA Process         The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA.     The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings:     &bull;Geology and soils.    &bull;Water resources, fisheries, and wetlands.    &bull;Vegetation and wildlife.    &bull;Endangered and threatened species.     &bull;Land use.    &bull;Cultural resources.    &bull;Hazardous waste.    We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.     Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project.

text: nullnull      Currently Identified Environmental Issues         We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the environmental information provided by Algonquin. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are:     &bull;The construction right-of-way for the lateral would be within 50 feet of 10 residences.   &bull;The pipeline would cross one perennial stream (Herring River) and two wetlands.   &bull;The entire project would be within the Plymouth/Carver Sole Source Aquifer and about 90 percent of the proposed route crosses a ``high yield'' area.   &bull;The pipeline would cross three roads and be within four roads.   &bull;The project may have an impact on a state-listed Area of Critical Environmental Concern, and several state-listed rare flora and fauna.   &bull;The project would cross or be near 19 known prehistoric and 1 historic sites. There is high potential for additional cultural resources concerns within the project area.   &bull;The project would require a coastal zone consistency determination.         Public Participation         You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be.

Scoping Process:     In gathering background information for   preparation of the Environmental Assessment for the issuance   of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy   Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to   identify significant environmental issues related to the   construction and operation or the continued operation of   hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised   during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of   study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing   the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If   preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in   the scoping process would have little potential for causing   significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified   and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis   will be given.         q.     Request for Scoping Comments:     Federal, state, and local   resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers;   Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are   requested to forward to the Commission, any information that   they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting   an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and   cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing   activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested   to provide information related to the following items:         &bull;Information, data, maps or professional opinion that   may contribute to defining the geographical and   temporal scope of the analysis and identifying   significant environmental issues.         &bull;Identification of and information from any other EIS or   similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant   to the proposed licensing activities in the subject   river basin.         &bull;Existing information and any data that would aid in   describing the past and present effects of the   project(s) and other developmental activities on the   physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic   environments. For example, fish stocking/management   histories in the subject river, historic water quality   data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of   the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to   develop land and water resources within the basin.         &bull;Identification of any federal, state or local resource   plans and future project proposals that encompass the   subject river or basin.

text:   SUMMARY:     This proposed rule would amend the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) to exempt from assessments producers with less than 10 acres of watermelons rather than 5 acres and importers of less than 150,000 pounds, cover all 50 States by the Plan, and revise the criteria for determining the eligibility of producers to serve on the Board. In addition, conforming changes would be made to the rules and regulations issued under the Plan and the rules of practice for petitions. Furthermore, the Department is announcing that a referendum will be conducted among eligible producers, handlers, and importers to determine whether they favor the elimination of refunds of assessments and (2) whether they favor the assessment of watermelon imports and the addition of importer members to the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board).         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This proposed rule would amend the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan [7 CFR 1210], hereinafter referred as the Plan. The Plan is effective under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act, as amended by the Watermelon Research and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993 [7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916], hereinafter referred to as the Act.         This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).     This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.     The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.         Regulatory Flexibility Act         Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.     The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.     There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and   5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. There are approximately 140 importers of watermelons. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5 million and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers, producers, and importers may be classified as small entities.     The changes in the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice for petitions reflect amendments to the Act. The overall economic impact of these proposed changes is not expected to be significant. Including all 50 States and the District of Columbia under the Plan will have little impact. The producer exemption from assessments would be increased from 5 acres to 10 acres. This change would benefit small producers because it would increase the exemption level, and small producers would not have to pay the assessment. The eligibility criteria for determining if a person is a handler or a producer would not have any economic impact. The elimination of refunds may have some impact on a small amount of producers and handlers who are currently entitled to refunds. There will also be a new burden on importers caused by the assessment of imports, but importers are currently benefiting from the activities which promote watermelons without paying assessments. The research and promotion program is expected to continue to benefit producers, handlers, and importers subject to the Plan by expanding and maintaining new and existing markets. Accordingly, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.         Paperwork Reduction         In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980   [40 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093. There would be a new reporting burden on importers but the burden has been already approved by the OMB and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0093. This action adds no additional reporting burden. It has been estimated that it will take an average of 10 minutes for each producer, handler, and importer of watermelons to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting.         Background         Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary to verify their reporting.     U.S. production of watermelons is estimated through the use of U.S. shipment statistics. Shipments of U.S.-produced watermelons totaled about 1,895.6 million pounds in 1993,   7 percent less than in 1992. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled 343.5 million pounds, an increase of 12 percent. Therefore, domestic production is about six times as great as the volume of imports.     A proposed rule was published in the     Federal Register     on April 14, 1994 [59 FR 17739]. The rule published in April contained the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and regulations, rules of practice for petitions, and referendum procedures. In order to have the referendum procedures in place for the referendum, the Department decided to separately make final the referendum procedures. Therefore, this proposed rule contains the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice for petitions. A final rule published separately in this issue of the     Federal Register     contains the referendum procedures which will be used in the referendum.     The deadline for comments on the proposed amendments published on April 14 was May 16, 1994. Twenty-one comments were received.     Eighteen comments related to this proposed rule. Sixteen commentors stated their support of the proposed amendments to the Plan. They stated that per capita consumption of watermelons is on the increase again and that the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) has achieved many successes.     Two commentors stated that they are not in favor of the Plan and that they were not aware that a refund provision was available.

text: nullnull      A referendum was conducted in 1989 to determine if majority of watermelon growers and handlers favored the passage of an industry funded research and promotion program for watermelons. The Plan is intended to collect assessments for research and promotion of watermelons. Currently, any individual not favoring the program can request a refund of the assessments paid by that individual. Procedures to request a refund of assessments are explained in the Plan.     The amendments to the Act authorize an assessment on watermelons imported into the United States by importers, and the addition of importer members to the Board if approved by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers in a referendum. Watermelon imports enter the country primarily during the winter season. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled 343.5 million pounds. The assessment rate for imports would be the combined total assessment rate paid by producers and handlers of domestic watermelons. The current assessment rate for producers is 2 cents per hundredweight and for handlers is 2 cents per hundredweight. The combined assessment rate for importers, therefore, would be 4 cents per hundredweight. Assessments will be paid at the time the watermelons enter the country. The collection of assessments on imported watermelons will be expected to generate an additional $137,400 per year in revenue to the Board. In order to make these changes, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.305, 1210.320, 1210.321, 1210.328, 1210.341, 1210.350, 1210.351, 1210.352, 1210.363, and 1210.364 of the Plan; &sect;&sect;1210.402 and 1210.405 of the nomination procedures; and &sect;&sect;1210.515, 1210.518, 1210.519, 1210.521, 1210.530, 1210.531, and 1210.532 of the rules and regulations. In addition, a new &sect;1210.314 will be added to the Plan.     To facilitate the collection of assessments on imported watermelons, the Secretary proposes that the United States Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury be designated as the collecting agency for assessments levied on such imports. Other commodity research and promotion programs utilize the Customs Service as a means of collecting assessments on imported products, and the Customs Service is agreeable to collecting these watermelon assessments. An agreement between the USDA and the Customs Service would be entered into to implement this action. In order to make this changes, this rule would amend &sect;1210.518 of the Rules and Regulations.     The importer representation on the Board would be proportionate to the percentage of assessments paid by importers to the Board, except that at least one representative of importers would serve on the Board if importers are subject to the Plan. This representation would enable importers to participate in developing the Board's programs, plans, and projects, and express their views and concerns on how Board funds are used if imports are assessed under the Plan. Importers would nominate individuals to serve as importer members on the Board, and as required for other members of the Board, two nominees would be submitted to the Secretary for each vacancy. The Act requires the number of importers members to be proportionate to the assessments paid by importers. However, it is necessary to calculate the number of initial importer members on the volume of imports because imports are not currently being assessed. There are currently 14 producers and 14 handlers on the Board. This is the equivalent of one domestic industry member for every 67.7 million pounds of domestic production. Based on the average annual volume of imports during the last 3-year period (323.1 hundredweight), four importers would be added to the current Board. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect; 1210.320, 1210.321, and 1210.401.     The Act provides for the elimination of refunds of assessments if the producers, handlers, and importers vote to eliminate refunds. The refund provision has been in effect since the beginning of the program. Refunds have been increasing every year from 9 percent in 1990 to almost 29 percent in 1993. If the refund provision is eliminated, it would provide the Board with an estimated additional $250,000 per year for research and promotion activities. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.343 and 1210.520.     If the refund provision remains in the Plan, and importers are subject to the Plan, then importers would be entitled to a refund of all assessments paid on watermelons imported into the United States.     The Act increases the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons. Importers of less than 150,000 pounds of watermelons per year would be entitled to apply for a refund which would be the producer equivalent of the import assessments. The 150,000-pound exemption level for importers is the level determined to be equivalent to 10 acres of watermelons for domestic producers. In addition, the Act provides that the Board has the authority to establish rules for producers to certify whether they are exempt from the assessments. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.341, 1210.342, 1210.518, and 1210.521.     The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia. This amendment would expand the Plan to cover producers, handlers, and importers in Hawaii, Alaska, and the District of Columbia. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;1210.305 and would add a new &sect;1210.315.     Section 1647(f) of the Act permits changes in the assessment rate through notice and comment rulemaking. No change to the Plan is necessary to implement this amendment to the Act because &sect;1210.341 of the Plan states that assessment rates shall be fixed by the Secretary in accordance with section 1647(f) of the Act.     The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision facilitates the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific group. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect; 1210.321, 1210.363, 1210.368, and 1210.402.     The Act also provides that all future promulgation and amendment referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act would now allow referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which would reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363.     In addition, the Act changes the criteria for determining the outcome of referenda. The Act previously provided that the Plan should not be effective unless approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers and handlers voting in the referendum, or producers and handlers of not less than two-thirds of the watermelons produced and handled during the representative period by producers and handlers voting in the referendum, and by not less than a majority of the producers and a majority of the handlers voting in the referendum. The Act now specifies that the determination of the results of a referendum should be on the basis of a simple majority of the producers, handlers, and, if covered by the Plan, importers voting in the referendum. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363.     Furthermore, &sect;1210.252 would be revised to correct a wording error made during the promulgation of the Plan and &sect;1210.322 would be revised to delete obsolete language.     In addition, &sect;1210.325 would be changed to reflect a change in the number of Board members that constitute a majority. This revision would reflect the addition of importer members to the Board.

In addition, miscellaneous conforming changes would be made to &sect;&sect;1210.251, 1210.302, 1210.328, 1210.340, and 1210.362.   Minor changes are made in this final rule for the purpose of clarity.       Referendum Order       It is hereby directed that a referendum be conducted among watermelon producers, handlers, and importers to determine whether they favor: (1) eliminating the provisions for assessment refunds and (2) implementing assessments on imported watermelons and adding importer members to the Board.   The referendum shall be conducted from November 1 to   November 30, 1994. Ballots will be mailed to all known eligible watermelon producers, handlers, and importers on or before November 1, 1994. Eligible voters that do not receive a ballot by mail should call the Department's office in Washington, D.C. in order to receive a ballot. A toll free number will be available to request a ballot. All ballots will be subject to verification. Ballots must be received by the referendum agents no later than November 30, 1994, to be counted.   Sonia N. Jimenez and Martha B.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes to amend its regulations governing the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development program authorized by sections 7(j)(10) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(10), 637(a). This proposed rule would amend both eligibility requirements for and contractual assistance provisions within the 8(a) program. Of particular note, this rule would recognize participation of Community Development Corporations in the 8(a) program to an extent that would not be inconsistent with the requirements of the 8(a) program as imposed by the Small Business Act, increase the personal net worth limitations for 8(a) applicants and Program Participants to take into account inflation, eliminate the distinctions established in SBA's regulations concerning ``local'' and ``national buy'' 8(a) requirements, eliminate the restrictions on the number and dollar value of 8(a) contracts received by Program Participants due to SBA-approved ``support levels'', and eliminate the distinction for applying the competitive 8(a) requirements currently existing for indefinite quantity or indefinite delivery requirements.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would (1) make several clarifications of the eligibility requirements for admission to SBA's 8(a) program, the need for which has been identified by SBA through the practical experience gained in operating the program and in defending the agency's actions in 8(a) eligibility appeals brought before SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), (2) authorize participation by business concerns owned by Community Development Corporations in the 8(a) program in accord with 42 U.S.C. 9815, and (3) make several changes to the 8(a) contractual assistance requirements, including eliminating 8(a) support levels and the concepts of local buy and national buy 8(a) requirements.          This rule would clarify that 8(a) eligibility decisions are based on the facts before the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development (AA/MSB&amp;COD) at the time of his/her eligibility decision. The rule would specify that actual control of the applicant concern must be in the hands of one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals at the time the appropriate district Certification and Eligibility Branch (C &amp; E Branch) determines that an application for the 8(a) program is complete. Potential control or the power of disadvantaged individuals to change the applicant concern's Board of Directors or other aspects of control so that the applicant concern     could be     controlled by disadvantaged individuals, no matter how easily exercised, would not satisfy the requirement that the applicant be     actually     controlled by disadvantaged individuals at the time the SBA district office C &amp; E Branch determines an application to be complete. One reason to require actual control at the time that an applicant applies for admission to the 8(a) program is to prevent ``front companies'' from being admitted to the 8(a) program. It is SBA's view that this potential for abuse would be greatly lessened by the clarifications made in this rule.    In addition, Section 626(a)(2) of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, codified at 42 U.S.C. 9815(a)(2), required ``regulations to ensure the availability to community development corporations of such programs as shall further the purposes of this subchapter, including programs under section [8(a) of the Small Business Act].'' The purpose of the subchapter referred to in this provision ``is to encourage the development of special programs by which the residents of urban and rural low-income areas may, through self-help and mobilization of the community at large, with appropriate Federal assistance, improve the quality of their economic and social participation in community life in such a way as to contribute to the elimination of poverty and the establishment of permanent economic and social benefits.'' 42 U.S.C. 9801. SBA has not heretofore implemented this authority through regulations. This proposed rule would recognize participation of Community Development Corporations (CDCs) in the 8(a) program to an extent that would not be inconsistent with the requirements of the 8(a) program imposed by the Small Business Act.    SBA believes that only CDC-owned or financed small business concerns can be eligible for the 8(a) program, and not the CDC itself. This position is consistent with the Agency's longstanding regulations implementing the Small Business Act that a small business must be a for-profit business entity.     See     13 CFR 121.403. Since CDCs are non-profit entities, they could not be considered small business concerns within the meaning of the size regulations and, hence, would not be eligible for the 8(a) program on that basis.    This rule is not intended to imply in any way that the basic requirement of the Small Business Act that 8(a) concerns be owned by disadvantaged individuals can be administratively changed. Presently, two statutory exceptions to this ownership requirement have been implemented in regulations. Subclauses 8(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) and (III) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) and (III), statutorily extend 8(a) program eligibility to small business concerns which are owned by either an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe, or a wholly owned business entity of such a tribe, or a Native Hawaiian organization. These provisions have been implemented in 13 CFR &sect;&sect;124.112 and 124.113, respectively. The authority for extending eligibility for the 8(a) program to CDC-owned entities is also statutory. Thus, similar to SBA's treatment of tribally-owned concerns and concerns owned by Native Hawaiian organizations, this proposed rule recognizes CDC-owned concerns in accord with the authority set forth in 42 U.S.C. 9815(a)(2).    Pursuant to this proposed rule, SBA would consider CDCs comparable to Indian tribes. A CDC could have an ownership interest in several business enterprises, just like an Indian tribe under current regulations. Where statute and implementing regulations authorize a tribally-owned business concern to participate in the 8(a) program, but not the tribe acting on its own behalf, SBA proposes that similar treatment be afforded CDCs and CDC-owned business concerns. SBA also believes that the regulatorily created exclusion from affiliation that has been afforded tribally-owned business concerns (i.e., one tribally-owned business is not considered affiliated with the tribe or other businesses owned by the tribe merely because of common tribal ownership) should be extended to CDC-owned business concerns as well (this proposal would also make that exclusion available to concerns owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations).                      <USDEPT>SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>       13 CFR Parts 121 and 124         Small Business Size Regulations; Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Assistance       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Small Business Administration.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Proposed rule.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes to amend its regulations governing the Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development program authorized by sections 7(j)(10) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(10), 637(a). This proposed rule would amend both eligibility requirements for and contractual assistance provisions within the 8(a) program. Of particular note, this rule would recognize participation of Community Development Corporations in the 8(a) program to an extent that would not be inconsistent with the requirements of the 8(a) program as imposed by the Small Business Act, increase the personal net worth limitations for 8(a) applicants and Program Participants to take into account inflation, eliminate the distinctions established in SBA's regulations concerning ``local'' and ``national buy'' 8(a) requirements, eliminate the restrictions on the number and dollar value of 8(a) contracts received by Program Participants due to SBA-approved ``support levels'', and eliminate the distinction for applying the competitive 8(a) requirements currently existing for indefinite quantity or indefinite delivery requirements.         </SUMMARY> <DATE>  DATES:     Comments must be submitted on or before September 29, 1994.         </DATE> <ADDRESS>  ADDRESSES:     Written comments should be addressed to Herbert L. Mitchell, Associate Administrator, Office of Minority Enterprise Development, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW, Washington, DC 20416.         </ADDRESS>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Office of Minority Enterprise Development, (202) 205&hyph;6410.           <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would (1) make several clarifications of the eligibility requirements for admission to SBA's 8(a) program, the need for which has been identified by SBA through the practical experience gained in operating the program and in defending the agency's actions in 8(a) eligibility appeals brought before SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), (2) authorize participation by business concerns owned by Community Development Corporations in the 8(a) program in accord with 42 U.S.C. 9815, and (3) make several changes to the 8(a) contractual assistance requirements, including eliminating 8(a) support levels and the concepts of local buy and national buy 8(a) requirements.          This rule would clarify that 8(a) eligibility decisions are based on the facts before the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development (AA/MSB&amp;COD) at the time of his/her eligibility decision. The rule would specify that actual control of the applicant concern must be in the hands of one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals at the time the appropriate district Certification and Eligibility Branch (C &amp; E Branch) determines that an application for the 8(a) program is complete. Potential control or the power of disadvantaged individuals to change the applicant concern's Board of Directors or other aspects of control so that the applicant concern     could be     controlled by disadvantaged individuals, no matter how easily exercised, would not satisfy the requirement that the applicant be     actually     controlled by disadvantaged individuals at the time the SBA district office C &amp; E Branch determines an application to be complete. One reason to require actual control at the time that an applicant applies for admission to the 8(a) program is to prevent ``front companies'' from being admitted to the 8(a) program. It is SBA's view that this potential for abuse would be greatly lessened by the clarifications made in this rule.    In addition, Section 626(a)(2) of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, codified at 42 U.S.C. 9815(a)(2), required ``regulations to ensure the availability to community development corporations of such programs as shall further the purposes of this subchapter, including programs under section [8(a) of the Small Business Act].'' The purpose of the subchapter referred to in this provision ``is to encourage the development of special programs by which the residents of urban and rural low-income areas may, through self-help and mobilization of the community at large, with appropriate Federal assistance, improve the quality of their economic and social participation in community life in such a way as to contribute to the elimination of poverty and the establishment of permanent economic and social benefits.'' 42 U.S.C. 9801. SBA has not heretofore implemented this authority through regulations. This proposed rule would recognize participation of Community Development Corporations (CDCs) in the 8(a) program to an extent that would not be inconsistent with the requirements of the 8(a) program imposed by the Small Business Act.    SBA believes that only CDC-owned or financed small business concerns can be eligible for the 8(a) program, and not the CDC itself. This position is consistent with the Agency's longstanding regulations implementing the Small Business Act that a small business must be a for-profit business entity.     See     13 CFR 121.403. Since CDCs are non-profit entities, they could not be considered small business concerns within the meaning of the size regulations and, hence, would not be eligible for the 8(a) program on that basis.    This rule is not intended to imply in any way that the basic requirement of the Small Business Act that 8(a) concerns be owned by disadvantaged individuals can be administratively changed. Presently, two statutory exceptions to this ownership requirement have been implemented in regulations. Subclauses 8(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) and (III) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) and (III), statutorily extend 8(a) program eligibility to small business concerns which are owned by either an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe, or a wholly owned business entity of such a tribe, or a Native Hawaiian organization. These provisions have been implemented in 13 CFR &sect;&sect;124.112 and 124.113, respectively. The authority for extending eligibility for the 8(a) program to CDC-owned entities is also statutory. Thus, similar to SBA's treatment of tribally-owned concerns and concerns owned by Native Hawaiian organizations, this proposed rule recognizes CDC-owned concerns in accord with the authority set forth in 42 U.S.C. 9815(a)(2).    Pursuant to this proposed rule, SBA would consider CDCs comparable to Indian tribes. A CDC could have an ownership interest in several business enterprises, just like an Indian tribe under current regulations. Where statute and implementing regulations authorize a tribally-owned business concern to participate in the 8(a) program, but not the tribe acting on its own behalf, SBA proposes that similar treatment be afforded CDCs and CDC-owned business concerns. SBA also believes that the regulatorily created exclusion from affiliation that has been afforded tribally-owned business concerns (i.e., one tribally-owned business is not considered affiliated with the tribe or other businesses owned by the tribe merely because of common tribal ownership) should be extended to CDC-owned business concerns as well (this proposal would also make that exclusion available to concerns owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations).      </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      In order for any CDC-owned business to participate in the 8(a) program, SBA would apply the basic management and control requirements imposed by the Small Business Act for 8(a) program participation. Thus, the proposed rule would require that CDC-owned applicant concerns must be managed by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  This proposed rule would also make changes, as needed, in various other eligibility and 8(a) contracting requirements. These changes are identified below in the section by section analysis of this proposed rule.      Section By Section Analysis      The following is a section by section analysis of each provision of SBA's regulations that would be affected by this proposed rule:  Sections 121.906(b)(1)(iv) and 121.1106(b)(1)(iv) would be amended to permit a small business non-manufacturer to supply other than a product made in the United States for a small business set-aside or 8(a) contract where the procuring agency makes a non-availability determination pursuant to &sect;25.102(a)(4) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. There has been some confusion as to whether a non-manufacturer could qualify as a small business if there was such a non-availability determination under the Buy American Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. SBA did not intend to exclude non-manufacturers from small business set-aside and 8(a) contracts where such a non-availability determination has been made. This clarification should clear up any ambiguity in this area.  Section 121.1104 would be amended to impose its provisions on competitive as well as sole source 8(a) contracting opportunities. Heretofore, this regulation was inconsistent with competitive contracting procedures. Other minor changes for purposes of improved clarity would also be made to this section.  Section 121.1703(b) would be amended to clarify that only the AA/MSB&amp;COD can appeal a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code assigned by a procuring agency contracting officer to either a sole source or a competitive 8(a) requirement.     See     discussion relating to proposed &sect;124.307(f).  Section 124.100 would be amended by adding definitions of the terms ``CDC-owned concern'', ``Clear and convincing evidence'', and ``Community Development Corporation or CDC''.  The definition of ``Unconditional ownership'' in &sect;124.100 would be amended to explain that a disadvantaged owner may use his/her ownership interest (e.g., stock) in an applicant or 8(a) concern as collateral for financing during the normal course of business without affecting his/her ``unconditional'' ownership in such concern, provided that complete control of the ownership interest remains with the disadvantaged owner absent any default in fulfilling the terms of the financing. However, events of default must be defined in commercially reasonable ways. Events of default beyond those that are deemed commercially reasonable could lead to a conclusion that unconditional ownership is not in the hands of the disadvantaged owner. This clarification is not intended to require a concern to obtain financing through a financial institution or to preclude, for example, seller-financed transactions. It is intended only to permit financing terms that are reasonable within the marketplace. This change is essential to ensure that applicant and 8(a) concerns have the flexibility they need to raise necessary capital. The requirement that disadvantaged owners ``unconditionally'' own and control an applicant or 8(a) concern should not restrict a firm's ability to raise capital under normal commercial terms and conditions to assist it in becoming viable.  The proposed rule would eliminate the definitions for ``local buy'' and ``national buy'' requirements from &sect;124.100. All requirements other than construction requirements would be open to eligible 8(a) Participants nationally. To the extent possible, SBA seeks to lift restrictions that are otherwise not imposed in procurements conducted other than through the 8(a) program. This would result in all eligible 8(a) concerns nationally being able to submit offers in response to competitive 8(a) solicitations. In addition, a Program Participant could market and seek sole source 8(a) requirements nationally. Construction requirements would be exempt from this change because section 8(a)(11) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(11), requires, ``to the maximum extent practicable,'' that 8(a) construction contracts ``be awarded within the county or State where the work is to be performed.'' The proposed rule would make necessary changes in &sect;124.308(d), &sect;124.308(f), revised &sect;124.311(d), (old &sect;124.311(e)), revised &sect;124.311(e) (old &sect;124.311(f)), and revised &sect;124.311(f) (old &sect;124.311(h)) to eliminate the local and national buy concepts.  The proposed rule would make minor technical changes to &sect;&sect;124.101(a), 124.101(b), 124.102(a), 124.103, 124.104, and 124.109(d) to recognize that CDC-owned concerns would be eligible for participation in the 8(a) program.  Sections 124.101(a), 124.104 and 124.206(a) would be amended to clarify that the AA/MSB&amp;COD's decision to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program participation would be based on whether the applicant concern complied with each of SBA's eligibility criteria at the time the concern's completed application for admission to the 8(a) program is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing or, in the case of a request for reconsideration, at the time the reconsideration application is deemed to be complete by SBA's Central Office. A change in circumstances submitted by an applicant concern subsequent to the date that an application or reconsideration action is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing would not be considered, unless it causes a loss of eligibility. The structure of the concern, including all necessary corporate formalities, would have to be in place prior to the Office of MSB&amp;COD's processing of an application or request for reconsideration. A disadvantaged individual's ability to immediately change the applicant's structure or effect a change in its control so that actual control of the concern is in the hands of disadvantaged individuals and/or other eligibility criteria are met would not satisfy the requirement that they be met at the time of the completed application. The rule would specify, however, that SBA, in its sole discretion, could request clarification of information contained in the application at any stage in the application process.

text: nullnull      The decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program admission would then be based on whether the application, as clarified by any information submitted in response to a request by SBA, demonstrates that the applicant concern complies with each of SBA's eligibility criteria. While SBA would be able to request and consider additional information in processing an 8(a) application, SBA would not consider information gratuitously submitted by an applicant concern after it submits its application. This clarification is needed to streamline the application process and ensure that SBA meets its statutorily imposed time limitation for processing applications.    Section 124.103 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (a) that would require direct ownership of 8(a) applicants or Program Participants by disadvantaged     individuals.     This statutory requirement is currently set forth in &sect;124.109, but SBA believes that it should be added to this section for clarification purposes. Present &sect;&sect;124.103(a) through (j) would be redesignated to become &sect;&sect;124.103(b) through (k). Sections 124.109(d) and (e) would be similarly amended.    Newly redesignated &sect;124.103(i) (old &sect;124.103(h)) would be amended to permit a former Program Participant to have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business. Such a requirement would increase an 8(a) concern's ability to raise capital, while continuing to advance the economic viability of a former Program Participant after its 8(a) program term has expired. Section &sect;124.104(c)(2) would also be amended to permit the principal of a former Program Participant to have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business as the former Program Participant.    Newly redesignated &sect;124.103(j) (old &sect;124.103(i)) would be amended to make clear that an 8(a) concern may substitute one disadvantaged individual for another without invoking the termination for convenience/waiver provision of &sect;124.317 of these regulations with respect to any 8(a) contracts that it has been awarded on or after June 1, 1989. Provided program eligibility is maintained and SBA approves a substitution of one disadvantaged individual for another, performance of 8(a) contracts already received could continue without seeking a waiver under &sect;124.317. SBA believes that the statutory termination for convenience/waiver provision did not intend to prohibit the performance of an 8(a) contract by the 8(a) concern that initially received it simply where there has been one or more approved changes of particular individuals upon whom eligibility of the concern was based. This change is necessary to apprise procuring agencies and 8(a) concerns that termination of 8(a) contracts is not required in such instances.    Pursuant to proposed &sect;124.103(l), SBA would aggregate the ownership interests of a business concern and its principal(s) in determining whether a non-disadvantaged individual or business concern exceeds the 10 percent equity ownership limitations (or, in the case of a former Program Participant, the 20 percent equity ownership limitations) established by &sect;&sect;124.103 and 124.104.    This proposed rule would also add a new &sect;124.103(m), dealing with the applicability of state community property laws on the respective ownership interests in an applicant concern or a Program Participant once admitted to the Program. This revision would not be a change in SBA policy.    Section 124.104(a) would be reorganized for greater clarity and easier use. Of particular note, &sect;124.104(a) would be amended to specify that one or more disadvantaged individuals who are determined to manage the applicant or 8(a) concern must be physically located at the offices of the applicant or 8(a) concern be open during the normal 40-hour work week of most business concerns. Thus, this proposed provision would require that the disadvantaged individual(s) be present at the location of the applicant or 8(a) concern during those hours and not, for example, only at night or on the weekends. This rule does not imply that business activities of the applicant or 8(a) concern could not be conducted by such individual(s) outside the offices of the applicant or 8(a) concern, nor does it prohibit a disadvantaged individual from establishing an 8(a) concern at his/her home. It is meant to ensure only that one or more disadvantaged owners devote full-time to the business of the applicant or 8(a) concern. Under this proposed amendment, SBA would not permit an individual to be physically located at a job which is separate and distinct from the applicant or 8(a) concern during normal business hours and claim that he/she is managing the applicant or 8(a) concern from that location.    Section 124.104(b) would be amended along the lines set forth above for &sect;&sect;124.101(a), 124,104 and 124.206(a). This amended paragraph would specify that the Board of Directors must actually be controlled by disadvantaged individuals. The power of a disadvantaged individual to control the Board of Directors indirectly through his/her right to vote his/her stock (i.e., the power to remove and replace directors) would not be sufficient to establish control of the Board of Directors if non-disadvantaged individuals on the Board of Directors could control, or assert negative control on, the Board as currently structured at the time of the application for admission to the 8(a) program. This paragraph would also provide that non-voting, advisory or honorary Directors may be appointed so long as they do not possess negative control over the Board. Similarly, a separate board of advisors, particularly in the context of tribally-owned applicants and 8(a) concerns, could be established provided such board of advisors could not actually run the day-to-day operations of or possess negative control over the applicant or 8(a) business concern.

text: nullnull      In evaluating whether an individual's social disadvantage has negatively impacted on his or her entry into and/or advancement in the business world, &sect;124.105(c) would be amended to clarify that SBA will entertain any relevant evidence, but that SBA would consider the experiences of the individual, where applicable, in education, employment and business history. The failure to establish disadvantage in any one area (i.e., education, employment, or business history) would not prevent an individual from meeting this requirement of negative impact as long as the totality of the circumstances experienced by the individual demonstrate his/her disadvantage in entering into and/or advancing in the business world.    Section 124.106(a)(2)(i) would be amended by increasing the entry level personal net worth limitation from $250,000 to $300,000 in order to take into account inflation. The $250,000 net worth figure was established by regulation in April 1989. Inflation increased 19.6 percent between April 1989 and March 1994 based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. Applying the 19.6 percent inflation rate to the $250,000 figure would increase the net worth limitation to $299,000. This proposed rule would round that amount to $300,000.    Section 124.106(a)(2)(ii) would clarify SBA's method of analysis in determining whether the applicant concern itself, as apart from its disadvantaged owner(s), should be considered economically disadvantaged. It would require SBA to compare an applicant concern to other small business concerns in the same four-digit Standard Industrial Classification Code which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.    Section 124.106(a)(2)(i)(A)(    1    ) would be amended to provide that assets transferred by an individual claiming disadvantaged status to any immediate family member within two years prior to the date of application to the 8(a) program shall be presumed to be the property of the individual claiming disadvantaged status. Currently, property or assets transferred by an individual claiming disadvantaged status to his/her spouse within two years of the date of 8(a) application is presumed to be the property of the transferor for purposes of determining his/her economic disadvantage. SBA believes that a change is needed to prevent circumvention of its eligibility regulations by asset transfers to other than an applicant individual's spouse. Several applicants have avoided the intent of this regulation by transferring assets to children. SBA believes that it is necessary to prevent the recurrence of this practice, which if left unchanged, could admit firms into the 8(a) program that SBA believes should be considered ineligible.    Section 124.106(b) would be amended for clarity, and would increase the personal net worth limitation for the Small Disadvantaged Business program from $750,000 to $900,000 to take into account inflation since the $750,000 standard was set in April 1989.    Section 124.107(b) would be amended to clarify that the requirement that an applicant concern possess technical and managerial experience to be deemed to have the required potential for success to be admitted to the 8(a) program was not meant to contradict the provision in &sect;124.104 that the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based need not posses both management and technical capabilities. In order to have the requisite potential for success, an applicant concern must have both management and technical experience. Conversely, the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based must possess either management or technical capabilities to meet that part of the control requirement under &sect;124.104.    Section 124.108 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (d)(3) that would state that any 8(a) applicant that is a dealer or wholesaler would not be required to demonstrate that it is capable of supplying the product of a small business manufacturer in conjunction with its 8(a) application. In the past, there has been confusion as to whether SBA's non-manufacturer rule (i.e., the rule requiring a regular dealer to supply the product of a small business in order for it to be considered small for a specific 8(a) or small business set aside procurement) should be applied in determining an applicant's initial eligibility for the 8(a) program. SBA believes that because the Small Business Act authorizes waivers to the non-manufacturer rule in connection with a specific contract where SBA determines that no small business manufacturer can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the specifications of the solicitation, the non-manufacturer rule should have no bearing on an applicant's eligibility for the 8(a) program. In addition, the 8(a) program should not be viewed solely as a contracting program. There is other business development assistance available to Program Participants which should not be foreclosed because of the non-manufacturer rule. Regular dealer applicants to the 8(a) program should be aware, however, that they must generally meet the requirements of the non-manufacturer rule in order to be awarded specific 8(a) contracts as regular dealers.    Proposed &sect;124.109(f) would add a provision making an applicant to the 8(a) program ineligible for program participation if the proprietor, or a holder of at least 20 percent of the stock, or a partner, officer, director of the concern is currently incarcerated, on parole or on probation. This provision is derived from a similar determination of ineligibility for SBA financial assistance currently contained in 13 CFR 120.101&hyph;2(f).    Section 124.111 would be amended by revising paragraph (a)(2) to set the same personal net worth limitation for a Program Participant in either the developmental or transitional stage of program participation to maintain its continued 8(a) eligibility. Currently, the limit is $500,000 for firms in the developmental stage of 8(a) program participation, $750,000 for firms in the transitional stage of 8(a) program participation, and $750,000 for purposes of eligibility for the Department of Defense's Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) program. This rule would eliminate the separate net worth figure for firms in the developmental stage (i.e., eliminating the current $500,000 amount). It would then apply the $750,000 amount, adjusted for inflation, to all participant firms to make the requirement for developmental firms consistent with continued eligibility for transitional firms and simplify program administration. As with the entry level personal net worth limitation amount, the $750,000 figure would also be increased by 19.6 percent due to inflation (    see     discussion relating to proposed &sect;124.106(a)(2)(i)). A straight inflation adjustment would produce a net worth limitation of $897,000. This proposed rule would round that amount to $900,000.

text: nullnull      Section 124.111(c)(5) would be amended to further restrict excessive withdrawals from 8(a) Program Participants by their owners or managers. Specifically, a Participant could no longer claim that large withdrawals from the Participant should not be restricted where the concern's net worth has continued to increase throughout the period of time the withdrawals are made. Certain Program Participants have attempted to claim that excessive withdrawals could not be penalized where the Participant's net worth continued to increase because the withdrawals were not detrimental to the attainment of its business plan. The 8(a) program is designed to foster the development of business concerns owned by disadvantaged individuals. The fact that Participant's net worth has increased does not mean that it would not have increased more or achieved greater success but for excessive withdrawals by its owners/managers.    Section 124.112(c)(2)(iv) would be amended to clarify the requirements pertaining to a joint venture between an 8(a) concern owned by an Indian tribe and a concern determined to be other than small. There has been some concern that this regulation required a majority of the performance of such a contract to be performed on an Indian reservation or land owned by the tribe. This was not the intent. This proposed rule would amend this provision to make it consistent with the same provision contained in &sect;124.321 which requires only that the tribally-owned 8(a) concern must perform most of its activities generally on the reservation or tribally-owned land in order to be eligible to joint venture with a large business. This provision contains no specific requirement that the work done through the joint venture must be done on the Indian reservation or tribally-owned land. However, it is necessary not to overlook two requirements which may perpetuate that requirement in some instances_that the concern must be located on the reservation or tribally-owned land, and that the 8(a) participant to a joint venture must meet the performance of work requirements imposed by &sect;124.314.     See     &sect;124.321(f).    Section 124.113 would be amended by adding an exclusion from affiliation for concerns owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization, by prohibiting a Native Hawaiian Organization from owning more than one current or former 8(a) Participant having the same primary industry classification, and by excluding from the one-time individual eligibility requirement any individual who merely manages a concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization.    The proposed rule would add a new &sect;124.114 which would specifically authorize CDC-owned small business concerns to participate in the 8(a) program. The same amendments added to &sect;124.113 for Native Hawaiian Organizations would be added to this section regarding CDC-owned concerns.    Minor clarifying language would be added to &sect;124.206(c)(1) regarding the time frame for an applicant concern to request a reconsideration, and where such a request must be made.    Sections 124.208(c) and 124.209(b) would be amended to streamline the procedures governing graduation and termination of 8(a) Program Participants respectively. This rule would eliminate the second letter of notification and the second 45 day response period provided in &sect;124.208(c) and &sect;124.209(b).    Additionally, this rule would change the time period in which the Division Director must make a recommendation on graduation to the AA/MSB&amp;COD. The rule would change the time frame for the Division Director's recommendation to the AA/MSB&amp;COD from 15 days to 45 days.    Section 124.209(b) currently provides the same procedures and time limits regarding termination actions as are discussed above with regard to graduation from the 8(a) program. This rule would make the same changes to the termination procedures as are discussed above with regard to graduation from the 8(a) program.    The proposed rule would amend the procedures concerning remands of 8(a) eligibility appeals by OHA to the AA/MSB&amp;COD. Section 124.210(h)(2) would clarify that the AA/MSB&amp;COD would issue a decision in accordance with a remand order of the Administrative Law Judge within 10 working days of the remand, unless the AA/MSB&amp;COD requests and the Administrative Law Judge grants an extension thereof. An applicant or 8(a) concern could then appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's remand decision to OHA within 20 working days of the date that the decision is mailed. The failure of an applicant to file an appeal within the 20-day time frame would serve to make the remand decision the final agency decision and would not require any further action by OHA.    Section 124.210 would be further amended by adding a new paragraph (k) to specifically authorize reconsideration of 8(a) eligibility appeal decisions made by SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals. Reconsideration would be specifically authorized where a petitioning party establishes a clear error of law or fact affecting the decision in the case.    Section 124.302 would be amended to ease the restrictions on adding SIC codes once a concern is admitted to the 8(a) program. The proposed rule would permit SBA to approve an additional SIC code as long as a rational business explanation exists for acquiring the requested SIC code. SBA seeks to make it clear that the authority to make decisions regarding what types of business ventures an 8(a) concern should get involved in rests with the 8(a) concerns themselves. Thus, for example, an 8(a) concern may acquire or develop the capability to perform contracts in an industry not directly related to the 8(a) concern's primary business and seek to add the appropriate SIC code(s), or it may hire an additional key employee that opens up new avenues of work to the 8(a) concern and seek to add additional SIC codes. In addition, SBA proposes to shorten the time it takes SBA to respond to a request for a change in SIC code designations from 45 days to 30 days.    The proposed rule would amend &sect;124.305(b)(3) regarding what a Program Participant must demonstrate to qualify for an 8(a) bond exemption. As currently written, in order to qualify for a bond exemption, an 8(a) Program Participant must, among other things, demonstrate that it cannot obtain a bond for the performance of the specific 8(a) requirement at issued by submitting to SBA written denials from at least two sureties, one of which is a corporate surety and one of which is an individual surety. Based on experience with this provision, SBA believes that the requirement that two sureties decline to issue the required bond is unnecessary. As such, the proposed rule would amend &sect;124.305(b)(3) to require a Participant to demonstrate only that it cannot obtain a bond from one corporate (Treasury-listed) surety.    The proposed rule would revise &sect;124.305(c)(4) to provide that a Program Participant may be eligible to receive only two bond exemptions at any one time. In other words, although up to five bond exemptions per Program Participant are authorized, a Participant may not have more than two active 8(a) contracts at a time for which it has received a bond exemption.

text: nullnull      This proposed rule would also eliminate the requirement that a Program Participant not be permitted to receive 8(a) contracts in excess of its approved 8(a) support level. However, this would not affect SBA's authority to impose a limit on the amount of 8(a) contract awards as a part of a remedial action plan where a firm fails to meet its competitive business mix requirements. A concern would still be required to project in its business plan its anticipated level of 8(a) contract support, but such level would be used only as a planning and development tool. Section 124.307 would be amended by redesignating paragraph ``(d)'' as paragraph ``(e)'' and by adding a new paragraph ``(d)'' that would eliminate approved 8(a) support levels as a basis for denying 8(a) contract awards in excess of those levels. SBA believes that Program Participants should be afforded the flexibility to seek out and receive 8(a) contracts so long as they are capable and responsible to perform those contracts and meet their competitive business mix requirements. SBA would still determine whether a Participant was responsible to perform a particular 8(a) procurement requirement, and could determine that the concern did not have the capacity to perform the extra work, but, except as part of an approved remedial action plan, it could not withhold award merely because the concern would exceed (or has exceeded) its approved support level.    Section 124.307 would be further amended by adding a new paragraph ``(f)'' that would prohibit any party from challenging the eligibility of a Program Participant for a specific sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement at SBA or any other administrative forum. Much of this provision is currently contained in &sect;124.311(g) for competitive 8(a) requirements, but no such specific language was set forth for sole source 8(a) requirements. The regulatory language appearing in &sect;124.311(g) would be moved into this new provision and would be expanded to apply to sole source 8(a) procurements as well. Section 124.311(g) would be removed as unnecessary.    In addition, the proposed rule would specify that only the AA/MSB&amp;COD could file a SIC code appeal in connection with either a sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement. While this restriction appears in &sect;121.1703, as part of SBA's size and SIC code appeal regulations, it was not similarly contained in the 8(a) regulations. SBA believes that it should appear in both places for clarity and ease of use. It would specifically apply to both sole source and competitive 8(a) requirements. SBA reviews every SIC code to determine its appropriateness, but so long as the code assigned by the procuring agency contracting officer is reasonable, SBA will concur. SBA frequently goes back to a procuring agency to dispute a SIC code when it feels that the statement of work indicates that the assigned SIC code is inappropriate. Discussions between SBA and the procuring agency normally clear up any confusion. As part of this process, any party may submit evidence to SBA to explain why it believes another SIC code should be assigned to the procurement. SBA will consider such information and will seek a SIC code change if it believes that the SIC code assigned by the procuring agency is unreasonable.    Section 124.308(c) would be amended to specify where 8(a) offerings should be sent in light of the changes made by this rule eliminating local and national buy requirements. Under the proposed rule, all requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program as competitive procurements and those sole source requirements that are offered to the program without nominating a specific Program Participant (i.e., open requirements) would be offered to SBA's Division of Program Development in SBA's Central Office. Sole source requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific Program Participant would be offered to the appropriate SBA district office.    Section 124.308(d) would be amended to clarify the distinction between accepting a competitive 8(a) requirement on behalf of the 8(a) program generally and a sole source 8(a) requirement on behalf of a particular 8(a) Program Participant. In addition, the proposed rule would prohibit a procuring agency from conducting a competitive 8(a) requirement prior to obtaining SBA's acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program. Any competition so held would not be considered an 8(a) competition. If a procuring agency still wanted to fulfill its requirement through the 8(a) program, the requirement would have to be offered to and accepted by SBA for the 8(a) program, and the procuring agency would have to use applicable 8(a) competitive procedures after the acceptance. The procuring agency would again be required to synopsize the procurement in the Commerce Business Daily. A new solicitation would have to be issued, and new offers would have to be submitted and evaluated.    Section 124.308 would also be amended, by adding a paragraph (d)(4), to permit all eligible 8(a) concerns nationally to submit offers in connection with 8(a) competitive requirements other than construction requirements.    Sections 124.308(e)(1)(iii), 124.311(f)(4), 124.311(f)(5), 124.312(b), and 124.312(c) would be amended by removing any provisions pertaining to 8(a) support level requirements.    The rule would add a new &sect;124.308(i) pertaining to Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs). This provision would state that each order to be issued under a BOA, and not the BOA itself, is a contracting action. As such, there must be a separate offer and acceptance for each order. As with any other new offer, SBA would determine eligibility for an order under a BOA at the time of the issuance of the order. This would require a concern to remain a small business at the time the order is to be issued and would prohibit orders from being issued to concerns whose program terms have expired or who have otherwise exited the 8(a) program.    Section 124.309(c) would be amended to clarify SBA's intent regarding the concept of adverse impact. Under the proposed rule, ``adverse impact'' could be found to exist where several requirements currently being performed by different small business concerns are bundled into one larger requirement which could be considered ``new'' under SBA's regulations due to the magnitude of the bundled requirement. This rule would permit SBA to find adverse impact in such a case where at least one of the small business concerns losing work that is to be bundles meets the presumption of adverse impact.

text: nullnull      This rule also proposes to amend &sect;124.311(a) concerning how the competitive threshold requirements should be applied for indefinite quantity and indefinite delivery requirements. Currently, &sect;124.311(a)(2) specifies that ``[f]or purposes of indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, the thresholds will be applied to the guaranteed minimum value of the contract.'' This requirement has proven unworkable because of the immense differences noted between the ``guaranteed minimum'' amounts on procurements offered to the 8(a) program and the maximum amounts authorized under the procurements, and has been subject to substantial criticism. Procuring agencies can presently offer very large procurement requirements to the 8(a) program as indefinite quantity type requirements with guaranteed minimum amounts below the applicable 8(a) competitive threshold in order for contracts to be procured on a sole source basis, even though the procurement would likely exceed the applicable competitive threshold during the performance of the contract. Requirements that traditionally were procured through other contract types were being offered and accepted into the 8(a) program as indefinite quantity requirements solely to take advantage of the guaranteed minimum rule. In order to eliminate this potential abuse, SBA proposes to amend its regulations to specify that the competitive threshold requirements would be applied for     all     types of contracts, including indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, to the Government estimate of the requirement, including options, as identified by the procuring agency.    The proposed rule would amend newly redesignated &sect;&sect;124.311(d), (f) and (g) (old &sect;&sect;124.311(e), (h), and (i)) to take into account the proposed change made in &sect;124.308(d)(4) that would permit all eligible Program Participants nationally to submit offers in response to 8(a) competitive solicitations, other than for construction requirements.    Proposed redesignated &sect;124.311(g) (old &sect;124.311(i)) would clarify SBA's implementation of &sect;8(a)(1)(C) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1)(C), which authorizes competitive 8(a) awards in limited circumstances to firms which have completed their terms of participation in the 8(a) program. Of particular note, SBA would specify in the regulations that eligibility would be determined as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers set forth in the solicitation without regard to extensions of time through amendments to the solicitation. The date for determining eligibility would thus be firmly established and could not change during the procurement process. With such a date certain, firms know up front if their program term will expire prior to that specified date. Offers would not be prepared amid uncertainty that the date for determining eligibility could be changed. As such, firms would not be dissuaded from participating in 8(a) competitive procurements during the later stages of their participation terms.    Section 124.317 would be amended to specify that only physical or mental incapacity, and not criminal incarceration or bankruptcy, could be a basis for a waiver of the termination for convenience requirement imposed by this section. In addition, this section would be amended to make clear that the burden is on the concern requesting a waiver to specify the ground(s) upon which the waiver is being sought and to demonstrate that it has met the ground(s). The Agency is not expected to raise every possible basis for waiver and to then dismiss them as not applicable.    The proposed rule would add a new &sect;124.319(c). This provision would clarify that SBA may novate one 8(a) Program Participant for another (with the consent of the procuring agency) where the first concern cannot complete performance of an 8(a) contract, without seeking the approval of the Administrator under &sect;124.317.    Section 124.321(a) would be amended to clarify that an 8(a) concern seeking to joint venture with another firm must bring something of value to the joint venture arrangement other than its status as an 8(a) concern. While the regulation would continue to state that a joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) concern lacks the necessary capacity to perform the contract on its own, it would specify for the first time that where the 8(a) concern lacks the management, technical     and     financial capacity to perform, a joint venture will not be approved. An 8(a) concern may be lacking in one or even two of these areas, but cannot be totally reliant on its proposed joint venture partner. The purpose of permitting joint ventures is to enable an 8(a) firm to gain experience and know-how so that it can become self-reliant in the future. If all an 8(a) concern will gain from the relationship is a profit, without developing its own capabilities in any way, the joint venture will not be approved.    Proposed &sect;124.321(c)(3) would clarify that a joint venture can be made up of two or more 8(a) concerns without any one firm receiving at least 51 percent of the net profits earned by the joint venture. In particular, a 50/50 joint venture arrangement between two 8(a) concerns would be expressly authorized, provided the other regulatory requirements were met.    The rule would make minor clarification changes in &sect;124.321(d) to recognize the possibility of a joint venture made up of two or more 8(a) concerns.    Proposed new &sect;124.321(i) would establish criteria relating to joint ventures for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) set-asides and SDB evaluation preferences. In the past, SBA has held the position that SBA could not establish eligibility criteria relating to joint ventures for the Department of Defense's SDB program. A recent decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims held that ``the power to interpret the term small business concerns .&blank;.&blank;. owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals [for purposes of DOD's SDB program] is wholly and exclusively within the sphere of SBA's authority,'' and that ``SBA has both the power and the duty to define the bounds of [that] phrase.''     Y.S.K. Construction Co., Inc.     v.     United States,     No. 93&hyph;738 at 10, 11 (Fed.Cl. Feb. 18, 1994). This proposed rule attempts to implement that authority in a way that is consistent with the purposes of the SDB program. While the rules vary somewhat from those pertaining to joint ventures in the 8(a) program, the developmental purposes of the 8(a) program are not totally consistent with the purposes of the SDB program. In addition, the rule applies the statutory requirement that the ``majority of the earnings of [an SDB contract] directly accrue to [disadvantaged] individuals.'' Pub. L. 99&hyph;661, Sec. 1207(a)(1). Therefore, although an 8(a) concern that is 51 percent owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals can joint venture with a 100 percent nondisadvantaged concern for a particular 8(a) contract (provided the 8(a) joint venture requirements are met), an SDB concern that is 51 percent owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals cannot joint venture with a 100 percent nondisadvantaged concern for a particular SDB contract. In such a case, a majority of the earnings of the SDB contract could not accrue directly to disadvantaged individuals.    Section 124.501 would be amended by adding a new paragraph ``(c)'' and redesignating current paragraph ``(c)'' as paragraph ``(d).'' The newly established &sect;124.501(c) would require the submission of annual audited financial statements by 8(a) Program Participants.

text: nullnull      This proposed rule would also add a new &sect;124.611 that would make SBA Small Disadvantaged Business status decisions issued pursuant to &sect;7(j)(11)(F)(vii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(11)(F)(vii), available in full text. The decisions would be available for review in the law library located in SBA's central office. This new section would implement the requirements imposed by section 221 of the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;366, 106 Stat. 986, 999.        Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778, and 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), and the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35)        This rule was not reviewed under Executive Order 12866.  SBA certifies that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601,     et seq    . This rule is necessary to resolve several points relating to eligibility for SBA's Section 8(a) program and the procedures relating to appeals of denials of eligibility. It would also clarify/amend the requirements by which an 8(a) concern could obtain an exemption to the Miller Act bond requirements. The contracting opportunities offered to the 8(a) program should not be affected by this proposed rule. Whether a particular 8(a) concern would be eligible for participation in or, once in, could receive a bond exemption (and, therefore, whether it, as opposed to another 8(a) concern, would be awarded a particular 8(a) contract) could be affected by the rule. The rule would have no effect, however, on the amount or dollar value of any contract requirement or the number of such requirements reserved for the 8(a) program. Therefore, it is not likely to have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on competition or the United States economy.    For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35, SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would contain no new reporting or record keeping requirements.    For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule would not have any federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.    For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that this rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.

(a) In order to be eligible to participate in the 8(a) program, an applicant concern and an individual upon whom eligibility is based must meet all of the eligibility criteria set forth in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109. An applicant concern owned and controlled by an Indian tribe must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.112 and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable. An applicant concern owned and controlled by a Native Hawaiian Organization must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.113 and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable. An applicant concern owned and controlled by a Community Development Corporation must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.114 and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable.    (1) An applicant concern's eligibility will be based on whether the concern meets each of SBA's eligibility criteria at the time the concern's completed application for admission to the 8(a) program is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing or, in the case of a request for reconsideration, at the time the reconsideration application is deemed to be complete by SBA's Central Office. SBA, in its sole discretion, may, however, request clarification of information contained in the application or request for reconsideration at any time in the application process.    (i) SBA will consider only additional information submitted by an applicant in response to an SBA request for clarification. Changes in an applicant concern that SBA becomes aware of between the date of application (or request for reconsideration) and the decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD that adversely affect the applicant's eligibility for 8(a) program participation will be considered and constitute grounds for decline.    (ii) The decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program admission shall be based on whether the application, as clarified by any information submitted in response to a request by SBA, demonstrates that the applicant concern complies with each of SBA's eligibility criteria.    (2) All determinations made by the AA/MSB&amp;COD concerning the eligibility of an applicant concern for participation in the 8(a) program shall be in writing, setting forth the findings based on relevant facts and in accordance with applicable law and regulations.    (3) An applicant concern which is declined 8(a) program admission may request a reconsideration of such decline, as set forth in &sect;124.206.    (i) If the application is declined on reconsideration based solely on a negative finding of social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership or control, such decline may be appealed by an unsuccessful applicant to the SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals.    (ii) If no reconsideration is sought, or if after reconsideration the application is declined based in whole or in part on a ground other than a negative finding of social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership or control, the written decline of the AA/MSB&amp;COD is final and not subject to appeal.    (4) The procedures by which an applicant concern may appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's denial of 8(a) program admission to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, and the grounds for which such an appeal may be brought, are set forth in &sect;124.210 and part 134 of this title. Where such an appeal is brought, the written decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be the final Agency decision.

text: nullnull      (a) Ownership of an applicant or 8(a) concern by one or more disadvantaged individuals must be direct ownership.    (1) An applicant concern owned by another business entity that is owned and controlled by one or more disadvantaged individuals does not meet the requirement that it be owned by disadvantaged individuals.    (2) An applicant concern that is owned by a trust which is in turn owned and controlled by a disadvantaged individual does not meet the requirement that it be owned by disadvantaged individuals.        * * * * *        (g) The individuals determined to be disadvantaged in one 8(a) concern, their immediate family members residing in the same household, and the 8(a) concern itself may not hold, in the aggregate, more than a 10 percent equity ownership interest in any other single 8(a) concern.    (h) *&blank;*&blank;*  (i) A non-8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business is prohibited from having an equity ownership interest in an 8(a) concern which exceeds 10 percent, except that a former Program Participant may have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business. *&blank;*&blank;*    (j) *&blank;*&blank;* While SBA approval must be obtained, the substitution of one disadvantaged individual for another disadvantaged individual within an 8(a) concern that was awarded one or more 8(a) contracts does not require termination of those contracts under &sect;124.317 of these regulations or a request for waiver of that termination requirement.    (k) *&blank;*&blank;*   (l) The ownership interests of business concern and its principal(s) are considered to be aggregated in determining whether a non-disadvantaged individual or business concern exceeds the 10 percent equity ownership limitations (or, in the case of a former Program Participant, the 20 percent equity ownership limitations) established by this section and &sect;124.104.    (m) In determining the respective ownership interests in an applicant concern, or in a Program Participant once admitted to the program, SBA considers applicable state community property laws.    (1) In a community property state, even when only one spouse's name appears on a document of title or stock certificate, both spouses are considered to have one-half interest in that property as long as the property is acquired, earned, or accumulated during the course of the marriage.    (2) If SBA determines that the stock or assets of an 8(a) applicant concern are held as community property, and if only one spouse demonstrates disadvantaged status, SBA shall require as a condition of demonstrating or maintaining eligibility, the transfer by the non-disadvantaged spouse or his/her ownership interest to the disadvantaged spouse. Such a transfer must be in an amount sufficient for the disadvantaged spouse to meet the minimum 51% unconditional ownership requirement for 8(a) program eligibility.        Example 1.     Title to 8(a) applicant concern A is 100% in the name of Mrs. X (an individual determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged). Mr. X is a non-disadvantaged individual. Mr. and Mrs. X reside in a community property state and concern A is determined to be community property. By operation of law, Mr. X is deemed to own 50% of concern A. In order to meet 8(a) eligibility requirements, Mr. X would have to transfer 1% of his interest in concern A to Mrs. X as non-community property.        Example 2.     Title to 8(a) applicant B is 51% in the name of Mr. Y (an individual determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged) and 49% in Mr. Z (an unmarried non-disadvantaged individual). Mrs. Y is a non-disadvantaged individual. Mr. and Mrs. Y reside in a community property state and concern B is determined to be community property. By operation of law, Mrs. Y is deemed to own 25.5% of concern B. In order to meet 8(a) eligibility requirements, Mrs. Y would have to transfer all 25.5% of her interest in concern B to Mr. Y as non-community property.    14. Section 124.104 would be amended by revising the introductory text, paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4), paragraph (b), the introductory text of paragraph (c), paragraph (c)(2), and paragraph (d)(3) to read as follows:        &sect;124.104     Control and management.        Except for concerns owned by Indian tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or Community Development Corporations, as defined in &sect;124.100, an applicant concern's management and daily business operations must be conducted by an owner(s) of the applicant concern who has (have) been determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged. (    See     &sect;124.112 for the requirements for tribally-owned entities and those owned by ANCs). In the case of an applicant concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization, the concern's management and daily business operations must be conducted by one or more Native Hawaiian individuals. In the case of a concern owned by a Community Development Corporation, the concern's management and daily business operations must be conducted by one or more individuals determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged. In order for a disadvantaged individual to be found to control the concern, that individual must have managerial or technical experience and competency directly related to the primary industry in which the applicant concern is seeking certification. The application must demonstrate that the applicant concern is actually controlled and managed by one or more individuals determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged. A disadvantaged individual's unexercised right to cause a change in the control or management of the applicant concern does not satisfy this requirement, regardless of how quickly or easily the right could be exercised.

(3) One or more disadvantaged individuals determined to manage the applicant or 8(a) concern on a full-time basis must be present and available during normal working hours at the place of business of the applicant or 8(a) concern.    (4) Any disadvantaged individual upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based who is engaged in the management and daily business operations of the 8(a) concern and who wishes to engage in outside employment must notify SBA of the nature and anticipated duration of the outside employment and obtain the written approval of SBA prior to engaging in such employment. SBA will review any request for outside employment for compliance with the requirement of day-to-day management and control of the 8(a) concern. SBA will deny a request for outside employment which could conflict with the management of the firm or could hinder it in achieving the objectives of its business development plan.    (b) The socially and economically disadvantaged individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based shall control the Board of Directors of an applicant or 8(a) concern, either in actual numbers of voting directors or through weighted voting (e.g., in a concern having a two-person Board of Directors where one individual on the Board is disadvantaged and one is not, the disadvantaged vote must be weighted_worth more than one vote_in order for the concern to be eligible for 8(a) participation).    (1) The powers to appoint, remove, and replace directors (e.g., through ownership of voting stock) is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement that one or more disadvantaged individuals actually control the Board of Directors.    (2) Non-voting, advisory, or honorary Directors may be appointed without affecting the control of the applicant or 8(a) concern to allow the firm to have a varied and experienced Board of Directors, provided they cannot negatively control the concern.    (3) All arrangements regarding the structure and voting rights of the Board of Directors must comply with applicable state law.    (c) Individuals who are not socially and economically disadvantaged may be involved in the management of an 8(a) applicant concern, and may be stockholders, partners, officers, and/or directors of such concern. Such partners, officers, directors, and/or more than 10 percent stockholders of the applicant concern, their spouses or immediate family members who reside in the individual's household may not however:        * * * * *        (2) Have an equity ownership interest of more than 10 percent in an applicant or 8(a) concern where such individual is an officer or director or more than a 20 percent owner, stockholder, or partner of another firm in the same or similar line of business as the applicant or 8(a) concern, except that a principal of a former Program Participant may have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar lines of business as the former Program Participant.        * * * * *          (d) *&blank;*&blank;*    (3) The nondisadvantaged individual or entity provides critical financing or bonding support to the 8(a) concern which directly or indirectly allows the nondisadvantaged individual to gain control or direction of the 8(a) concern.        * * * * *        15. Section 124.105(c)(1) would be amended by redesignating the second sentence and remaining text as paragraph (c)(2) and by revising paragraphs c)(1), introductory text of newly redesignated (c)(2) and newly redesignated paragraph (c)(2)(v) to read as follows:        &sect;124.105      Social disadvantage.        * * * * *        (c)     Individuals not members of designated groups.     (1) An individual who is not a member of one of the groups presumed to be socially disadvantaged in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must establish his/her individual social disadvantage on the basis of clear and convincing evidence.    (2) A clear and convincing case of social disadvantage must include the following elements:        * * * * *        (v) The individual's social disadvantage must have negatively impacted on his or her entry into and/or advancement in the business world. SBA will entertain any relevant evidence in assessing this element. In every case, however, SBA will consider the experiences of the individual, where applicable, in education, employment and business history. Failure to establish disadvantage in any one of these components will not prevent an individual from meeting this requirement as long as the totality of the circumstances experienced by the individual demonstrates his/her disadvantage in entering into and/or advancing in the business world.        * * * * *        16. Section 124.106 would be amended by revising the last sentence of paragraph (a)(1)(i), by changing ``$250,000'' to ``$300,000'' in paragraph (a)(2)(i), by changing ``$750,000'' to ``$900,000'' in paragraph (b)(2), by revising the fifth sentence of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A)(    1    ), by revising paragraph (a)(2)(ii), and by revising paragraph (b)(1), introductory text, to read as follows:        &sect;124.106     Economic disadvantage.

text: nullnull      * * * * *       (ii)     Business financial condition.     This criterion will be used to provide a financial picture of a firm at a specific point in time in comparison to other small concerns in the same business area which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. For purposes of this comparison, concerns in the same business area are those which are primarily engaged in the same four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. SBA will rely on published data showing business and financial profiles of similarly sized businesses operating within the same four-digit SIC code as the applicant, except where such data is not reasonably available. In such a case SBA may rely on published data pertaining to small business concerns in closely related four-digit SIC code(s) to derive the comparative profiles. In evaluating a concern's financial condition, SBA's consideration will include, but not be limited to, the following information: business assets, revenues, pre-tax profit, working capital, and net worth of the concern (including the value of the investments in the concern held by the individual claiming disadvantaged status).        * * * * *        (b) *&blank;*&blank;* (1) For purposes of the section 8(d) Subcontracting Program, Small Disadvantaged Business set-asides, Small Disadvantaged Business Evaluation preferences, and other programs requiring SBA's determination of disadvantaged status, SBA will consider the same information and factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, but will apply standards to each factor that are less restrictive than those applied when determining economic disadvantage for purposes of the 8(a) program. This approach reflects the Congressional intent that partial or complete achievement of a concern's 8(a) program business development goals should not necessarily preclude its participation in other Federal procurement programs for concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.    (2) *&blank;*&blank;*    17. Section 124.107(b) would be revised to read as follows;        &sect;124.107     Potential for success.        * * * * *        (b) In determining whether a concern has the requisite potential for success to be admitted into the 8(a) program, SBA will look at a number of factors including, but not limited to, the technical and managerial experience and competency of the applicant concern's managers and of the concern as a whole, the financial capacity of the applicant concern and the concern's record of performance on previous Federal and private sector contracts in the primary industry in which the concern is seeking 8(a) certification. While the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based need not possess both management and technical capabilities pursuant to &sect;124.104, the applicant concern as a whole must demonstrate both technical know-how in the primary industry in which the concern is seeking 8(a) certification and management experience sufficient to run its day-to-day operations. SBA will examine each of these factors to determine whether an otherwise eligible applicant concern has the potential to successfully perform subcontracts awarded under the 8(a) program and to meet the business development objectives and goals of the program.        * * * * *        18. Section 124.108 would be amended by adding the following new paragraph (d)(3):        &sect;124.108     Additional 8(a) program eligibility requirements.        * * * * *        (d) *&blank;*&blank;*    (3) An applicant concern seeking admission to the 8(a) program as a regular dealer need not demonstrate that it is capable of meeting the requirements of the non-manufacturer rule (    see     13 CFR 121.1106(b)) for its primary industry classification.        * * * * *        19. Section 124.109 would be amended by revising paragraphs (d) and (e), and by adding a new paragraph (f), to read as follows:        &sect;124.109     Ineligible businesses.        * * * * *        (d)     Non-profit organizations.     A non-profit organization does not meet the general definition of a concern as set forth in part 121 and &sect;124.100 of these regulations and is, therefore, ineligible for 8(a) program participation. In addition, a business entity owned by a non-profit organization is not eligible for 8(a) program participation because such a concern does not meet the requirement of being owned and controlled by disadvantaged     individuals.     Nothing in this paragraph affects the eligibility of a for-profit concern owned and controlled by an Indian tribe, including an Alaskan Native Corporation, a Native Hawaiian Organization or a Community Development Corporation (    see     &sect;&sect;124.112, 124.113, and 124.114).    (e)     Concerns owned by other concerns.     An 8(a) applicant concern which is owned by another business concern, even where that ``parent'' concern is itself owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals, may not be admitted to the 8(a) program because the applicant concern would not be owned by disadvantaged individuals. Nothing in this section is intended to affect the eligibility of joint ventures for specific 8(a) procurement requirements that are authorized pursuant to &sect;124.321.    (f)     Parole or probation.     An applicant to the 8(a) program is ineligible for program participation if the proprietor, or a holder of at least 20 percent of the stock, or a partner, officer, director, or other persons, including hired managers, who have or will have the authority to speak for and commit the concern in the management of its business affairs, is currently incarcerated, on parole or on probation either pursuant to a pre-trial diversion or following conviction of a serious offense.    20. Section 124.110 would be amended by revising the first three sentences of paragraph (a) and by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows:        &sect;124.110     Program term.        (a) Each concern certified for participation in the 8(a) program shall receive a Program Term of nine years from the date of such certification. The term will consist of two stages: the developmental stage, which lasts four years, and the transitional stage, which lasts five years. These stages are described in &sect;124.303. *&blank;*&blank;*    (b) Once a Program Term has been established in accordance with this section, SBA is statutorily prohibited from extending such term beyond the specified expiration date.

(a)&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*  (2) In order for a Program Participant to maintain continued 8(a) program eligibility, the net worth of an individual claiming to be socially and economically disadvantaged cannot exceed $900,000, as calculated pursuant to &sect;124.106(a)(2)(i). An individual whose personal net worth exceeds $900,000, as calculated pursuant to &sect;124.106(a)(2)(i), will not be considered economically disadvantaged.      * * * * *      (c)&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*  (5) If SBA determines, pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, that funds or assets have been withdrawn to the detriment of the achievement of the targets, objectives and goals of the Participant's business plan, or to the detriment of its overall business development, SBA shall initiate a termination proceeding under &sect;124.209 or shall require an appropriate reinvestment of funds or other assets and such other actions as SBA may deem necessary to counteract the detrimental withdrawals as a condition of maintaining 8(a) program eligibility. The mere fact that a concern's net worth has increased despite withdrawals that are deemed excessive will not preclude SBA from determining that such withdrawals were detrimental to the attainment of the concern's business objectives or to its overall business development.      * * * * *      22.

The particular size standard to be applied shall be based on the primary industry classification of the applicant concern. Ownership by the Native Hawaiian Organization will not, in and of itself, cause affiliation with the Native Hawaiian Organization or with other entities owned by the Native Hawaiian Organization. However, affiliation with the Native Hawaiian Organization or with other entities owned by the Native Hawaiian Organization may be caused by circumstances other than common ownership.  (c) No Native Hawaiian Organization shall own more than one current or former 8(a) Program Participant having the same primary industry classification.

Such concerns must meet all eligibility criteria set forth in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 and &sect;124.111(a) of this part.  (b) A concern owned by a CDC must qualify as a small business concern as defined for purposes of Government procurement in part 121 of this title. The particular size standard to be applied shall be based on the primary industry classification of the applicant concern. Ownership by the CDC will not, in and of itself, cause affiliation with the CDC or with other CDC-owned entities. However, affiliation with the CDC or other CDC-owned entities may be caused by circumstances other than common CDC ownership.  (c) No CDC shall own more than one current or former 8(a) Program Participant having the same primary industry classification.

If the grounds for the proposed termination continue to exist, the Division Director shall recommend in writing to the AA/MSB&amp;COD that the Participant be terminated.      * * * * *      30. Section 124.210 would be amended by revising paragraph (h)(2) and adding the following new paragraph (k) at the end as follows:      &sect;124.210    Appeals to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals.      * * * * *      (h)(1) *&blank;*&blank;*  (2) If the Administrative Law Judge determines that, due to the absence in the written administrative record of the reasons upon which the determination in question was based, such administrative record is insufficiently complete to decide whether the determination is arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law, the case shall be remanded by the Administrative Law Judge to the AA/MSB&amp;COD for further consideration in accordance with the terms of such remand. The AA/MSB&amp;COD shall issue a revised decision in accordance with the remand order within 10 working days of the remand, unless the AA/MSB&amp;COD requests and the Administrative Law Judge grants an extension thereof. An applicant or 8(a) concern may appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's remand decision to OHA within 20 working days of the date that the decision is mailed. The failure of an applicant to file an appeal within the 20-day time frame would serve to make the remand decision the final agency decision and would not require any further action by OHA.  (3)(i) *&blank;*&blank;*  (k)(1) At any time after a written decision has been issued and upon notice to all parties to the proceeding, the Administrative Law Judge may, on his/her own initiative, reopen the proceeding and enter a new decision confirming, modifying, or setting aside the decision in whole or in part.  (2) Within 20 calendar days after the issuance of a written decision and upon notice to all parties to the proceeding, any party may file a petition for reconsideration of such decision. Such a petition may be granted only where it establishes a clear error of law or fact of decisional significance.  31. Section 124.302 would be amended by revising paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) and (c)(2) to read as follows:      &sect;124.302    Review and modification of business plan.      * * * * *      (c)     Changes in SIC code designations    .

(2) The SIC code assigned to a sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement may not be challenged by another Program Participant or any other party to SBA or to any other administrative forum as part of a bid or other contract protest. Pursuant to &sect;121.1703(b), only the AA/MSB&amp;COD may appeal a SIC code designation with respect to a sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement, and such appeal, if initiated in the discretion of the AA/MSB&amp;COD, shall be made to OHA.  (3) Anyone with information concerning the eligibility of a Program Participant to continue participation in the 8(a) program may submit such information to SBA in accordance with &sect;124.111(c). Similarly, anyone with information concerning the size eligibility of a Program Participant for purposes of a specific 8(a) contract may submit such information to the appropriate SBA field office for consideration.     See     &sect;&sect;121.1104(b)&hyph;(d).           37. Section 124.308 would be amended by revising the introductory text of paragraph (c), revising paragraph (d), the first sentence of paragraph, (f)(1), paragraph (f)(2), the first sentence of paragraph (g), and by adding a new paragraph (i), to read as follows:        &sect;124.308     Procedures for obtaining and accepting procurements for the 8(a) program.        * * * * *      (c)     Offering letter.     All requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program as competitive procurements and those sole source requirements that are offered to the program without nominating a specific Program Participant (i.e., open requirements) should be offered to SBA's Division of Program Development, 409 Third Street SW., Washington, DC 20416. Sole source requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific Program Participant should be offered to the appropriate SBA district office. When a requirement is offered to the 8(a) program, the offering letter or notification from the procuring agency shall contain the following information:      * * * * *      (d)     Acceptance of the requirement.     Upon receipt of the procuring agency's offer of a procurement requirement, SBA will determine whether it will accept the requirement for the 8(a) program. SBA's decision whether to accept the requirement will be transmitted to the procuring agency in writing within 15 working days of receipt of the written offering letter, unless SBA requests, and the procuring agency grants, an extension. SBA is not required to accept any particular procurement offered to the 8(a) program.    (1) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a sole source 8(a) procurement, SBa will accept the offer both on behalf of the program and in support of the approved business plan of a specific 8(a) Program Participant.    (2) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a competitive 8(a) procurement, SBA will accept the offer for the 8(a) program generally.    (3) SBA will not accept a requirement as a competitive 8(a) procurement where a competition has been conducted by a procuring agency prior to SBA's formal acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program and the procuring agency seeks SBA's acceptance in order to select an apparent successful offeror and/or transmit a contract to SBA for execution. Such a competition conducted without obtaining SBA's formal acceptance of the procurement requirement for the 8(a) program will not be considered an 8(a) competitive requirement. In such a case, SBA may accept the requirement for the 8(a) program as a competitive 8(a) requirement, but the procuring agency would be required to use appropriate competition procedures again, including issuing a new solicitation.    (4) Except for requirements assigned a construction SIC code by the procuring agency contracting officer, all competitive 8(a) requirements accepted by SBA may be competed among all eligible 8(a) Program Participants nationally. The only geographic restrictions pertaining to 8(a) competitive requirements, other than those for construction requirements, would be those imposed by the solicitations themselves.        * * * * *      (f)     Open requirements.     *&blank;*&blank;*  (1) If the procurement is a construction requirement, SBA will examine the portfolio of 8(a) concerns for the SBA district office where the work is to be performed for selection of a qualified 8(a) concern. *&blank;*&blank;*    (2) If the procurement is anything other than a construction requirement, SBA may select any eligible, responsible Program Participant nationally to perform the contract.

Except for the procedures prescribed by subpart 36.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations for architect-engineer services, SBA will not authorize formal technical evaluations for sole source 8(a) procurement requirements. *&blank;*&blank;*      * * * * *      (i)     Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).     (1) For purposes of the 8(a) program, a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) is not an 8(a) contract award. Each order to be issued under the BOA is an individual contract. As such, there must be a separate offer and acceptance of each BOA order before it may be issued through the 8(a) program as an 8(a) contract award. The 8(a) Participant must be eligible to receive each new order at the time of the order. For example, a concern's size status does not relate back to the time that the BOA was executed. Instead, a concern must be small at the time of the issuance of each new order.  (2) Once a concern's term of program participation expires, or the concern otherwise exits the 8(a) program, new orders cannot be issued through the 8(a) program because the concern is no longer eligible to receive new 8(a) awards.      &sect;124.308    [Amended]      38. Section 124.308 would be further amended by removing the words ``approved 8(a) business support level or the'' contained in paragraph (e)(1)(iii).           39. Section 124.309(c) would be revised to read as follows:      &sect;124.309    Barriers to acceptance.      * * * * *      (c)     Adverse Impact.     SBA has made a written determination that acceptance of the procurement for 8(a) award would have an adverse impact on an individual small business, a group of small businesses located in a specific geographical location, or other small business programs. The adverse impact concept is designed to protect small business concerns which are performing or are seeking to perform Government contracts awarded outside the 8(a) program.  (1) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on an individual small business, SBA will consider all relevant factors.  (i) In connection with an individual small business, SBA presumes adverse impact to exist when a small business concern has performed a specific requirement for at least 24 months, it is performing the requirement at the time it is offered to the 8(a) program or its performance of the requirement ended within 30 days of the procuring agency's offer of the requirement to the 8(a) program, and the dollar value of the requirement that the small business was performing is 25 percent or more of its most recent annual gross sales (including those of its affiliates).  (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adverse impact does not apply to ``new'' requirements. A new requirement is a requirement which has not been previously procured by the relevant procuring agency. Where a requirement is new, no small business could have performed the requirement and, thus, an impact determination need not be performed. Construction contracts by their very nature (e.g., the one-time building of a specific structure) are new requirements. The expansion or alteration of an existing requirement shall be considered a new requirement where the requirement is materially expanded or modified so that the ensuing requirement is not substantially similar to the prior requirement due to the magnitude of the expansion or alteration.  (2) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on a group of small businesses located in a specific geographical location, SBA shall consider the effects of a procuring agency bundling various requirements being performed by two or more small business concerns into a larger contract which would be considered a ``new'' requirement because of the magnitude of its expansion as compared to any of the previous smaller requirements. In such a case, adverse impact may be found if one of the small business concerns meets the presumption set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.  (3) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on other small business programs, SBA will consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to, whether or not SBA's acceptance of a proposed 8(a) requirement is likely to result in SBA taking an inordinate portion of total procurements in the subject industry to the detriment of the small business set-aside program.      &sect;124.309    [Amended]      40. Section 124.309 would be further amended by revising the phrase ``a sole source 8(a) contract'' in paragraph (d) to read ``an 8(a) contract.''  41. Section 124.311(a)(2) is amended by removing the following sentence from the end:  ``For purposes of indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, the thresholds will be applied to the guaranteed minimum value of the contract.''  42. Section 124.311 would be further amended by removing paragraphs (b) and (g), by redesignating paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (h) and (i) as paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g), respectively, by adding a new paragraph (a)(3), and by revising newly redesignated paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (f)(3), (f)(4), and (g) to read as follows:

(2) For purposes of any requirement other than a construction requirement, SBA will accept a contract opportunity above the applicable competitive threshold as a sole source 8(a) requirement only if there are not two eligible offerors in the United States capable of performing the requirement at a fair price.        * * * * *        (f)     Restricted competition.

Where a construction requirement offered to the 8(a) program exceeds the $3 million competitive threshold, SBA will determine, based on its knowledge of the 8(a) portfolio, whether the competition should be limited only to those Program Participants located within the geographical boundaries of one or more SBA district offices, an entire SBA regional office, or adjacent SBA regional offices. Only those Participants located within the appropriate geographical boundaries are eligible to submit offers.    (4)     Competition for all non-construction requirements.     Except for construction requirements, all eligible Program Participants nationally may submit offers in response to solicitations for procurement requirements offered to the 8(a) program that exceed the applicable competitive threshold.    (g)     Award to firms whose program terms have expired.     A concern that has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) program, as set forth in &sect;124.110, may be awarded a competitive 8(a) contract if it was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation.    (1) For a negotiated procurement, so long as a Program Participant is eligible as of the date specified for the receipt of offers in the solicitation, its program term may expire after that date without affecting the concern's eligibility to submit revised offers, including a best and final offer, and receive a competitive award.    (2) Eligibility is determined as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers set forth in the solicitation without regard to extensions of time through amendments to the solicitation.    (3) This provision applies equally to all 8(a) procurement requirements, including construction requirements.    (4) An 8(a) procurement requirement for architect-engineer services, in an amount less than the competitive threshold set forth in &sect;124.311(a), that uses the evaluation procedures prescribed by subpart 36.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation will not be considered a competitive 8(a) requirement under this section for which a firm whose program term has expired may be eligible.           43. Section 124.311 would be further amended by removing the phrase ``business support level and'' in newly redesignated paragraph (e)(4), by adding the word ``and'' after the semi-colon (``;'') in newly redesignated paragraph (e)(5)(iii), by removing newly redesignated paragraph (e)(5)(iv) in its entirety, by redesignating paragraph (e)(5)(v) as paragraph (e)(5)(iv), and by revising newly redesignated paragraph (e)(5)(iv) to read as follows:        &sect;124.311     8(a) competition.        * * * * *        (e) *&blank;*&blank;*    (5) *&blank;*&blank;*        * * * * *        (iv) If the firm is in the transitional stage of program participation, whether it has achieved its competitive business mix targets under &sect;124.312, or is in compliance with a remedial plan that does not include the denial of future 8(a) contracts.        &sect;124.312     [Amended]        44.

(a)     Prerequisites for joint venture agreement. *&blank;*&blank;*     A joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) concern lacks the necessary capacity to perform the contract on its own, and when the agreement is fair and equitable.

(3) Accounting and other administrative records relating to the joint venture shall be kept in the office of the lead 8(a) concern, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is granted by SBA upon written request. Upon completion of the contract performed by the joint venture, the final original records shall be retained by the lead 8(a) concern.        * * * * *      (h)     Joint ventures with concerns owned by Indian tribes.

Joint ventures are permitted for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) set-asides and SDB evaluation preferences, provided that the requirements set forth in this paragraph are met.    (1) For purposes of this paragraph, the term joint venture has the same meaning as that set forth in &sect;121.401(1) of these regulations. Two or more concerns that form an ongoing relationship to conduct business would not be considered ``joint venturers'' within the meaning of this paragraph, and would also not be eligible as an entity owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.    (2) A concern that is owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals entering into a joint venture agreement with one or more other business concerns is considered to be affiliated for size purposes with such other concern(s). The combined annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint venture must meet the applicable size standard corresponding to the SIC code designated for the contract.    (3) The majority of the venture's earnings must accrue directly to the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the SDB concern(s) in the joint venture.    (4) The percentage ownership involvement in a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals must be at least 51 percent.        Example 1.     Small business concern A is 100% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern B is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged individuals. The percentage involvement by concern A in a joint venture between A and B must be at least 51%.        Example 2.     Small business concern C is 51% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern D is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged individuals. Any joint venture between C and D would be ineligible because the amount of ownership involvement in such a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals would be less than 51%. Even a 90% involvement by concern C in a joint venture with D would mean an overall ownership involvement by disadvantaged individuals of only 45.9% (51% of 90), and an overall ownership involvement by nondisadvantaged individuals of 54.1% (10 + (49% of 90)).           49.

(2) Program Participants with actual gross annual receipts of $1,000,000 to $4,999,999 shall submit to SBA reviewed annual financial statements prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in part 107, Appendix I, &para; II. B) within 90 days after the close of concern's fiscal year.  (3) Program Participants with actual gross annual receipts of less than $1,000,000 shall submit to SBA an annual statement prepared in-house or compilation statement prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in part 107, Appendix I, &para; II.

(4) Any audited financial statements submitted to SBA pursuant to &sect;124.501(c) shall be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and reflect the independent public accountant's opinion.  (5) While financial statements need not be submitted until 90 or 120 days after the close of an 8(a) concern's fiscal year, depending on the receipts of the concern, every 8(a) concern must submit a final sales report signed by the CEO or President to SBA within 10 working days of the end of its fiscal year in order for SBA to determine/verify the concern's size for 8(a) contract awards and compliance with competitive business mix targets. This report must show a breakdown of 8(a) and non-8(a) sales.  (6) Audited or reviewed annual and/or quarterly statements may be required when SBA determines it is necessary to obtain a more thorough verification of a concern's assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses, or to determine the concern's capacity to perform a specific 8(a) contract.

text: nullnull      Petitions for Rulemaking            Docket No.:      27817        Petitioner:      Mr. Danilo Floreani        Regulations Affected:      14 CFR 61.197        Description of Rulechange Sought:      To allow a Certified Flight Instructor renewal to be granted to a military pilot with a favorable record of instruction, or to a military flight examiner.        Petitioner's Reason for the Request:      The petitioner states that there is no provision for renewal of the CFI certificate based on instruction given during military operations. The petitioner further states that the FARs are clear in referring to the practices of ``company'' check airmen, but make no distinction between check airmen for the airline industry and check airmen for the military. The petitioner feels that the military aviation experience is credible, professional, and respected in the aviation industry and should be acknowledged with full credit.               Docket No.:      27830        Petitioner:      Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association        Sections of the FAR Affected:      14 CFR 43.15(c), 65.85, 65.87, 65.95(a)(2), and 91.409(a)        Description of Rulechange Sought:      To establish an alternative or parallel path for aircraft inspection that would extend the existing annual inspection requirement to 2 years or 200 hours, whichever comes first, for all aircraft in non-commercial service for whom such a program would be advantageous. Additionally, the petitioner proposes that all such aircraft engaged in the biennial inspection program would be subject to a periodic, clearly defined, mandatory field service and be returned to service by an appropriately rated Aviation Maintenance Technician at intervals not to exceed the lesser of 50 flight hours or 6 calendar months. Operators who typically fly their aircraft more than 200 hours in a 2 year period for whom this proposed change would not most likely be economically advantageous, could continue to operate under the annual inspection program currently prescribed to operate under the annual inspection program currently prescribed under &sect;91.409(a).        Petitioner's Reason for the Request:      The petitioner believes that the existing mandatory annual inspection interval does not adequately address the true maintenance needs of the general aviation fleet and, in its view, misdirects millions of maintenance dollars annually. The petitioner further believes that tailoring the regulatory maintenance and inspection requirements to better suit the needs of general aviation, as proposed by its petition, would enhance aviation safety, better preserve the general aviation fleet through improved ongoing maintenance, and save aircraft owners a percentage of the onerous cost of annual inspections.

text:   SUMMARY:     This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require repetitive inspections to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors, and correction of discrepancies, if necessary. This proposal would also require replacement of the shouldered bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. This proposal is prompted by a report that, during an emergency evacuation of in-service airplanes, the left aft passenger/crew door jammed against the fuselage structure in a nearly closed position due to bushing migration. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency.

Discussion       The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC advises that, during an emergency evacuation of an in-service airplane, the left aft passenger/crew door jammed against the fuselage structure in a nearly closed position. Investigation revealed the bushing of the lower connection link had migrated. The cause of this migration has been attributed to the seizing of the upper locking hook into its bronze bushing from the frame segment at the level of the door lifting bellcranks. This condition, if not corrected, could result in jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency.   Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1047, dated April 25, 1994, which describes procedures for:   1. Performing repetitive detailed visual inspections to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors;   2.

text: nullnull      Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1027, Revision 3, dated December 10, 1993, which describes procedures for replacing the shouldered bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which will prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door.    The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;207&hyph;048(B), dated December 8, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.    This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.    Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors, and correction of discrepancies, if necessary. The proposed AD would also require replacement of the shouldered bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. Correction of certain discrepancies would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by the FAA.    The FAA estimates that 99 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take approximately 72 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $392,040, or $3,960 per airplane.    It would take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,670, or $330 per airplane.    Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $424,710, or $4,290 per airplane.    The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.    The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.    For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption     addresses.

text:   SUMMARY:     This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system with new, improved actuators. This proposal is prompted by reports indicating that the requirements of a previously issued AD do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly   jeopardize successful emergency evacuation of an airplane.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Comments Invited         Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received.     Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,   environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket.     Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments   submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs     Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion     On July 15, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327 (57 FR   47987, October 21, 1992), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 and Model 767 series airplanes. That AD requires repetitive inspections (weighing program) of the door opening/snubbing actuators of the escape system (for Model 747 series airplanes) and the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape slide (for Model 767 series airplanes), and modification of the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment.     Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report from an operator of Model 767 series airplanes that several actuators leaked following accomplishment of the modification procedures required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the modification requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators.     Additionally, this operator also reported that, during subsequent inspections (weighing program) of these actuators, the weight in several actuators increased from the original weight measured during the initial inspection (weighing program) required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA finds that the inspection requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 cannot reliably determine the fluid level of these actuators by the weighing program.     Further, since the issuance of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, the manufacturer has developed a new, improved actuator for Model 767 series airplanes. These new actuators are not fluid-filled. The old actuators were fluid-filled and had a tendency to leak, which caused the actuator to fail.                 14 CFR Part 39         <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD] </RINDOCK>        Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes Equipped With Off-Wing Escape Slides        <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.        </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).           </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments   submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs     Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion     On July 15, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327 (57 FR   47987, October 21, 1992), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 and Model 767 series airplanes. That AD requires repetitive inspections (weighing program) of the door opening/snubbing actuators of the escape system (for Model 747 series airplanes) and the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape slide (for Model 767 series airplanes), and modification of the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment.     Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report from an operator of Model 767 series airplanes that several actuators leaked following accomplishment of the modification procedures required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the modification requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators.     Additionally, this operator also reported that, during subsequent inspections (weighing program) of these actuators, the weight in several actuators increased from the original weight measured during the initial inspection (weighing program) required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA finds that the inspection requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 cannot reliably determine the fluid level of these actuators by the weighing program.     Further, since the issuance of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, the manufacturer has developed a new, improved actuator for Model 767 series airplanes. These new actuators are not fluid-filled. The old actuators were fluid-filled and had a tendency to leak, which caused the actuator to fail.     </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      Failure of the door opening/snubbing actuator, if not corrected, could result in the escape slide failing to deploy, which could delay and possibly jeopardize the successful emergency evacuation of an airplane.   The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25&hyph;0216, dated February 3, 1994, which describes procedures for replacement of currently installed door opening actuators of the off-wing emergency escape system with new, improved actuators.   Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system on Model 767 series airplanes with new, improved actuators. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.   The requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 to inspect the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape slide, and modify and inspect the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment of Model 767 series airplanes have been retained in this proposal. However, accomplishment of the proposed actuator replacement would constitute terminating action for those requirements. Accordingly, the FAA will, in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 to remove these requirements for Model 767 series airplanes from that AD.   There are approximately 460 Boeing Model 767 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 173 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.   The inspections and modification currently required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, and retained in this proposal, take approximately 12 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts cost approximately $510 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspections and modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $146,250, or $1,170 per airplane.   The proposed replacement would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $6,400 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed replacement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,126,230, or $6,510 per airplane.   The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.   The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those   costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.   A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary.   The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.   For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility   Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``    ADDRESSES    .''

Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:                Boeing: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD.             Applicability:     Model 767 series airplanes equipped with off-wing escape slides, certificated in any category.         Compliance:     Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.     To prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly jeopardize successful emergency evacuation of an airplane, accomplish the following:     (a) Within 18 months after November 25, 1992 (the effective date of AD   92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327), inspect the off-wing escape slide door opening/snubbing actuators in accordance with OEA Service Bulletin 3092100&hyph;25&hyph;002, dated July 26, 1991. Repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 20 months until the replacement required by paragraph (c) is accomplished. For operators that have previously accomplished this inspection in accordance with AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17: This paragraph requires that the next scheduled inspection be performed within 20 months after the last   inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17.     (b) Within 18 months after November 25, 1992 (the effective date of AD   92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327), inspect and modify the escape slide compartment door latching mechanism in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25A0174, dated August 15, 1991. Accomplishment of the actions required by this paragraph prior to the effective date of this AD terminates the actions required by paragraph (b)(2) of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17.     (c) Within 2 years after the effective date of this AD, replace the currently installed door opening actuator of the emergency off-wing escape system with a new, improved actuator, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25&hyph;0216, dated February 3, 1994. Accomplishment of this replacement terminates the repetitive inspection requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD.     (d) As of 2 years after the effective date of this AD, only door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system having OEA part number 5262100 (Boeing part number 5416T208&hyph;12) shall be installed on any airplane.     (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO.               Note:     Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO.           (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

text:   SUMMARY:     We are proposing to update our rules on the need for and use of employer identification numbers and on processing reports of wages provided annually by employers to the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, we are proposing to add to our rules the procedures we have for maintaining and providing information we receive from employers on deterred vested pension benefits.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           Employer Identification Numbers        SSA maintains a record of the wages and self-employment income of each individual. The record includes earnings covered under title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), earnings covered under title XVIII of the Act, and earnings not covered under the Act. The record is identified by the individual's social security number. Wages posted to an individual's record are based on wage reports submitted to SSA and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by employers. IRS regulations at 26 CFR 31.6011(a)&hyph;1 require an employer to file employment tax returns with IRS each year and IRS regulations at 26 CFR 31.6051&hyph;2 and 31.6091&hyph;1(d) require an employer to file wage reports with SSA each year. These requirements are also explained on wage reporting forms and in related instructions issued by SSA and IRS. To help account for these returns and reports, IRS assigns an employer identification number (EIN) to every employer. However, SSA will assign a special identification number to one or more political subdivisions of a State which submits a modification to its coverage agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under section 218 of the Act. These numbers are assigned only for State bookkeeping purposes unless coverage is extended to periods prior to 1987. Then, the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained.        Annual Wage Reporting        Section 232 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 432, was added by section 8 of Public Law 94&hyph;202. Section 8 is cited as the ``Combined Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance-Income Tax Reporting Amendments of 1975.'' Section 232 provides authority for the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of HHS to make available such documents that are agreed upon as being necessary for processing information contained in returns required by the Internal Revenue Code and by IRS regulations. Under this authority and Pub. L. 94&hyph;455 and 95&hyph;216, SSA and IRS have entered into an Agreement governing the manner in which employer wage reports will be processed. Included in this process are the wage reports which employers are required to file annually with SSA. As required by IRS regulations at 26 CFR 301.6011&hyph;2, employers who file 250 or more wage reports per year must file them on magnetic media, unless the requirement is waived by IRS. These proposed regulations reflect these requirements for filing annual wage reports with SSA and explain how SSA will process the reports and reconcile reporting errors with IRS, employees, and employers.        Incorrect Wage Reports        We are also proposing to consolidate &sect;&sect;  422.115 and 422.120 to include in one section (proposed &sect;422.120) our current procedures for processing wage reports, submitted to us by employers, that do not include a worker's social security number or include an incorrect name or number. The existing regulations provide that we will first contact the employer for the missing information or correction. However, in the proposed regulation, we state our current procedure which is to attempt to contact the employee first. Additionally, we provide that we may return to the employer a wage report submittal if 90 percent or more of the wage reports are unidentified or incorrectly identified. We also explain in the proposed &sect;422.120 that we will inform IRS of all wage reports filed with SSA that do not include the required social security numbers. IRS may then assess the employer a penalty for erroneous report filing, pursuant to the authority provided in section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6721.        Pension Plan Information        Under section 6057 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6057, certain private pension plan administrators must file with the IRS annual reports that identify individuals who separated from plan coverage during the year and still have a right to future retirement benefits. In addition, this provision of the Internal Revenue Code provides for transmitting copies of the annual reports to the Secretary of HHS. The copies are forwarded to SSA and transcribed onto an electronic record for the purpose of maintaining the pension information which SSA must provide to specified individuals, as explained below.    Section 1131 of the Act requires that whenever the Secretary of HHS makes a finding of fact and a decision as to the entitlement of an individual to social security or medicare benefits under title II of the Act or is requested to do so, the Secretary must transmit to the individual any information, as reported by the employer, regarding any deferred vested benefits under a private pension plan. In these proposed rules, we explain how we administer this provision.                             <USBUREAU>Social Security Administration</USBUREAU>        20 CFR Parts 404 and 422          <RINDOCK>RIN 0960&hyph;AD70</RINDOCK>        Wage Reports and Pension Information       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Social Security Administration, HHS.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Proposed rules.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     We are proposing to update our rules on the need for and use of employer identification numbers and on processing reports of wages provided annually by employers to the Social Security Administration (SSA).

text: nullnull      Regulatory Procedures        Executive Order 12866        We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review.        Regulatory Flexibility Act        We certify that these proposed rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the procedures stated in these rules are already in effect without having caused a significant impact. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.        Paperwork Reduction Act        These proposed rules contain reporting requirements in &sect;&sect;422.114 (e) and (f) and 422.120(a). We would normally seek approval of these requirements, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We are not doing so in this situation because we already have clearance from OMB to collect this information using forms SSA&hyph;L93, 95 and 97 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0432) and form SSA&hyph;2765 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0694).    There is also a reporting requirement in &sect;422.122, which deals with information on deferred vested pension benefits. As required by section 2(a) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), we will submit a copy to OMB for its review of this information collection requirement. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on these information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Office Building, Room 3208, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for HHS.    Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 30 minutes per response.

text: nullnull      For the reasons set out in the preamble, we are proposing to amend subpart M of part 404 and subpart B of part 422 of 20 CFR chapter III as follows:        PART 404_FEDERAL OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE (1950&hyph;&blank;&blank;)        1. The authority citation for subpart M of part 404 continues to read as follows:               Authority:     Secs. 205, 210, 218, and 1102 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 405, 410, 418, and 1302; sec. 12110 of Public Law 99&hyph;272, 100 Stat. 287; sec. 9002 of Public Law 99&hyph;509, 100 Stat. 1970.           2. Section 404.1220 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (e) to read as follows:        &sect;404.1220    Identification numbers.        (a)     State and local government    . When a State submits a modification to its agreement with the Secretary under section 218 of the Act, SSA will assign a special identification number to each political subdivision included in that modification. SSA will inform the State of the special identification number(s) by sending a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD, ``Notice of Identifying Number,'' to the State. These numbers are assigned only for State bookkeeping purposes unless coverage is extended to periods prior to 1987. Then, the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained and SSA will send a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD to the interstate instrumentality to notify it of the number assigned.        * * * * *        (e)     Use    . For wages paid prior to 1987, the employer shall show the appropriate SSA-issued identifying number, including any coverage group or payroll record unit number, on records, reports, returns, and claims to report wages, adjustments, and contributions.        PART 422_ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES        1. The authority citation for subpart B of part 422 is revised to read as follows:               Authority:     Secs, 205, 232, 1102, 1131, and 1143 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 405, 432, 1302, 1320b&hyph;1, and 1320b&hyph;13.           2. Section 422.112 is revised to read as follows:        &sect;422.112    Employer identification numbers.        (a)     General    . Most employers are required by &sect;6109 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6109) and by Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations at 26 CFR 31.6011(b)&hyph;1 to obtain an employer identification number (EIN) and to include it on wage reports filed with SSA. A sole proprietor who does not pay wages to one or more employees or who is not required to file any pension or excise tax return is not subject to this requirement. To apply for an EIN, employers file Form SS&hyph;4, ``Application for Employer Identification Number,'' with the IRS. For the convenience of employers, Form SS&hyph;4 is available at all SSA and IRS offices. Household employers, agricultural employers, and domestic corporations which elect social security coverage for employees of foreign subsidiaries who are citizens or residents of the U.S. may be assigned an EIN by IRS without filing an SS&hyph;4.

text: nullnull      (b)     State and local governments.     To facilitate a State's bookkeeping, SSA will assign a special identification number to each political subdivision included in a modification to the State's agreement with the Secretary under section 218 of the Act. These numbers are not used for reporting purposes unless coverage is extended to periods prior to 1987. Then, the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. This special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained. SSA will inform the appropriate State or interstate instrumentality official of the assigned number by sending a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD, ``Notice of Identifying Number.''           3. A new &sect;422.114 is added to read as follows:        &sect;422.114     Annual wage reporting process.        (a)     General.     Under the authority of section 232 of the Act, SSA and IRS have entered into an agreement that sets forth the manner by which SSA and IRS will ensure that the processing of employee wage reports is effective and efficient. Under this agreement, employers are instructed by IRS to file annual wage reports with SSA on paper Forms W&hyph;2, ``Wage and Tax Statement,'' and Forms W&hyph;3, ``Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements,'' or equivalent   W&hyph;2 and W&hyph;3 magnetic media reports. Special versions of these forms for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are also filed with SSA. SSA processes all wage reporting forms for updating to SSA's earnings records and IRS tax records, identifies employer reporting errors and untimely filed forms for IRS penalty assessment action, and takes action to correct any reporting errors identified, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. SSA also processes Forms W&hyph;3c, ``Transmittal of Corrected Income Tax Statement,'' and W&hyph;2c, ``Statement of Corrected Income and Tax Amounts'' (and their magnetic media equivalents) that employers are required to file with SSA when certain previous reporting errors are discovered.    (b)     Magnetic media reporting requirements.     Under IRS regulations at 26 CFR 301.6011&hyph;2, employers who file 250 or more W&hyph;2 wage reports per year must file them on magnetic media in accordance with requirements provided in SSA publications, unless IRS grants the employer a waiver. Basic SSA requirements are set out in SSA's Technical Instruction Bulletin No. 4, ``Magnetic Media Reporting.'' Special filing requirements for U.S. territorial employers are set out in SSA Technical Instruction Bulletins No. 5 (Puerto Rico), No. 6 (Virgin Islands), and No. 7 (Guam and American Samoa). At the end of each year, SSA mails these technical instructions to employers (or third parties who file wage reports on their behalf) for their use in filing wage reports for that year.    (c)     Processing late and incorrect magnetic media wage transmittals.     If an employer's transmittal of magnetic media wage reports is received by SSA after the filing due date, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for late filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. If reports do not meet SSA processing requirements (unprocessable reports) or are out of balance on critical money amounts, SSA will return them to the employer to correct and resubmit. In addition, beginning with wage reports filed for tax year 1993, if 90 percent or more of an employer's magnetic media wage reports have no social security numbers or incorrect employee names or social security numbers so that SSA is unable to credit their earnings to its records, SSA will not attempt to correct the errors, but will instead return the reports to the employer to correct and resubmit (see also &sect;422.120(b)). An employer must correct and resubmit incorrect and unprocessable magnetic media wage reports to SSA within 45 days from the date of the letter sent with the returned report. Upon request, SSA may grant the employer a 15-day extension of the 45-day period. If an employer does not submit corrected reports to SSA within the 45-day (or, if extended by SSA, 60-day) period, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess a penalty. If an employer timely resubmits the reports as corrected magnetic media reports, but they are unprocessable or out of balance on W&hyph;2 money totals, SSA will return the resubmitted reports for the second and last time for the employer to correct and return to SSA. SSA will enclose with the resubmitted and returned forms a letter informing the employer that he or she must correct and return the reports to SSA within 45 days or be subject to IRS penalties for late filing.    (d)     Paper form reporting requirements.     The format and wage reporting instructions for paper forms are determined jointly by IRS and SSA. Basic instructions on how to complete the forms and file them with SSA are provided in IRS forms materials available to the public. In addition, SSA provides standards for employers (or third parties who file wage reports for them) to follow in producing completed reporting forms from computer software; these standards appear in SSA publication, ``Software Specifications and Edits for Annual Wage Reporting.'' Requests for this publication should be sent to: Social Security Administration, Office of Financial Policy and Operations, Attention: AWR Software Standards Project, P.O. Box 17195, Baltimore, MD 21235.

text: nullnull      (e)     Processing late and incorrect paper form reports    . If SSA receives paper form wage reports after the due date, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for late filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. SSA will ask an employer to provide replacement forms for illegible, incomplete, or clearly erroneous paper reporting forms, or will ask the employer to provide information necessary to process the reports without having to resubmit corrected forms. If an employer fails to provide legible, complete, and correct W&hyph;2 reports within 45 days, SSA may identify the employers to IRS for assessment of employer reporting penalties.    (f)     Reconciliation of wage reporting errors    . After SSA processes wage reports, it matches them with the information provided by employers to the IRS on Forms 941, ``Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return,'' for that tax year. Based upon this match, if the total social security or medicare wages reported to SSA for employees is less than the totals reported to IRS, SSA will write to the employer and request corrected reports or an explanation for the discrepancy. If the total social security or medicare wages reported to SSA for employees is more than the totals reported to IRS, IRS will resolve the difference with the employer. If the employer fails to provide SSA with corrected reports or information that shows the wage reports filed with SSA are correct, SSA will ask IRS to investigate the employer's wage and tax reports to resolve the discrepancy and to assess any appropriate reporting penalties.               &sect;422.115    [Removed]               4. Section 422.115 is removed.    5. Section 422.120 is revised to read as follows:               &sect;422.120    Earnings reported without a social security number or with an incorrect employee name or social security number.               (a)     Correcting an earnings report    . If an employer reports an employee's wages without the employee's social security number or with a different employee name or social security number than shown in SSA's records for him or her, SSA will write to the employee at the address shown on the wage report and request the missing or corrected information. If the wage report does not show the employee's address or shows an incomplete address, SSA will write to the employer and request the missing or corrected employee information. SSA notifies IRS of all wage reports filed without employee social security numbers so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for erroneous filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. If an individual reports self-employment income without a social security number or with a different name or social security number than shown in SSA's records, SSA will write to the individual and request the missing or corrected information. If the employer, employee, or self-employed individual does not provide the missing or corrected report information in response to SSA's request, the wages or self-employment income cannot be identified and credited to the proper individual's earnings records. In such cases, the information is maintained in a ``Suspense File'' of uncredited earnings. Subsequently, if identifying information is provided to SSA for an individual whose report is recorded in the Suspense File, the wages or self-employment income then may be credited to his or her earnings record.    (b)     Returning incorrect reports    . SSA may return to the filer, unprocessed, an employer's annual wage report submittal if 90 percent or more of the wage reports in that submittal are unidentified or incorrectly identified. In such instances, SSA will advise the filer to return corrected wage reports within 45 days to avoid any possible IRS penalty assessment for failing to file correct reports timely with SSA (see also &sect;422.114(c)). Upon request, SSA may grant the employer a 15-day extension of the 45-day period.           5. A new &sect;422.122 is added to read as follows:        &sect;422.122    Information on deferred vested pension benefits.        (a)     Claimants for benefits    . Each month, SSA checks the name and social security number of each new claimant for social security benefits or for hospital insurance coverage to see whether the claimant is listed in SSA's electronic pension benefit record. This record contains information received from IRS on individuals for whom private pension plan administrators have reported to IRS, as required by section 6057 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6057), as possibly having a right to future retirement benefits under the plan. SSA sends a notice to each new claimant for whom it has pension benefit information, as required by section 1131 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&hyph;1). If the claimant filed for the lump-sum death payment on the social security account of a relative, SSA sends the claimant the pension information on the deceased individual. In either case, SSA sends the notice after it has made a decision on the claim for benefits. The notice shows the type, payment frequency, and amount of pension benefit, as well as the name and address of the plan administrator as reported to the IRS. This information can then be used by the claimant to claim any pension benefits still due from the pension plan.

text: nullnull      (b)     Requesting deferred vested pension benefit information from SSA files.     Section 1131 of the Act also requires SSA to provide available pension benefit information on request. SSA will provide this pension benefit information only to the individual who has the pension coverage (or a legal guardian or parent, in the case of a minor, on the individual's behalf). However, if the individual is deceased, the information may be provided to someone who would be eligible for any underpayment of benefits that might be due the individual under &sect;404.503(b) of part 404 of this chapter. All requests for such information must be in writing and should contain the following information: the individual's name, social security number, date of birth, and parent's names; any information the requester may have concerning the name of the pension plan involved and the month and year coverage under the plan ended; the name and address of the person to whom the information is to be sent; and the requester's signature under the following statement: ``I am the individual to whom the information applies (or ``I am related to the individual as his or her     XXX    '').

The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area PM    10     SIP for Libby. In the final rules section of this     Federal Register    , EPA is approving the State's SIP revision, as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.

text:   SUMMARY:     The purpose of this document is to announce the availability of three reports that EPA is considering as it develops the final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (final Guidance) and to request public comment on the possible application of the data set forth in these reports in the final Guidance. The proposed Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (proposed Guidance) was published on April 16, 1993, in the     Federal Register    . Corrections to the proposed preamble and proposed rule text were published in the     Federal Register     on the same date and notices of additional reports and further corrections were published in the     Federal Register     on August 9, 1993 and September 13, 1993.         The three reports being made available for public comment today are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''; ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994.'' EPA wants to ensure that the public has an opportunity to comment on whether: the conversion factors for converting total recoverable metal criteria to dissolved metal criteria should be adopted in the final Guidance methodology for aquatic life; the fish consumption rates used in the development of human health criteria and values should be adjusted based on the results of the 1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study; and the changes in the methodology for deriving Bioaccumulation Factors (BAFs) should be incorporated in the final Guidance.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)) requires EPA to publish and periodically update National ambient water quality criteria. These criteria are to reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic life and recreation. Section 118(c)(2) of the Clean Water Act requires EPA to publish water quality guidance for the Great Lakes System which includes guidance on numerical limits on pollutants in ambient Great Lakes waters to protect human health, aquatic life and wildlife.       The final Guidance will establish minimum water quality standards, antidegradation policies, and implementation procedures for waters within the Great Lakes System in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including waters within the jurisdiction of Indian Tribes within the Great Lakes System.       A. Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests         In the toxicity tests used to develop EPA metals   criteria for aquatic life, some fraction of the metal is dissolved while some fraction is precipitated or bound to particulate matter. It is generally believed that dissolved metals are more available for uptake by aquatic organisms than the bound or precipitated metal fractions and thus more likely to exert a toxic effect. The present National criteria to protect aquatic life were developed using total recoverable metal measurements or measures expected to give equivalent results in toxicity tests, and are expressed as total recoverable. In the past, States and Tribes have independently made the decision to express their metals criteria as either dissolved metal concentrations or total recoverable concentrations when applying the National aquatic life criteria.                 40 CFR Parts 122, 123, 131, and 132                <RINDOCK>RIN 2040&hyph;AC08 </RINDOCK>      Proposed Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of data availability and request for comments.             </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The purpose of this document is to announce the availability of three reports that EPA is considering as it develops the final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (final Guidance) and to request public comment on the possible application of the data set forth in these reports in the final Guidance. The proposed Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (proposed Guidance) was published on April 16, 1993, in the     Federal Register    . Corrections to the proposed preamble and proposed rule text were published in the     Federal Register     on the same date and notices of additional reports and further corrections were published in the     Federal Register     on August 9, 1993 and September 13, 1993.

Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, 60604 (telephone: 312&hyph;353&hyph;2079).            <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)) requires EPA to publish and periodically update National ambient water quality criteria. These criteria are to reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic life and recreation. Section 118(c)(2) of the Clean Water Act requires EPA to publish water quality guidance for the Great Lakes System which includes guidance on numerical limits on pollutants in ambient Great Lakes waters to protect human health, aquatic life and wildlife.       The final Guidance will establish minimum water quality standards, antidegradation policies, and implementation procedures for waters within the Great Lakes System in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including waters within the jurisdiction of Indian Tribes within the Great Lakes System.       A. Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests         In the toxicity tests used to develop EPA metals   criteria for aquatic life, some fraction of the metal is dissolved while some fraction is precipitated or bound to particulate matter. It is generally believed that dissolved metals are more available for uptake by aquatic organisms than the bound or precipitated metal fractions and thus more likely to exert a toxic effect. The present National criteria to protect aquatic life were developed using total recoverable metal measurements or measures expected to give equivalent results in toxicity tests, and are expressed as total recoverable. In the past, States and Tribes have independently made the decision to express their metals criteria as either dissolved metal concentrations or total recoverable concentrations when applying the National aquatic life criteria.     </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      The acute and chronic aquatic life criteria presented in the proposed Guidance were expressed using total recoverable metal measurements, in conformance with the EPA policy at the time. In the preamble to the proposed Guidance, it was noted that a State or Tribe had flexibility when deriving criteria to choose either the total recoverable or dissolved contaminant concentrations. EPA suggested that a site-specific criteria modification procedure known as the water-effects ratio could address concerns about the bioavailability and toxicity of total recoverable or dissolved concentrations. The preamble also indicated that EPA would promulgate total recoverable metals criteria for those States and Tribes who failed to adopt the criteria within the specified time period as written in the proposed Guidance.     The EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) recommended in its December 16, 1992, report, ``Evaluation of the Guidance for the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative,'' that EPA consider both the biologically active form and the total contaminant concentrations of a pollutant when establishing water quality criteria (USEPA, 1992). To further elicit comment on the use of total recoverable vs. dissolved metal concentrations in developing future National aquatic life criteria, EPA held a meeting with invited experts in January 1993 in Annapolis, Maryland. The Agency solicited comments on the recommendations made by the presenters at the meeting in the     Federal Register     on July 9, 1993 (58 FR 32131). Based on the data presented at the conference, and the individual opinions of the majority of assembled scientists, EPA determined that the dissolved metal concentration approximates the bioavailable fraction of waterborne metals for aquatic organisms better than the total recoverable concentration of metals. However, the scientists believed the total recoverable measurements in ambient water also have value, because exceedances of criteria on a total recoverable basis indicate that metal loadings could be a stress to the ecosystem, particularly in locations other than the water column. As a follow-up to the meeting, on October 1, 1993, EPA's Office of Water issued a memorandum to all EPA Regional Water Management Division Directors providing policy and guidance on the interpretation and implementation of aquatic life criteria for the management of metals (USEPA, 1993). The memorandum covered a number of areas including the expression of aquatic life criteria, total maximum daily loads, permits, effluent monitoring, compliance, and ambient monitoring. With regard to expression of aquatic life criteria, the memorandum recommended that State water quality standards be based on dissolved metals because dissolved metal concentrations more closely approximate the bioavailable fraction of metal in the water column than does total recoverable metal concentrations. However, because the present National aquatic life criteria were developed using total recoverable measurements, it is necessary to use a conversion factor to convert the total recoverable metal concentrations to equivalent dissolved metal concentrations. The October 1993 memorandum suggested conversion factors for 10 metals.    Since that time, additional work has been completed to refine these conversion factors. Possible conversion factors for seven of the nine metals included in Tables 1 and 2 of the proposed Guidance for aquatic life are included in Table 1 of this Notice along with a conversion factor for lead. In addition, Table 1 includes preliminary conversion factors for cadmium and mercury(II). The basis for the cadmium and mercury(II) conversion factors can be found in the October 1993 memorandum discussed above. Additional tests for cadmium and mercury(II) are being conducted as described in the report ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''. EPA does not at this time have any reason to believe that the final conversion factors for cadmium and mercury(II) will be different. EPA does not intend to provide additional opportunity to comment on the final conversion factors for cadmium and mercury(II).    The methodology and data used to derive the nine conversion factors can be found in the report ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests,'' which is available in the public docket as described in the addresses section of this notice. To use these factors, a State or Tribe would multiply the criterion for a metal in Table 1 or 2 of the proposed Guidance by the conversion factor in Table 1 of this notice. For example, if the acute water quality criterion for chromium(III) based on total recoverable metal concentration is 15 ug/L and the conversion factor is 0.333, then the equivalent dissolved metal concentration for chromium(III) would be 5.0 ug/L.    If EPA were to publish the final Guidance with metals criteria expressed as dissolved concentrations, States and Tribes would be required to adopt metals criteria consistent with the final Guidance. In that situation, a State or Tribe could adopt criteria expressed as dissolved criteria, or they could choose to adopt the total recoverable criteria without using conversion factors as in the proposed Guidance, since it is a more stringent approach. If a State or Tribe did not adopt metals criteria consistent with the final Guidance, EPA would promulgate dissolved metals criteria for that State or Tribe. This approach is consistent with the recommendations made by the Science Advisory Board and the scientists who attended the January 1993 meeting in Annapolis, Maryland.

The current fish consumption rate used in the derivation of   National ambient water quality criteria is 6.5 grams/day,   which represents a National average consumption value per   person for freshwater and estuarine fish and shellfish.   The proposed Guidance included a fish consumption rate of   15 grams/day, which represents the mean exposure level for   regionally caught fish for the regional sportfishing   population. This estimate was made from a review of   several regional studies in Michigan, Wisconsin and New   York.   A study conducted by West et al., ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan   Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study,'' for the State of   Michigan was submitted during the public comment period for   the proposed Guidance. The study had three main   objectives: (1) to determine fish consumption patterns that   could then be used in setting water quality standards in   Michigan; (2) to determine angler compliance with Michigan   fish consumption advisories and patterns of preparing fish   recommended in fish consumption advisories; and (3) to   determine which sub-populations are at greatest risk so   that educational programs about fish consumption advisories   can be targeted to those populations.   The survey was conducted over one year and included   7000 licensed Michigan anglers who were sampled by mail. A   systematic random sample was drawn such that stratification   by geographic region and license type within each region   was used to ensure that each licensed angler had the same   chance of being selected. By ordering the population by   license type within a region, a proportionate State-wide   distribution of anglers was achieved. Questionnaires were   mailed in two-week cohorts throughout the study period of   January 30, 1991 through January 29, 1992. Surveyed   individuals were asked to report detailed fish consumption   patterns over the preceding 7 days. The survey reported a   response rate of about 47%.   The authors of the report include seven options that   represented their opinions on the possible policy choices   available to the State of Michigan. The seven policy   options include:   Option 1_6.5 grams/day. This represents the average   consumption level for the State of Michigan as a whole (not   just sportanglers).   Option 2_14.5 grams/day. This represents the average   sport fish consumption level by Michigan sport fishermen,   adjusted for non-response bias.   Option 3_24.3 grams/day. This represents the average   total fish consumption level by Michigan sport fishermen,   adjusted for non-response bias.

headline: Social Science Curriculum Development at Selected Central European Universities
text:   SUMMARY:     The Advising, Teaching, and Specialized Programs Division of the Office of Academic Programs of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance award. Public or private non-profit organizations meeting the provisions described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply to cooperate with USIA in the administration of Year One of a three to five-year project to support the development of instruction in the social sciences, especially political science and public policy analysis, at universities in Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The primary departments participating in the project are the Center for Public Affairs Studies at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences, Hungary; the Institute of Sociology at Warsaw University, Poland; and the Department of Political Science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. In addition to supporting the development of programs at these core departments, the project will also enable scholars and students from other institutions in the region to participate in the programs to be based primarily in Warsaw, Budapest, and Cluj-Napoca. The project to be funded in Year One of this program may be implemented over a two-year period and will assist in the development and teaching of up-to-date Western university-level social science curricula.        The rationale for the project is based on the expectation that after the students and faculty involved with this project are equipped to analyze social, political, and public policy issues in an empirically grounded manner, empirical research methods and analytical tools will increasingly inform public debate about these issues, and will encourage cooperation among scholars and public servants.    The USIA solicits detailed proposals from U.S. educational institutions and public and private non-profit organizations to develop and administer a comprehensive range of exchange mechanisms and related activities, including assistance with curriculum and materials development and acquisition, and to identify and cooperate with appropriate U.S. departments and scholars in support of the project. The award to cooperate with the USIA on Year One of the project will be renewable for up to two additional fiscal years that may comprise up to four additional program years upon successful completion of Year One activity. Applicants should propose detailed, creative programs for all three countries for Year One of the project and should outline a strategy for the on-going assessment of Year One programs to determine program effectiveness and to facilitate the definition of programs for two additional fiscal years. The cooperation with USIA will include regular consultation with USIA and USIS field posts with regard to program implementation, direction, and assessment. Proposals should demonstrate both an understanding of the issues confronting central European universities and expertise in the teaching and practice of the social sciences in U.S. higher education, including graduate education.

text: null  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion, geographic location, socioeconomic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle. Academic programs under the authority of the Bureau must maintain their scholarly integrity.      Overview      The goal of the project is to assist the Center for Public Affairs Studies at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences, the Institute of Sociology at Warsaw University, the Department of Political Science at Babes-Bolyai University, and social science departments at other universities in the region to develop up-to-date curricula, revise existing curricula, establish new courses, and develop and utilize new teaching methodologies and materials in local languages. In addition to a common emphasis on public policy analysis, the program at Warsaw University will also include empirically based approaches to the study of industrial relations, while at Babes-Bolyai University the program will also include the study of comparative politics and other aspects of political science.  The curricular development at all three departments will emphasize empirical methods and will enable faculty and students to gain experience with the tools for analyzing social, political, and public policy issues empirically. At the conclusion of the project, the faculty at participating departments should be capable of teaching the newly introduced or revised courses with appropriate teaching materials and should be able to participate more fully in international scholarly dialogue in their respective disciplines. Students graduating from the participating departments should be prepared to assume responsibilities in public service, education, and the private sector with the expertise required to plan and evaluate programs responsibly.      Participants      The project is designed for the following participants: faculty and students associated with the departments identified for primary support; faculty and students from other institutions in the region; and postdoctoral specialists from the U.S. who are qualified to train the central European faculty and students (applicant organizations do not need to obtain letters of commitment from the primary foreign institutions, which have indicated their interest and commitment directly to USIA). The primary departments are:  (a) Budapest University of Economics, Center for Public Affairs Studies, to assist in developing the Center's program for students specializing in empirically based public policy analysis;  (b) Warsaw University, Institute of Sociology, to develop programs of instruction in empirically based approaches to industrial relations and public policy analysis;  (c) Babes-Bolyai University, Faculty of History and Philosophy, to develop a department of political science emphasizing empirical methods, public policy analysis, and comparative politics.  (d) In addition, funds are available to enable the participation of faculty and students from other institutions in Poland, Hungary, and Romania in programs offered in cooperation with the three core universities.      Logistics      The recipient organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include providing international and domestic travel arrangements for all participants, making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing participants, preparing any necessary support material, and working with the foreign participating universities, U.S. host institutions and individual grantees to achieve maximum program effectiveness.      Visa/Insurance/Tax Requirements      U.S. lecturers and consultants participating in the project must be U.S. citizens. Programs must comply with   J&hyph;1 visa regulations. Please refer to program specific guidelines in Application Package for further details. Administration of the program must be in compliance with reporting and withholding regulations for federal, state, and local taxes as applicable. Recipient organizations should demonstrate tax regulation adherence in the proposal narrative and budget.      Program Description      Exchange and non-exchange activities should complement and reinforce one another within and among the primary supported departments and at other institutions in Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The ability to coordinate and evaluate exchange mechanisms and other activities to support the goal of faculty and curriculum development in the primary departments and at other institutions will be critical to the success of the project.         <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion, geographic location, socioeconomic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle. Academic programs under the authority of the Bureau must maintain their scholarly integrity.      Overview      The goal of the project is to assist the Center for Public Affairs Studies at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences, the Institute of Sociology at Warsaw University, the Department of Political Science at Babes-Bolyai University, and social science departments at other universities in the region to develop up-to-date curricula, revise existing curricula, establish new courses, and develop and utilize new teaching methodologies and materials in local languages. In addition to a common emphasis on public policy analysis, the program at Warsaw University will also include empirically based approaches to the study of industrial relations, while at Babes-Bolyai University the program will also include the study of comparative politics and other aspects of political science.  The curricular development at all three departments will emphasize empirical methods and will enable faculty and students to gain experience with the tools for analyzing social, political, and public policy issues empirically. At the conclusion of the project, the faculty at participating departments should be capable of teaching the newly introduced or revised courses with appropriate teaching materials and should be able to participate more fully in international scholarly dialogue in their respective disciplines. Students graduating from the participating departments should be prepared to assume responsibilities in public service, education, and the private sector with the expertise required to plan and evaluate programs responsibly.      Participants      The project is designed for the following participants: faculty and students associated with the departments identified for primary support; faculty and students from other institutions in the region; and postdoctoral specialists from the U.S. who are qualified to train the central European faculty and students (applicant organizations do not need to obtain letters of commitment from the primary foreign institutions, which have indicated their interest and commitment directly to USIA). The primary departments are:  (a) Budapest University of Economics, Center for Public Affairs Studies, to assist in developing the Center's program for students specializing in empirically based public policy analysis;  (b) Warsaw University, Institute of Sociology, to develop programs of instruction in empirically based approaches to industrial relations and public policy analysis;  (c) Babes-Bolyai University, Faculty of History and Philosophy, to develop a department of political science emphasizing empirical methods, public policy analysis, and comparative politics.  (d) In addition, funds are available to enable the participation of faculty and students from other institutions in Poland, Hungary, and Romania in programs offered in cooperation with the three core universities.      Logistics      The recipient organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include providing international and domestic travel arrangements for all participants, making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing participants, preparing any necessary support material, and working with the foreign participating universities, U.S. host institutions and individual grantees to achieve maximum program effectiveness.      Visa/Insurance/Tax Requirements      U.S. lecturers and consultants participating in the project must be U.S. citizens. Programs must comply with   J&hyph;1 visa regulations. Please refer to program specific guidelines in Application Package for further details. Administration of the program must be in compliance with reporting and withholding regulations for federal, state, and local taxes as applicable. Recipient organizations should demonstrate tax regulation adherence in the proposal narrative and budget.      Program Description      Exchange and non-exchange activities should complement and reinforce one another within and among the primary supported departments and at other institutions in Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The ability to coordinate and evaluate exchange mechanisms and other activities to support the goal of faculty and curriculum development in the primary departments and at other institutions will be critical to the success of the project.    </SUPPLEM>

Barry Corporation,   (Footwear and Thermal Comfort Products),   Goldsboro, NC        An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones   Board (the Board) by the Triangle J Council of Governments, grantee of FTZ 93, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the distribution facilities of R.G. Barry Corporation, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on November 16, 1994.     R.G. Barry is a manufacturer and distributor of comfort footwear (household slippers) and thermal comfort products (heat seats, scarves, back warmers, hand warmers, pocket warmers, ear muffs and bread warmers) with total sales of over $100 million (1993) and worldwide employment of 3,685 persons. The company has U.S. plants in San Angelo, Texas, Goldsboro, North Carolina, and Laredo, Texas, with operational headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. An application is pending with the FTZ Board for subzone status for warehouse/distribution activities at Barry's San Angelo plant (FTZ Docket 34&hyph;94, 59 FR 56459, 11/14/94).       R.G. Barry's Goldsboro, North Carolina plant is located at 2201 South John Street (172,020 sq. ft. on 35 acres), some 45 miles southeast of Raleigh. The facility (65 employees) is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of R.G. Barry's footwear and comfort products. The products are generally made of domestic materials (polyester and other man-made fibers), which are cut at Barry plants in the U.S. and sent to company plants abroad to be sewn. The finished products are then shipped to Barry's U.S. distribution centers. While currently over five percent of the finished products are reexported, the company plans to increase export activity to 14 percent.     Zone procedures would exempt R.G. Barry from Customs duty payments on the foreign value involved in products that are reexported. On its domestic sales, the company would be able to defer Customs duties on the value added abroad. The application indicates that zone savings would help improve the international competitiveness of the company's domestic operations.     In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.     Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is January 30, 1995. Rebuttal comments in response to material   submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to February 13, 1995).     A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations:         U.S. Commerce District Office,   400 W.

On   October 7, 1994, IPSCO timely withdrew its request for an   administrative review of the above referenced order. Because   there were no other requests for review of this company from any   other interested party, the Department is now terminating this   review with respect to IPSCO, Inc.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On August 30, 1994, the Department received a request from IPSCO, Inc. to conduct an administrative review of the   antidumping duty order pursuant to &sect;353.22(a)(2) of the   Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.33(a)(2)).       On September 8, 1994, the Department published in the       Federal Register     a Notice of Initiation for this review (59 FR   46391). On October 7, 1994, IPSCO, Inc. withdrew its request for   administrative review. This withdrawal was made within the time   limits established in &sect;353.22(a)(5) of the Department's   regulations. No other interested party has requested an   administrative review of IPSCO's entries in this proceeding.   In accordance with &sect;353.22(a)(5) of the Department's   regulations, the Department has determined to terminate this   administrative review for IPSCO, Inc.   Absent a review, we shall instruct the Customs Service to   liquidate IPSCO's entries.

Scope of Order       The products covered by this order are certain paper clips, wholly of wire of base metal, whether or not galvanized, whether or not plated with nickel or other base metal (    e.g.    , copper), with a wire diameter between 0.025 inches and 0.075 inches (0.64 to 1.91 millimeters), regardless of physical configuration, except as specifically excluded. The products subject to this order may have a rectangular or ring-like shape and include, but are not limited to, clips commercially referred to as ``No. 1 clips'', ``No. 3 clips'', ``Jumbo'' or ``Giant'' clips, ``Gem clips'', ``Frictioned clips'', ``Perfect Gems'', ``Marcel Gems'', ``Universal clips'', ``Nifty clips'', ``Peerless clips'', ``Ring clips'', and ``Glide-On clips''.   Specifically excluded from the scope of this order are plastic and vinyl covered paper clips, butterfly clips, binder clips, or other paper fasteners that are not made wholly of wire of base metal and are covered under a separate subheading of the     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States     (HTSUS).   The products subject to this order are currently classifiable under subheading 8305.90.3010 of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this order is dispositive.       Antidumping Duty Order       In accordance with section 735(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), on September 30, 1994, the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') made its final determination that certain paper clips from the People's Republic of China (``PRC'') were being sold at less than fair value (59 FR 51168, October 7, 1994). On November 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission notified the Department of its final determination, pursuant to section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports of the subject merchandise.   Therefore, all unliquidated entries of certain paper clips from the PRC entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 18, 1994, which is the date on which the Department published its notice of preliminary determination in the     Federal Register    , are liable for the assessment of antidumping duties.   In accordance with section 736(a)(1) of the Act, the Department will direct Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all relevant entries of certain paper clips from the PRC. Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties on this merchandise, a cash deposit equal to the estimated weighted-average antidumping duty margins as noted below. The ``All Others'' rate applies to all exporters of PRC paper clips not specifically listed below.   The     ad valorem     weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:      <TABLE>       &blank;    1Manufacturer/producer/exporter     1Margin percentage           Shanghai Lansheng Corporation   57.64   Zhejiang Light Industrial Products   Import and Export Corporation   46.01   Zhejiang Machinery and Equipment   Import and Export Corporation   60.70   All Others (including Abel Industries)   126.94    </TABLE>     This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to certain paper clips from the PRC, pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act.

headline: Fishnetting of Man-Made Fiber From Japan; Amended Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review
text:   SUMMARY:     On May 26, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) submitted to the Court of International Trade (CIT) the final results of redetermination pursuant to a remand in     Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States     (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522, February 28, 1994). On September 8, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 94&hyph;140). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, period with respect to Momoi Fishing Net Manufacturing Co. (Momoi). Momoi's rate is zero percent for the 1990&hyph;1991 period.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    Background          On February 28, 1994, the CIT, in     Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States     (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522, February 28, 1994), remanded to the Department for redetermination the final results of the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, administrative review of the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan (37 FR 11560, June 9, 1972).    In the Department's final results of administrative review, the dumping margin for Momoi's fishnetting sold or imported into the United States for the period June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, was 2.67 percent. Momoi's dumping margin for those final results was calculated based on the price to Momoi's U.S. importers (    see Fishnetting of Man-Made Fiber from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review,     58 FR 42291 (August 9, 1993)). Based on the information on the record, the Department concluded that the price to Momoi's U.S. importers included U.S. Customs duties and brokerage expenses.    On February 28, 1994, the CIT remanded this case to the Department to reconsider whether Momoi's C.I.F. sales excluded any charges for U.S. Customs duties and U.S. brokerage charges in the calculation of United States price (USP) for Momoi (    see Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States     (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522)).        Final Remand Results        In accordance with the CIT's order, the Department revised its final results with respect to Momoi for the 1990&hyph;1991 administrative review of fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. Based on additional documents provided by Momoi in response to a supplemental questionnaire issued by the Department, we determined that Momoi's C.I.F. sales prices excluded U.S. Customs duties and U.S. brokerage charges. We determined that the revised weighted-average margin based on this information for the period June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, is zero percent.        Final Results of Redetermination        On September 8, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 94&hyph;140). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991 period with respect to Momoi. Momoi's rate for the 1990&hyph;1991 period is zero percent.    Since we have not conducted an administrative review of Momoi for a later period, we will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to apply these amended results as a cash deposit for entries of merchandise produced by Momoi. This deposit requirement, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.    The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.    This amendment to final results of antidumping duty administrative review notice is in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.

Co. v. United States     (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522, February 28, 1994). On September 8, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 94&hyph;140). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, period with respect to Momoi Fishing Net Manufacturing Co. (Momoi). Momoi's rate is zero percent for the 1990&hyph;1991 period.           </SUMMARY> <DATE>  EFFECTIVE DATE:     November 25, 1994.         </DATE>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:        Kimberly Moore or Tom Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0090.          <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    Background          On February 28, 1994, the CIT, in     Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States     (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522, February 28, 1994), remanded to the Department for redetermination the final results of the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, administrative review of the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan (37 FR 11560, June 9, 1972).    In the Department's final results of administrative review, the dumping margin for Momoi's fishnetting sold or imported into the United States for the period June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, was 2.67 percent. Momoi's dumping margin for those final results was calculated based on the price to Momoi's U.S. importers (    see Fishnetting of Man-Made Fiber from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review,     58 FR 42291 (August 9, 1993)). Based on the information on the record, the Department concluded that the price to Momoi's U.S. importers included U.S. Customs duties and brokerage expenses.    On February 28, 1994, the CIT remanded this case to the Department to reconsider whether Momoi's C.I.F. sales excluded any charges for U.S. Customs duties and U.S. brokerage charges in the calculation of United States price (USP) for Momoi (    see Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States     (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522)).        Final Remand Results        In accordance with the CIT's order, the Department revised its final results with respect to Momoi for the 1990&hyph;1991 administrative review of fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. Based on additional documents provided by Momoi in response to a supplemental questionnaire issued by the Department, we determined that Momoi's C.I.F. sales prices excluded U.S. Customs duties and U.S. brokerage charges. We determined that the revised weighted-average margin based on this information for the period June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, is zero percent.        Final Results of Redetermination        On September 8, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 94&hyph;140). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991 period with respect to Momoi.

In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to establish sublimits for Categories 611, 619, 620 in the Fabric Group for the 1994 agreement period and increase the current limits for the Fabric Group and Categories 338/339 and 347/348. The limits for Categories 647/648 and 645/646 are being reduced to account for additional flexibility which was applied as a result of the increases. In addition, the sublimits for Categories 334, 335 and 635 are being eliminated.    A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see     Federal Register     notice 58 FR 62645, published on November 29, 1993). Also see 58 FR 65580, published on December 15, 1993.    The letter to the Commissioner of Customs and the actions taken pursuant to it are not designed to implement all of the provisions of the MOU, but are designed to assist only in the implementation of certain of its provisions.

headline: Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement 
text:   SUMMARY:     The Department of Energy (Department) announces the availability of the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Project's Draft Statement (EIS&hyph;0221) prepared to assess the environmental and human health effects of the design, construction, and operation of a proposed 250 (gross) megawatt electric (MWe) atmospheric circulating fluidized bed cogeneration facility, to be located in North Codorus Township, York County, Pennsylvania. As one of the proposals selected under Round I of the Clean Coal Technology Program, the Cogeneration Project would demonstrate the applicability of atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion and cogeneration technology at a utility scale. This technology, when compared to conventional coal burning technologies, would result in a cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen, and particles from a nominal 250&hyph;MWe (227 MWe net) coal-fired power plant. The proposed action is the cost-shared Federal funding of the project by the Department of approximately $75 million (about 20 percent of the total cost of approximately $350 million). The industrial partner for this proposed project is York County Energy Partners, L.P., a project company of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. The proposed project would be a cogeneration facility, supplying steam to be purchased by   P.H. Glatfelter Company, and electricity that would be purchased by Metropolitan Edison Company. As a result of the purchase of steam, P.H. Glatfelter Company's No. 4 power boiler would be placed on hot-standby status and operated up to 720 hours per year in parallel with the proposed project. This would result in a net reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide and particles within York County, Pennsylvania. In addition, emission reduction credits for oxides of nitrogen emissions would be transferred, in part, from the No. 4 power boiler to the proposed project in order to generate the 1.15 to 1 offsets required by law.         The Draft Statement assesses the environmental impacts of the atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion and cogeneration technology at a large utility scale and setting. The technologies to be demonstrated include a Foster Wheeler 2,500 MMBtu/hr single-train atmospheric circulating fluidized bed boiler, incorporating selective non-catalytic reduction for reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen, limestone injection for reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide, and fine particle filters for reducing particulate emissions.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background and Need for the Proposed Action         The Department proposes to provide cost-shared funding support for the design, construction, and operation of a 250&hyph;MWe (gross) coal-fired atmospheric circulating fluidized bed cogeneration power plant at North Codorus Township, Pennsylvania, to demonstrate the cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter. The proposed project was selected by the Department for negotiation of a Cooperative Agreement for Federal assistance under the Clean Coal Technology Program. Following a 24-month demonstration period anticipated to conclude in December, 1999, the facility would enter into commercial operation for a period of approximately 23 years. The proposed project would be located in North Codorus Township in York County, Pennsylvania, approximately 6 miles southwest of York, Pennsylvania. The proposed project would be built on property currently owned by P.H. Glatfelter Company, which would purchase approximately 400,000 lbs/hr of steam for industrial use from the proposed cogeneration project.     In December 1985, Congress allocated funds to the Department for conducting the first round of the cost-shared Clean Coal Technology Program. On   February 17, 1986, the Department issued a Program Opportunity Notice soliciting proposals to conduct cost-shared projects to demonstrate innovative, energy efficient, economically competitive coal-based technologies that had potential for commercialization in the 1990s. In response to the solicitation, 51 proposals were received. From these proposals, nine projects were selected by the Department in July of 1986 for negotiation, and a list of alternate candidates was established in the event that one or more of the initial nine projects did not proceed. In June of 1989, the Arvah B. Hopkins Circulating Fluidized Bed Repowering Project, proposed by the City of Tallahassee, Florida, was selected from the alternate list. As originally envisioned, this project would have repowered one of the City of Tallahassee's municipally-owned natural gas boilers with atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion technology.                    <DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement </DOCTITLE>  and Public Hearings for the Proposed York County Energy Partners   Cogeneration Project at North Codorus Township, PA        <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Department of Energy.          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft Statement), Notice of Public Hearings on the Draft Statement, and Floodplains/Wetlands Notification.           </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The Department of Energy (Department) announces the availability of the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Project's Draft Statement (EIS&hyph;0221) prepared to assess the environmental and human health effects of the design, construction, and operation of a proposed 250 (gross) megawatt electric (MWe) atmospheric circulating fluidized bed cogeneration facility, to be located in North Codorus Township, York County, Pennsylvania.

Telephone: (202) 586&hyph;4600 or (800) 472&hyph;2756.        <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background and Need for the Proposed Action         The Department proposes to provide cost-shared funding support for the design, construction, and operation of a 250&hyph;MWe (gross) coal-fired atmospheric circulating fluidized bed cogeneration power plant at North Codorus Township, Pennsylvania, to demonstrate the cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter. The proposed project was selected by the Department for negotiation of a Cooperative Agreement for Federal assistance under the Clean Coal Technology Program. Following a 24-month demonstration period anticipated to conclude in December, 1999, the facility would enter into commercial operation for a period of approximately 23 years. The proposed project would be located in North Codorus Township in York County, Pennsylvania, approximately 6 miles southwest of York, Pennsylvania. The proposed project would be built on property currently owned by P.H. Glatfelter Company, which would purchase approximately 400,000 lbs/hr of steam for industrial use from the proposed cogeneration project.     In December 1985, Congress allocated funds to the Department for conducting the first round of the cost-shared Clean Coal Technology Program. On   February 17, 1986, the Department issued a Program Opportunity Notice soliciting proposals to conduct cost-shared projects to demonstrate innovative, energy efficient, economically competitive coal-based technologies that had potential for commercialization in the 1990s. In response to the solicitation, 51 proposals were received. From these proposals, nine projects were selected by the Department in July of 1986 for negotiation, and a list of alternate candidates was established in the event that one or more of the initial nine projects did not proceed. In June of 1989, the Arvah B. Hopkins Circulating Fluidized Bed Repowering Project, proposed by the City of Tallahassee, Florida, was selected from the alternate list. As originally envisioned, this project would have repowered one of the City of Tallahassee's municipally-owned natural gas boilers with atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion technology.         </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      In early September 1991, the City of Tallahassee indicated that it no longer wished to proceed with the proposed project. The City indicated its willingness to cooperate with the effort to relocate the project, and other potential hosts for the project were then considered. Subsequently, the Department agreed to reassign the project to York County Energy Partners, a subsidiary of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., of Allentown, Pennsylvania. The new sponsors proposed to relocate the project from Tallahassee, Florida, to an industrial site adjacent to the J.E. Baker Company quarry and brick manufacturing operations in West Manchester Township, York County, Pennsylvania, and to operate the project as a cogeneration facility. Steam produced by the project would have been purchased by the J.E. Baker Company and electricity would have been purchased by Metropolitan Edison Company. All other major aspects of the project would have remained essentially unchanged from the original project.     During the summer of 1992, York County Energy Partners sought opportunities for air emissions reductions from existing companies in the vicinity of the proposed project as a means of acquiring air emissions offsets. Discussions with P.H. Glatfelter Company indicated that the desired level of air emissions reductions could be achieved by relocating the project to P.H. Glatfelter Company's paper mill facility in North Codorus Township, if the proposed York County Energy Partners project could provide sufficient steam to largely displace an existing    P.H. Glatfelter Company coal-fired boiler. Additionally, it was determined that the co-location of the proposed cogeneration project with P.H. Glatfelter Company's paper mill facility would enable York County Energy Partners to treat and recycle wastewater from the mill for use as cooling water at the proposed cogeneration facility, thereby greatly reducing the amount of fresh water used. Accordingly, on February 1, 1993, York County Energy Partners and P.H. Glatfelter Company issued a joint statement that they were evaluating the feasibility of relocating the proposed York County Energy Partners project to the North Codorus Township site. The Department was requested to consider York County Energy Partners' proposed site change. The Department issued its approval of the proposed site change in a memorandum dated June 23, 1993.         Environmental Impact Statement Preparation         The Draft Statement has been prepared in accordance with Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, as implemented in regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) and by the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021). In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Department determined that providing cost-shared funding for the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Project constitutes a major Federal action that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Department has prepared a Draft Statement to assess the potential impacts of both the proposed action, and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, on the human and natural environment.     A Notice of Intent (Notice) to prepare an environmental impact statement and hold public scoping meetings was published in the     Federal Register     on July 29, 1993 (58 FR 40631). The Notice invited oral and written comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of the environmental impact statement, including environmental issues and alternatives, and invited public participation in the National Environmental Policy Act process. Scoping meetings were held on August 19, 1993 and October 5, 1993 in North Codorus Township and York, Pennsylvania, respectively. Overall, the Department received 614 comments. As a result of the scoping process, the Department developed an Environmental Impact Statement Implementation Plan to define the scope and to provide further guidance for preparing the environmental impact statement.     The Draft Statement provides an analysis of information prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed construction and operation of the York County Energy Partners Project at the proposed site. This Draft Statement also considers the proposed action, an alternate site, and the no-action alternative, which includes a scenario that reasonably could be expected to result as a consequence of the no-action alternative. Impacts to human health, atmospheric resources, surface water, groundwater, socioeconomic resources (including environmental justice), noise, and traffic from construction and operation of the proposed York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Project have been analyzed. Impacts to biological resources, biodiversity, floodplains, and wetlands are also considered.         Floodplains/Wetlands Notification         Pursuant to Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) and the Department's Procedures for Compliance with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR 1022), notification is provided that portions of electric connections and pipeline corridors proposed as components of the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Project would be constructed and operated in the 100-year floodplain (as depicted on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood Insurance Rate Map; Panel Number 422223 0005, 0010 and Panel Number 422227 0005, 0010). In addition, portions of ladder tracks and a rail spur associated with the proposed project would also be located within the 100-year floodplain. A total of approximately 1.1 acres would be expected to be utilized for placement of these ancillary facilities within the 100-year floodplain.     Small areas of the Codorus Creek's 100-year floodplain would be unavoidably impacted by development to connect the proposed project with utility (electric) substation facilities. Approximately 14 to 22 power line utility poles (required to provide a connection between the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Facility and Metropolitan-Edison's existing Bair Substation) would be located within the 100-year floodplain of Codorus Creek. This electric interconnect would intersect the floodplain on property controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and property owned by P.H. Glatfelter Company. It is estimated that 4&hyph;8 utility poles would be located on land belonging to P.H. Glatfelter Company, and 10&hyph;14 utility poles would be located on land controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. Placement of these utility poles would impact approximately 0.013 acres of the 100-year floodplain. Construction and operation of these electrical connections (and their rights-of way) would be conducted in accord with relevant regulatory requirements and in consultation with appropriate regulatory agencies.

text: nullnull      Short segments of the proposed facility's steam supply pipeline to P.H. Glatfelter Company and condensate return pipeline would also be located within an identified 100-year floodplain, affecting approximately 0.3 acres. A small area (approximately 0.8 acres) of the Codorus Creek 100-year floodplain would be impacted by ladder tracks and rail spur that would require an expansion of the existing YorkRail right-of-way on P.H. Glatfelter Company property. The rail structures would be similar to, and closely parallel, the existing YorkRail Main line at the same elevation.     Impacts during construction would include equipment and vehicle access, earth disturbance, sedimentation, erosion from exposed soils, damaged vegetation, and placement and compaction of fill to support new rail lines. In addition, the steam and condensate return pipelines to P.H. Glatfelter Company would require permanent pipe supports to be placed within the floodplain. During operation, there would be some periodic minor disturbance due to personnel and equipment entry for inspection and maintenance of the new ladder tracks, rail spur, and above-ground steam and condensate return pipelines to P.H. Glatfelter Company.     The potential impacts and mitigation measures associated with the above proposed activities within identified floodplains are discussed in Section 4 of the Draft Statement and constitutes the floodplains assessment in accordance with 10 CFR Part 1022.     Comments regarding the effects of the proposed action on floodplains may be submitted to the Department in accordance with the procedures described below.     In accordance with Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, and the Department's Procedures for Compliance with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR Part 1022), wetlands protection has also been considered in the Department's Draft Statement. Above- and below-ground pipeline connections between the proposed new facility and existing facilities would require construction affecting approximately 0.5 acres of wetlands. These wetlands would be temporarily disturbed as a result of construction and excavation activities associated with pipeline installation.     Four identified wetlands, along with Codorus Creek, would be potentially affected by the proposed project and utility corridors. A fringe wetland bordering Mill Pond and Kessler Pond would be unavoidably affected by placement of permanent pipe support foundations for a pipe rack supporting the steam and condensate return pipelines to the P.H. Glatfelter Company facility. This wetland impact is unavoidable due to the proposed facility being sited on the opposite side of Codurus Creek from the P.H. Glatfelter Company facility. Three other wetlands would be traversed by supply and return pipelines for the proposed project cooling tower. A total of approximately 0.20 acre of these three wetlands would be impacted for excavation and underground placement of cooling tower supply and return pipelines from the proposed facility to P.H. Glatfelter Company facilities.     During construction of the pipeline interconnect, vegetation would be selectively removed using manual labor whenever possible in order to minimize potential impacts associated with mechanical clearing techniques. York County Energy Partners would obtain regulatory approval prior to construction or disturbance of wetlands. Potential impacts during construction and operation, such as erosion and sedimentation, would be controlled with appropriate mitigation measures (such as silt fencing during construction).     It should be noted, however, that construction of the proposed electrical interconnect corridor, the proposed rail spur, and ladder track associated with this proposed project would not result in incursion into wetland areas.     Potential environmental impacts to wetlands are discussed more fully in Chapter 4 of the Draft Statement and constitutes the wetlands assessment in accordance with 10 CFR Part 1022. Comments regarding the effects of the proposed action on wetland areas may be submitted to the Department in accordance with the procedures described below.         Comment Procedures         Availability of Draft Statement         Copies of the Draft Statement are being distributed to organizations, environmental groups, and individuals known to be interested in or affected by the proposed project. Additional copies of the document or appendices to the main document may be obtained by contacting the Department as provided in the section of this notice entitled     ADDRESSES    .

Take notice that on November 15, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing a petition for clarification or a temporary waiver of Section 23.2 (Credit Mechanism for Interruptible Transportation Revenues) of the General Terms and Conditions (Section 23.2) of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1.    Southern states that waiver would allow Southern to defer making the revenue credits required by this section of its tariff until such time as the fixed cost allocation to the interruptible transportation (IT) rate is established with finality. In view of the Commission's order dated March 16, 1994, in Southern's Docket Nos. RP92&hyph;10&hyph;006,     et al.      1   which requires that any change in the IT level of throughout made in the upcoming hearing in Southern Docket No. RP93&hyph;15&hyph;000 be applied retroactively, Southern states that it would be premature to make revenue credits at this time.            1      66 FERC &para;61,302.          Southern states submits that such a clarification or waiver of Section 23.2 is warranted because the amount of fixed costs allocated to IT service are now subject to revision retroactively and thus the appropriate credits cannot be accurately calculated at this time. Given this uncertainty, Southern states that the Commission should waive compliance with this provision of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff until such time as the necessary components for calculating such credits are final and ascertainable.    Southern states that a copy of the filing is being served on all of Southern's customers.    Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's regulations.

text:   SUMMARY:     We are amending the Federal Seed Act regulations to remove the origin staining requirements for seed of alfalfa and red clover grown in Mexico and imported into the United States. The removal of the requirements is necessary to make the regulations conform to the amendment of the Federal Seed Act by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The effect of this action is to relieve a restriction on importation of alfalfa and red clover seed from Mexico.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Background       We are amending the Federal Seed Act Regulations in 7 CFR part 201 (referred to below as the regulations) by removing the requirement that 10   percent of each container of alfalfa or red clover grown in Mexico be stained red.   On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective January 1, 1994. To implement this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The statutory amendments included in the Act become effective coincident with NAFTA.     The amendment in this final rule is mandated by section 361(a) of the Act, which amended section 302(e)(1) of the Federal Seed Act (7 U.S.C. 1582(e)(1)) by providing that the provisions requiring certain seeds to be stained red shall not apply to alfalfa or red clover seed originating in Mexico. (See Pub. L. 103&hyph;182).   This final rule is being taken to conform the regulations with the amendments to the Act, by amending &sect;201.104 of the regulations to remove the origin staining requirements for seed of alfalfa and red clover grown in Mexico and imported into the United States.       Emergency Action         The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has   determined that good cause exists to publish this final rule without prior   notice and opportunity for public comment.     Certain regulatory actions must be taken as a result of the statutory amendments discussed in the ``    Background    ,'' and must become effective with NAFTA to avoid inconsistency between the regulations and their statutory authority. Removal of the origin staining requirement for alfalfa and red clover seed imported from Mexico is one of the regulatory changes that must become effective at the same time as NAFTA and the Act to avoid this conflict.     This action relieves a restriction on the importation of alfalfa and red clover seed from Mexico. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this final   rule are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest, and   since this regulatory change is mandated by Congress, there is good cause   under 5 U.S.C. 553 for making this final rule effective as of January 1, 1994.         Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act         This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.     The Act, as amended, removes the requirement that alfalfa and red clover seed that is imported from Mexico be stained red. This final rule conforms the regulations to the Act. We have no record of any alfalfa or red clover having been imported from Mexico in the past 5 years, and we anticipate no importations in the foreseeable future.     Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant   Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a   significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.      Executive Order 12278      This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice   Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations   that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and   (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit   in court challenging this rule.       Paperwork Reduction Act      This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements   under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501     et seq    .).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background         The regulations in 7 CFR part 322 (referred to below as the regulations)   govern the importation into the United States of honeybees and honeybee semen.   These regulations were established pursuant to the Honeybee Act (7 U.S.C. 281   et seq.) The Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the   &sect;United States of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees. In addition,   the Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the United States   of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.     Section 322.1 of the regulations contains a footnote that includes the   criteria set forth in the Honeybee Act for determining which countries may be   listed in the regulations as countries from which honeybees or honeybee semen   may be imported into the United States. In this rule, we are amending that   footnote to reflect amendments to the Honeybee Act made by section 361(d)(2)   of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.     On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free   Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective January 1, 1994. To implement   this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement   Implementation Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The statutory amendments   included in the Act become effective coincident with NAFTA.     Section 361(d)(2) of the Act amended subsections (a) and (b) of the   Honeybee Act by providing the following: (1) That honeybees may be imported   from Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms as the Secretary of Agriculture   determines appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada   or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely to remain,   free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or   subspecies of honeybees; and (2) that honeybee semen may be imported from   Canada or Mexico, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the region   of Canada or Mexico from which the imports originate is, and is likely to   remain, free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. (See Pub. L.   103&hyph;182; 107 Stat. 2057).   This rule is being published to conform a footnote in the regulations with   the Act, as amended.

In addition,   the Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the United States   of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.     Section 322.1 of the regulations contains a footnote that includes the   criteria set forth in the Honeybee Act for determining which countries may be   listed in the regulations as countries from which honeybees or honeybee semen   may be imported into the United States. In this rule, we are amending that   footnote to reflect amendments to the Honeybee Act made by section 361(d)(2)   of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.     On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free   Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective January 1, 1994. To implement   this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement   Implementation Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The statutory amendments   included in the Act become effective coincident with NAFTA.     Section 361(d)(2) of the Act amended subsections (a) and (b) of the   Honeybee Act by providing the following: (1) That honeybees may be imported   from Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms as the Secretary of Agriculture   determines appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada   or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely to remain,   free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or   subspecies of honeybees; and (2) that honeybee semen may be imported from   Canada or Mexico, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the region   of Canada or Mexico from which the imports originate is, and is likely to   remain, free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. (See Pub. L.   103&hyph;182; 107 Stat. 2057).   This rule is being published to conform a footnote in the regulations with   the Act, as amended.       Emergency Action     </SUPPLEM>

text: nullnull      The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that good cause exists to publish this final rule without prior notice and opportunity for public comment.   Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this final rule are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest, and since this regulatory change is mandated by Congress, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 for making this final rule effective as of January 1, 1994.       Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act       This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.   This rule amends a footnote in the regulations that quotes the Act, in order to conform the footnote to the Act, as amended by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.  The amendments to the regulations will have no practical impact on importations of honeybees and honeybee semen from Canada or Mexico since it merely quotes the Act. Furthermore, such importations are already allowed from any part of Canada. Currently, the only regular movement of honeybees from Canada to the United States is a relatively insignificant movement from the Maritime Provinces of Canada to northern New England. We anticipate that the amendments will have little practical impact with regard to importations from Mexico. Sufficient numbers of honeybees are already available in the United States to make it unnecessary to import honeybees or honeybee semen from Mexico.  Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.       Executive Order 12778       This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.       Paperwork Reduction Act       This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501     et seq.    ).       List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 322      Bees, Honey, Imports, Quarantine, Transportation.         Accordingly 7 CFR part 322 is amended as follows:      PART 322_HONEYBEES AND HONEYBEE SEMEN      1. The authority citation for part 322 is revised to read as follows:             Authority:     7 U.S.C. 281; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c).               2.

In this regard, 7 U.S.C. provides in relevant part, that:        (a) In order to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees, and the introduction of genetically undesirable germ plasm of honeybees, the importation into the United States of all honeybees is prohibited, except that honeybees may be imported into the United States_  (1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes;  (2) From countries determined by the Secretary of Agriculture_  (A) To be free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees; and  (B) To have in operation precautions adequate to prevent the importation of honeybees from other countries where harmful diseases or parasites, or undesirable species or subspecies, of honeybees exist; or  (3) From Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture determines appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely to remain, free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.  (b) Honeybee semen may be imported into the United States only from:  (1) Countries determines by the Secretary of Agriculture to be free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees, and which have in operation precautions adequate to prevent the importation of such undesirable honeybees and their semen; or  (2) Canada or Mexico, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the region of Canada or Mexico from which the imports originate is, and is likely to remain, free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.            * * * * *      Done in Washington, DC, this 30th day of December, 1993.             <SIGNER>  Patricia Jensen,    </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB>  Acting Assistant Secretary, Marketing and Inspection Services.          </SIGNJOB>    [FR Doc. 94&hyph;200 Filed 1&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am]      <BILLING>  BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;34&hyph;P  </BILLING>

This final rule also incorporates the illustrative management letter issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in a Technical Practice Aid dated November 11, 1992.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Executive Order 12866        This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866.        Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification        The Administrator, REA, has determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601     et seq.    ) does not apply to this final rule.        Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements        In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implements the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) and section 3504 of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control number 0572&hyph;0095.

National Environmental Policy Act Certification        The Administrator, REA, has determined that this final rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321     et seq.    ). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment.

Executive Order 12372        This final rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation. A Notice of Final Rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA and Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) loans and loan guarantees, and RTB bank loans, to governmental and nongovernmental entities from coverage under this Order.        Executive Order 12778        This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule:    (1) Will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule;    (2) Will not have any retroactive effect; and     (3) Will not require administrative proceeding before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule.        Background        On December 3, 1991, REA published a final rule on part 1773, at 56 FR 63354, concerning audits of REA borrowers. Part 1773 implements the standard REA security instrument provision requiring REA borrowers to prepare and furnish to REA, at least once during each 12-month period, a full and complete report of its financial condition, operations, and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to REA, audited and certified by an independent CPA, satisfactory to REA, and accompanied by a report of such audit, in form and substance satisfactory to REA. A report of the audit was defined in &sect;1773.1 to include the auditor's report, report on compliance, report on internal controls and management letter.    The management letter is prepared by the CPA and addresses specific internal control, compliance, and other program issues not typically addressed in the standard auditor's report, report on internal controls, or report on compliance. The requirements for preparing a management letter are set forth in &sect;1773.34, Management Letter. This final rule revises and clarifies &sect;1773.34(e). Section 1773.34 (e)(1)(i) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34 (e)(2)(i) for telephone borrowers requires CPAs to test compliance with the loan and security instrument provision requiring borrowers to maintain insurance. REA is currently reviewing its insurance requirements to determine if these requirements are representative of current industry standards. Therefore, until such time as REA's review is completed and revisions, if any, to current policies are finalized, CPAs will not be required to test for compliance with the mortgage provision relating to insurance.                   <USBUREAU>Rural Electrification Administration</USBUREAU>      7 CFR Part 1773          <RINDOCK>RIN 0572&hyph;AA93</RINDOCK>        Policy on Audits of REA Borrowers       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Rural Electrification Administration, USDA.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This final rule revises and clarifies a provision of the current regulation which requires a certified public accountant (CPA) to state whether an electric borrower has complied with certain provisions of its loan and security instruments.

text: nullnull      Section 1773.34(e)(1)(ii) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(iii) for telephone borrowers requires CPAs to test for compliance with the loan and security instrument provision requiring funds to be deposited in banks or other depositories designated in the loan documents or approved by REA. Because of the many and varied investing activities available in today's economy, CPAs have questioned the definition of funds and what, if any, investments are affected. This final rule provides a definition of funds for purposes of applying this part 1773.    Section 1773.34(e)(1)(iv) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(iv) for telephone borrowers requires CPAs to review the financial and statistical report and state whether the information presented is in agreement with the borrower's records. CPAs have questioned whether they are required to review a certified copy of the report obtained directly from REA or whether they may review a copy represented by the borrower as having been submitted to REA. This final rule clarifies REA's requirement for CPAs to review a copy of the financial and statistical report represented by the borrower as having been submitted to REA.    Section 1773.34(e)(1)(iii) for electric borrowers and &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(ii) for telephone borrowers requires the CPA to state whether an REA borrower has complied with the provision of its loan and security instrument that requires a borrower to obtain written approval of mortgagees to enter into any contract for the operation or maintenance of all or any part of its property, or for the use of its property by others. This requirement clearly goes beyond the scope of government auditing standards because it requires all contracts, even those that have little or no impact on financial statement amounts, to be reviewed by the CPA for REA approval. This testing has, during the effective period of part 1773, translated into increased audit fees. To minimize the cost impact to REA borrowers yet provide REA the assurance it requires, this final rule details the contracts that must be reviewed by CPAs.    This final rule also incorporates the illustrative management letter, as amended by these part 1773 revisions, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in a Technical Practice Aid dated November 11, 1992. The illustrative letter properly addresses the management letter requirements set forth in 7 CFR 1773.34 and includes specific language to ensure compliance with the promulgated auditing literature. As such, REA believes it is more informative than the sample management letter previously provided in appendix C to part 1773.    Due to a procedural change within REA that will more efficiently process and review audit reports submitted by REA borrowers, this final rule also amends &sect;1773.3, &sect;1773.20, and &sect;1773.21 to require borrowers to submit to REA an additional copy of the audit, report on compliance, report on internal controls, and management letter and revises &sect;1773.21 to require the submission of an additional copy of borrowers' plans for corrective action.        Comments        A proposed rule entitled Policy on Audits of REA Borrowers, published September 23, 1993, at 58 FR 49442, invited interested parties to submit comments on or before November 22, 1993. Comments were received from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) and two certified public accounting firms. The comments submitted by NRECA were based upon an analysis performed by the Accounting &amp; Depreciation Committee, a subcommittee of the Generation and Transmission Managers Association Technical Advisory Committee, and were considered and concurred in by the NRECA Accounting and Tax Committee.    One accounting firm agreed with the proposed revisions in all respects. The other commenters agreed with the proposed revisions; however, proffered additional revisions. The following paragraphs address the additional revisions proposed by the commenters.        Comment.     Sections 1773.40 and 1773.45 state that the certified public accountant's (CPA) workpapers must document whether all regulatory assets and liabilities comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and have received REA approval. REA telephone borrowers that comply with generally accepted accounting principles as required by part 32 of the Federal Communications Commission's Rules and Regulations, Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies, are not required to obtain specific REA approval of regulatory assets and liabilities. Only REA electric borrowers must seek such approval. Sections 1773.40 and 1773.45 should be amended to specify that REA approval of regulatory assets and liabilities must only be documented for REA electric borrowers.        Response.     REA agrees with the comment and has revised &sect;1773.40 and &sect;1773.45 accordingly.

text: nullnull          Comment.     Section 1773.9(c) states that pursuant to the terms of its audit agreement with the borrower, the CPA must immediately report, in writing, all irregularities and all indications or instances of illegal acts, whether material or not to: (1) The president of the borrower's board of directors; (2) the Director, Borrowers Accounting Division; and (3) the Office of Inspector General. This requirement goes beyond that of generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS) which limits reporting requirements for irregularities to material instances and instances that cumulatively could have a material effect on the financial statements. GAGAS further limits the reporting of illegal acts to only the top official of the entity arranging for the audit. REA should modify the requirements set forth in &sect;1773.9(c) to correspond with the GAGAS requirements.        Response.     REA recognizes that certain procedures set forth in part 1773 exceed the requirements of a GAGAS audit and REA has acknowledged that fact in the rule. The Office of Inspector General, in Departmental Regulation No. 1700&hyph;1, Basic OIG Investigation/Audit Organization and Procedures, sets forth certain requirements that all Federal agencies within USDA must impose upon nonFederal auditors. One of these requirements is that all irregularities or illegal acts, regardless of materiality, discovered by nonFederal auditors be reported to the Federal agency requiring the audit and to OIG for appropriate action. For this reason, no revisions were made in the final rule.        Comment.     Section 1773.6(a)(2) states that ``The borrower and CPA acknowledge that REA regulations provide that if the borrower fails to have an audit performed and documented in compliance with GAGAS and this part, the borrower is in violation of its security instrument with REA''. This language exceeds the applicable mortgage covenant and the following language should be substituted: ``The borrower and CPA acknowledge that REA will consider the borrower to be in violation of its security instrument with REA if the borrower fails to have an audit performed and documented in compliance with   GAGAS and 7 CFR part 1773. This acknowledgement shall not be considered a contractual admission against interest by either the borrower or the CPA.''        Response.     REA's proposed rule published on September 23, 1993, did not include revisions to &sect;1773.6(a)(2). Therefore, comments on this section went beyond the scope of the proposal. REA is planning a separate rulemaking procedures that will include changes in &sect;1773.6(a)(2) and REA will be soliciting comments at that time.        Comment.     Certain disclosure and reporting requirements contained in &sect;1773.34 should include some consideration of materiality. The concept of materiality is inherent in all audits. Strict compliance with the existing policy has, however, resulted in reporting of immaterial items of non-compliance.        Response.      As previously discussed, REA recognizes that certain procedures set forth in part 1773 exceed the requirements of a GAGAS audit and REA has acknowledged that fact in the rule. Section 1773.34 sets forth REA's requirement that the CPA must prepare a management letter and establishes the testing and reporting requirements for the management letter.    Section 1773.34(e) sets forth certain provisions of REA's security instrument that REA has determined are essential to the security of its loans. CPAs auditing REA borrowers are, therefore, required to test for compliance with the security instrument provisions set forth in &sect;1773.34. Because of the degree of reliance that REA places on the CPAs' testing in these areas, REA has determined that materiality should not be a factor upon which testing is based. REA has, however, through the publication of this final rule, revised and eliminated many of the unclear or burdensome requirements set forth in part 1773. For this reason, no additional revisions were made to &sect;1773.34.

text: nullnull      Illustrative Independent Auditors' Management Letter        March 15, 19x6        Board of Directors  [    Name of Borrower    ]  [    City, State    ]             We have audited the financial statements of [    Name of Borrower    ] for the year ended December 31, 19x5, and have issued our report thereon dated March 15, 19x6. We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and 7 CFR part 1773, Policy on Audits of Rural Electrification Administration (REA) Borrowers. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.      In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of [    Name of Borrower    ] for the year ended December 31, 19x5, we considered its internal control structure in order to determine our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the financial statements and not to provide assurance on the internal control structure.    A description of the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining the internal control structure and the objectives of and inherent limitations in such a structure is set forth in our independent auditors' report on the internal control structure dated March 15, 19x6, and should be read in conjunction with this report.      Our consideration of the internal control structure would not necessarily disclose all matters in the internal control structure that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.    A material weakness is a condition in which the design or operation of the specific internal control structure elements does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that errors or irregularities in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions. However, we noted no matters involving the internal control structure and its operation that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above. [    If a material weakness was noted, refer the reader to the independent auditors' report on internal control structure.    ]    7 CFR 1773.34 requires comments on specific aspects of the internal control structure, compliance with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, and other additional matters. We have grouped our comments accordingly. In addition to obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements, at your request, we performed tests of specific aspects of the internal control structure, of compliance with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, and of additional matters. The specific aspects of the internal control structure, compliance with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, and additional matters tested include, among other things, the accounting procedures and records, materials control, compliance with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions set forth in 7 CFR 1773.34 (e)(1), [    for telephone borrowers, 7 CFR 1773.34 (e)(2)],     related party transactions, and depreciation rates. [    For electric borrowers    :] The additional matters tested also include a schedule of deferred debits and credits, upon which we express an opinion. In addition, our audit of the financial statements also included the procedures specified in 7 CFR 1773.38&hyph;.45. Our objective was not to provide an opinion on these specific aspects of the internal control structure, compliance with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, or additional matters, and accordingly, we express no opinion thereon.    No reports (other than our independent auditors' report, our independent auditors' compliance report, and our independent auditors' report on the internal control structure, all dated March 15, 19x6) or summary of recommendations related to our audit have been furnished to management.    Our comments on specific aspects of the internal control structure, compliance with specific REA loan and security instrument provisions, and other additional matters as required by 7 CFR 1773.34 are presented below.          Comments on Certain Specific Aspects of the Internal Control Structure        We noted no matters regarding [    Name of Borrower    ]'s internal control structure and its operation that we consider to be a material weakness as previously defined with respect to:           _The accounting procedures and records [    list other comments    ];    _The process for accumulating and recording labor, material, and overhead costs, and the distribution of these costs to construction, retirement, and maintenance or other expense accounts [    list other comments    ]; and,      _The materials control [    list other comments    ].

At your request, we have performed the procedures enumerated below with respect to compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, and contracts. The procedures we performed are summarized as follows:           _Procedure performed with respect to the requirement to maintain all funds in institutions whose accounts are insured by an Agency of the Federal Government:           1. Obtained information from financial institutions with which [    Name of Borrower    ] maintains funds that indicated that the institutions are insured by an Agency of the Federal Government.           _Procedures performed with respect to the requirement for a borrower to obtain written approval of the mortgagee to enter into any contract for the operation or maintenance of property, or for the use of mortgaged property by others [    see &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(i) for additional telephone borrower requirements in accordance with 7 CFR 1773.34(e)    ] for the year ended December 31, 19x5 of [    Name of Borrower    ]:           1. Obtained and read a borrower prepared schedule of new written contracts entered into during the year for the operation or maintenance of its property, or for the use of its property by others as defined in &sect;1773.34(e)(1)(ii) [    &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(i) for telephone borrowers    ].    2. Reviewed Board of Director minutes to ascertain whether board-approved written contracts are included in the borrower-prepared schedule.    3. Noted the existence of written REA [    and other mortgagee    ] approval of each contract listed by the borrower.           _Procedure performed with respect to the requirement to submit REA Form 7 or Form 12 [    Form 479 for telephone borrowers    ] to the REA:           1. Agreed amounts reported in Form 7 or Form 12 [    Form 479 for telephone borrowers    ] to [    Name of Borrower    ]'s records.    The results of our tests indicate that, with respect to the items tested, [    Name of Borrower    ] complied, except as noted below, in all material respects, with the specific REA loan and security instrument provisions referred to below. With respect to items not tested, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that [    Name of Borrower    ] had not complied, in all material respects, with those provisions. The specific provisions tested, as well as any exceptions noted, include the requirements that:           _The borrower maintains all funds in institutions whose accounts are insured by an Agency of the Federal Government [    list all exceptions    ];    _The borrower has obtained written approval of the REA [    and other mortgagees    ] to enter into any contract for the operation or maintenance of property, or for the use of mortgaged property by others as defined in &sect;1773.34(e)(1)(ii) [    &sect;1773.34(e)(2)(i) for telephone borrowers    ] [    list all exceptions    ]; and    _The borrower has submitted its Form 7 or Form 12 [    Form 479 for telephone borrowers    ] to the REA and the Form 7 or Form 12 [    Form 479 for telephone borrowers    ], Financial and Statistical Report, as of December 31 19x5, represented by the borrower as having been submitted to REA is in agreement with the [    Name of Borrower    ]'s records in all material respects [    list all exceptions    ].        Comments on Other Additional Matters        In connection with our audit of the financial statements of [    Name of Borrower    ], nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that [    Name of Borrower    ] failed to comply with respect to:           _The reconciliation of subsidiary plant records to the controlling general ledger plant accounts addressed at 7 CFR 1773.34(c)(1) [    list all exceptions    ];    _The clearing of the construction accounts and the accrual of depreciation on completed construction addressed at 7 CFR 1773.34(c)(2) [    list all exceptions    ];    _The retirement of plant addressed at 7 CFR 1773.34(c) (3) and (4) [    list all exceptions    ];    _Sales of plant material, or scrap addressed at 7 CFR 1773.34(c)(5) [    list all exceptions    ];    _The disclosure of material related party transactions, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57, Related Party Transactions, for the year ended December 31, 19x5, in the financial statements referenced in the first paragraph of this report addressed at 7 CFR 1773.34(f) [    list all exceptions    ]; and    _    For electric borrowers only    : depreciation rates addressed at 7 CFR 1773.34(g) [    list all exceptions    ].

text:   SUMMARY:     The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to reflect an administrative change in the procedure for notifying licensees of changes in the user fee charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for processing fingerprint cards as part of the criminal history checks that nuclear power reactor licensees are required to perform for those individuals granted unescorted access to an operating nuclear power facility or access to Safeguards Information. This notice also informs licensees of the new user fee adopted by the FBI effective January 3, 1994.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:             Background        The provisions of 10 CFR 73.57 requires licensees to process fingerprint cards through the NRC to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division which then does a criminal history check. A user fee for processing fingerprint cards was required by Congress (Pub. L. 99&hyph;399), is established by the FBI, and is periodically increased as the FBI's processing costs change.        Discussion        On December 3, 1993, the FBI's Division of Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the ``user fee'' charged by the FBI for processing fingerprint cards had been increased from $23.00 to $24.00 effective January 3, 1994. The FBI user fee includes a $2.00 handling cost for the agency doing the initial screening of the fingerprint cards, and provides that the agency doing the initial screening retains that handling cost. In the case of nuclear reactor licensees, the NRC performs this initial screening. The user fee is periodically changed by the FBI, as their processing costs change.    Because this amendment pertains only to a user-fee change imposed by the FBI, the Commission for good cause finds that the notice and public procedure provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act are impractical and unnecessary. Comment will not serve to alter the FBI fee, which is outside the control of the NRC. Further, rather than engaging in an unnecessary rulemaking procedure to amend the rule every time the FBI changes the fee, this amendment removes the fee amount from the rule. The Commission will advise licensees directly when the FBI fee changes. A notice of the FBI fee change pertaining to NRC licensees will also be published in the     Federal Register.        Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion        The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described as a categorical exclusion in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule.        Paperwork Reduction Act Statement        This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501     et seq.    ). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under approval number 3150&hyph;0002.        Backfit Analysis        The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to the action taken in this final rulemaking and, therefore, that a backfit analysis is not required for this final rule because this amendment does not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

This final rule established Class D airspace at Barking Sands Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), Kekaha, Kauai, Hawaii, effective January 10, 1994. This correction to the final rule will establish the Class D airspace at Barking Sands PMRF effective on March 3, 1994.

text:   SUMMARY:     The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is today issuing a final rule which amends the implementing regulations for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). A number of the revisions are required by the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1992, including provisions on: participation by foreign companies in ATP; the establishment of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act; and a new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures'' be industry-led. Further, requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under ATP have been repealed by the Act, and are thus removed from the regulations. Similarly, ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations has been repealed. Also, changes not required by the Act are made, including changes to simplify and clarify the selection criteria, and to streamline the internal operations of ATP, including the selection process.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The National Institute of Standards and Technology is today issuing a final rule which amends regulations found at part 295 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which implement the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). The Advanced Technology Program assists United States businesses to carry out high-risk research and development that will, if successful, improve the competitive position of the United States and its businesses by accelerating the development of technologies that have significant potential to stimulate economic growth, and raise productivity. ATP enters into cooperative agreements with United States joint research and development ventures and United States businesses, especially small businesses. Where appropriate, Federal laboratories may be involved in ATP projects consistent with other authority, such as cooperative research and development agreements under section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980.        Description of the Changes        Changes to part 295 include revisions on the following topics (please see the analysis of comments below for additional details):    &bull;The eligibility of foreign firms to participate in ATP is addressed in a new section 295.3 of the regulations, and a related definition of ``United States owned company'' is added in section 295.2(r). These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(9)).    &bull;The establishment of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;517, as amended) is set out at section 295.8(a). These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)). That statute requires that title to inventions made in whole or part with Program funds reside with for-profit companies that have been incorporated in the United States. Entities that are not for-profit organizations incorporated in this country are not eligible to obtain title to inventions made under the Program.    &bull;A new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures'' be industry-led, set out at &sect;&sect;295.2(i) and 295.21, and the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations, set out at &sect;295.30. These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively, of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)).    &bull;Requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under ATP have been repealed, and are thus removed from existing &sect;295.7(c) of the regulations. This revision follows the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991.    &bull;Finally, changes not required by the Act are made to the selection criteria, and to the internal operations of ATP, including the selection process. These changes particularly include revisions to the remaining definitions in &sect;295.2, changes to the selection process described in &sect;&sect;295.4 and 295.5, changes to the selection criteria as set out in &sect;295.6, and changes to program administration found in &sect;&sect;295.7 and 295.14.                               <USBUREAU>Technology Administration</USBUREAU>        15 CFR Part 295          <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 930242&hyph;3313]</RINDOCK>         <RINDOCK>RIN 0693&hyph;AA83</RINDOCK>        Advanced Technology Program         <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is today issuing a final rule which amends the implementing regulations for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP).

text: nullnull      Summary of Comments        On August 2, 1993, the Technology Administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the     Federal Register     (55 FR 41069). In response to this notice forty-four letters were received; twenty-nine from universities, ten from other not-for-profit research organizations and industry associations, one from a state agency, one from a U.S.-owned for-profit company, one from a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned corporation, one from a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and one from a member of the NIST staff.    All but four of the forty-four respondents, including all twenty-nine from universities and all ten from other not-for-profit organizations, commented on the proposed revision to the treatment of patent rights found in &sect;295.8. An additional two dozen comments were received concerning proposed changes to the proposed definitions set out in &sect;295.2. The remaining comments were scattered among several sections, including: five concerning new &sect;295.14, which deals with special financial reporting requirements; three on the revisions to the selection criteria found in &sect;295.5; two on the use of abbreviated proposals proposed in &sect;295.5; and one each on the provisions on the eligibility and qualification of applicants found in &sect;&sect;295.3 and 295.31. No comments were received in response to proposed changes to the following: &sect;295.1, pertaining to the purpose of the regulation; &sect;295.4, the selection process; &sect;295.7, pertaining to notices of availability of funds; &sect;295.21, on qualification of applicants; &sect;295.22, dealing with limitations on assistance; &sect;295.24, concerning registration under the antitrust laws; and &sect;295.30, which describes the types of assistance available.    The following is a section-by-section description of the comments received by NIST, and NIST's response to those comments.        Section 295.2&blank;Definitions_Comment Summary (24 Comments)        Twenty-three respondents, all universities or other nonprofit organizations, questioned whether the definition of ``United States-owned company'' found in &sect;295.2(r) of the proposed rule reflected the actual intent of Congress as stated in the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991. The definition of United States-owned company set out in &sect;295.2(r) is used in section 295.8 to determine eligibility to obtain title to inventions arising from assistance under ATP. A consolidated analysis of the issues raised by &sect;295.2(r) and 295.8 is presented in the discussion of &sect;295.8 later in this notice, and the reader is asked to refer to that discussion.    In addition to the issue described above, one respondent questioned the exclusion (by omission) of independent research and development (IR&amp;D) costs in the definition of matching funds found in &sect;295.2(1). IR&amp;D funds are generally generated through contracts funded by the federal government. The financial assistance regulations which are applicable to ATP awards, and particularly Attachment E to OMB Circular A&hyph;110, prohibit the use of federal funds as cost share or match unless specifically authorized by federal law. The rule follows closely the wording of the 1988 legislation and hence cannot be changed without congressional action. The purpose of the limitations on qualified matching funds is to obtain a meaningful and significant commitment of company resources towards ATP objectives, including support to additional R&amp;D beyond that which would have occurred without the ATP award.        Section 295.3&blank;Eligibility of United States and foreign-owned businesses_(1 Comment)        One U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-owned company requested that both eligibility requirements and cancellation requirements for foreign-owned applicants be made clearer and that they be consistent with present law and with H.R. 820. In response, NIST notes that H.R. 820 is not law, but rather is pending legislation in the Congress. NIST cannot base changes in rules upon proposed legislation that has not been enacted.        Section 295.5&blank;Use of Abbreviated Proposals in the Selection Process_(2 Comments)        Two respondents endorsed the use of abbreviated proposals. One respondent further proposed that abbreviated proposals address, and thus be evaluated on, scientific and technical criteria only. NIST has determined that business and economic factors are important factors in assessing the potential for success of a proposed project, and therefore must be considered in addition to the scientific and technical merit of the proposal.        Section 295.6&blank;Criteria for Selection_(3 Comments)        Two respondents endorsed the increased emphasis on ``scientific and technical merit'', one of whom suggested increasing its weight further to 40 percent. Another respondent took issue with the reduced weight for two proposers ``level of commitment'' and suggested increasing the weight for the ``commitment'' criteria to 30 percent by eliminating ``experience and qualifications'' as a separate criteria.

text: nullnull      In response to these comments, &sect;295.5 has been modified to increase the weight of the ``level of commitment'' to 20 percent, the level that exists in the regulation as it was promulgated in 1990. The weight given ``experience and qualifications'' has been reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent.         Section 295.8(a)&blank;Patent Rights_(40 Comments)        Forty comments were received concerning the proposed revision to &sect;295.8(a)(1), thirty-nine from universities and other nonprofit organizations opposed to the proposal, and one from a business supporting the proposal. Also, twenty-three of the thirty-nine commentors described above objected to the definition of ``United States-owned company'' found in &sect;295.2(r) of the proposed rule.     The term ``United States-owned company'' defined in &sect;295.2(r) is used in &sect;295.8(a)(1) to determine who is eligible to obtain title inventions arising from assistance under ATP. The definition states that an entity must be organized for profit-making purposes to be deemed a United States-owned company, and &sect;295.8(a)(1) states that only United States-owned companies may take title to inventions arising under the ATP. Taken together, the two sections prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from obtaining title to inventions arising under the ATP.     The thirty-nine universities and nonprofit commentors are strongly opposed to this outcome. The following objection is typical: ``The ATP legislation enables universities to participate in research funded through the program, and (we have) taken advantage of the opportunity to do so. However, the problem is that NIST has interpreted the ATP legislation to exclude universities from ownership of intellectual property resulting from ATP funded research.''     In the view of NIST, the decision to prevent universities and other nonprofit organizations from taking title to inventions is embedded in statute, and NIST has no alternative but to follow the law as it presently is written. As a result of comments received from both for-profit and nonprofit organizations, NIST recognizes that one ingredient for the successful implementation of joint ventures under ATP is a flexible patent policy. The participants in ATP joint ventures need the flexibility to determine for themselves the best means of commercializing the technology they develop. This, in turn, requires the flexibility to allocate intellectual property rights as the joint ventures best see fit. Accordingly, NIST is working with the Congress in an attempt to enact a patent policy for ATP that leaves the decisions on patent ownership to joint venture members. Should a change in the law be enacted, NIST would immediately implement it. In that case, NIST would rely on the ATP proposal evaluation criteria to assess the probability of subsequent commercialization based on the proposed intellectual property rights arrangement.     Section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)) states that intellectual property rights developed under ATP ``shall vest in a company or companies incorporated in the United States.'' In reaching the conclusion that the term ``company or companies'' refers to profit-making entities, NIST has been guided by the broader context of changes made to the ATP by the American Technology Preeminence Act. NIST believes that it was the intent of Congress to provide title to inventions directly to U.S. companies as the most effective means of assuring that research results enter the marketplace rapidly, and in the way most beneficial to United States businesses. In this context, NIST notes that the Act contains a new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures'' funded by ATP must be industry-led. NIST also notes the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to nonprofit independent research organizations. (See sections 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively, of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)).     Thus, NIST believes that the only reasonable reading of section 201(c)(6) is to interpret the term ``United States-owned company'' as referring to businesses, and specifically, to for-profit entities.

text: nullnull      Section 295.8 (b) and (c)&blank;Copyright and Publication_(24 Comments)      A number of universities have expressed fear that the new ATP rules will prevent universities or their employees from copyrighting their works. The fear is also raised that the ATP rule will require universities to get the permission of their for-profit collaborators before publishing their research findings. In response, NIST notes that the parts of the ATP rule dealing with the questions raised by these comments on copyright and publication were not proposed to be substantively changed in the     Federal Register     notice of August 2, 1993. In the old rule, the provision on copyright was found in &sect;295.5(b), and the treatment of publication of research results was found at &sect;295.8(d). In the new rule, the provision on copyright is found in &sect;295.8(b), and the treatment of publication of research results is at &sect;295.8(c).  Except for renumbering, the only change that NIST proposed for the old &sect;295.5(b) concerned the governmental use license that each ATP funding recipient is required to provide to NIST for any copyrighted data first produced in the performance of the ATP award. The scope of the governmental use license has been truncated by deleting the authority of the government to distribute computer programs first produced in the performance of the ATP award to users in the United States. The ability of funding recipients to copyright the works of their employees remains unchanged. Both the old and new versions of the ATP regulation state that ``funding recipients'' can copyright works made under ATP. Universities that receive funds under ATP are ``funding recipients''. They are funding recipients if they are members of joint ventures. They are funding recipients if they are subcontractors. Universities get copyright. Accordingly, no change is made to &sect;295.8(c) of the regulation based upon the comments described above.  Except for renumbering, the only change that NIST proposed for the old &sect;295.5(d) was to delete the first part of the first sentence. That sentence originally read: ``Although the program will encourage the timely publication of research results by funding recipients, the decision on whether to publish or not will be made by the funding recipient(s).'' In the proposed revision, the sentence was revised to read simply ``The decision on whether to publish or not will be made by the funding recipient(s).'' NIST believes that the regulation is very clear that the decision to publish shall be made by negotiated agreement of the funding recipients and that the for-profit members of a joint venture will not be able to dictate to universities on this matter. This provision has been part of every ATP award made since 1990, and no difficulties have arisen under it. Accordingly, no change is made to section 295.8(c) of the proposed regulation based upon the comments described above.      Section 295.14&blank;Special Financial Reporting_(5 Comments)      Two universities and three other not-for-profit organizations commented on proposed section 295.14, which would increase the flexibility of financial reporting requirements and encourage award recipients to retain independent CPA firms to perform audit services, while reserving the right of the Department of Commerce's Office of the Inspector General to determine the timing and nature of these services, and to conduct its own audit. The comments suggested a need for greater specificity as to the applicable OMB regulations which might apply and the conditions under which the Departmental Inspector General would exercise his authority in setting the time frame and scope of audit services.  In response, the regulations have been amended to state that the audit principles to be applied to ATP awards are the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) according to the General Accounting Office's ``Government Auditing Standards'' subtitled ``Standards for Auditing Government Organization, Program, Activities and Functions''. Clarifying changes have also been made to the definitions of ``direct costs'' found at &sect;295.2(c) and ``indirect costs'' found at &sect;295.2(h).

text: nullnull      One respondent urged that state and local governments and U.S. universities and non-profit research institutes working independently should be eligible to receive individual ATP awards outside of joint ventures. No change has been made to the regulation based upon this comment because eligibility for individual awards is expressly limited to United States companies by section 278n(b)(2) of title 15 of the United States Code.        Effective Date of the Final Rule        This final rule relating to grants, benefits, and contracts is exempt from the delayed effective date requirement, and accordingly, under section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), is therefore being made effective immediately without a 30 day delay in effective date.        Classification        This document was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The General Counsel certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, at the time this rule was proposed that, if it were adopted as proposed it would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities requiring a flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This is because there are only a small number of awardees and thus only a small number of awards will be given to small businesses. The program is entirely voluntary for the participants that seek funding. It is not a major federal action requiring an environmental assessment under the National Environment Policy Act. This rule contains collection of information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act approved by OMB under control number 0693&hyph;0009. The Advanced Technology Program does not involve the mandatory payment of any matching funds from a state or local government, and does not affect directly any state or local government. Accordingly, the Technology Administration has determined that Executive Order 12372 is not applicable to this program. This notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.

text: nullnull           For reasons set forth in the preamble, title 15, part 295 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:          PART 295_ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM          1. The authority citation for part 295 is revised to read as follows:                       Authority:     15 U.S.C. 278n.                   2. Section 295.1 is revised to read as follows:          &sect;295.1    Purpose.        (a) The purpose of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) is to assist United States businesses to carry out research and development on pre-competitive generic technologies. These technologies are: (1) Enabling, because they offer wide breadth of potential application and form an important technical basis for future commercial applications; and (2) high value, because when applied, they offer significant benefits to the U.S. economy. Precompetitive technology is defined in &sect;295.2(n) and generic technology is defined in &sect;295.2(e).      (b) In the case of joint research and development ventures involving potential competitors, the willingness of firms to commit significant amounts of corporate resources to the venture is evidence that the proposed research and development is precompetitive. For joint ventures that involve firms and their customers or suppliers or for single firms not proposing cooperative research and development, a quantified description of the expected broad applicability of the technology and adequate assurances that the technology being developed will be utilized widely can provide evidence that the proposed research and development is pre-competitive.      (c) These rules prescribe policies and procedures for the award of cooperative agreements under the advanced Technology Program in order to ensure the fair treatment of all proposals. While the Advanced Technology Program is authorized to enter into grants, competitive agreements, and contracts to carry out its mission, these rules address only the award of cooperative agreements. The Program employs cooperative agreements rather than grants because such agreements allow ATP to exercise appropriate management oversight of projects and also to link ATP-funded projects to ongoing R&amp;D at the National Institute of Standards and Technology wherever such linkage would increase the likelihood of success of the project.      3. Section 295.2 is amended by revising paragraph (a), redesignating paragraphs (d) through (i) as paragraphs (k) through (p), redesignating paragraph (b) as paragraph (e) , redesignating paragraph (c) as paragraph (h), and adding new paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (i), and (j) to read as follows:         &sect;295.2          Definitions.          (a) For the purposes of the ATP, the term     award     means Federal financial assistance made under a grant or cooperative agreement.          * * * * *          (b) The term     cooperative agreement     refers to a Federal assistance instrument used whenever the principal purpose of the relationship between the Federal Government and the recipient is the transfer of money, property, or services, or anything of value to the recipient to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute, rather than acquisition by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; and substantial involvement is anticipated between the executive agency, acting for the Federal Government, and the recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.      (c) The term     direct costs     means costs that can be identified readily with activities carried out in support of a particular final objective. Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of different organizations, it is not possible to specify the types of costs which may be classified as direct costs in all situations. However, typical direct costs could include salaries of personnel assigned to the ATP project and associated normal fringe benefits such as medical insurance. Direct costs might also include supplies and materials, special equipment required specifically for the ATP project, and travel associated with the ATP project. ATP shall interpret direct costs in accordance with 48 CFR part 31 or OMB Circular A&hyph;122, attachment B.      (d) The term     foreign-owned company     means a company other than a United States-owned company as defined in &sect;295.2(r).          * * * * *          (f) The term     grant     means a Federal assistance instrument used whenever the principal purpose of the relationship between the Federal Government and the recipient is the transfer of money, property, services, or anything of value to the recipient in order to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute, rather than acquisition by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government; and no substantial involvement is anticipated between the executive agency, acting for the Federal Government, and the recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.

The venture may include additional companies, independent research organizations, universities, and/or government laboratories which may or may not contribute funds to the project and perform research and development. An independent research organization may perform administrative tasks on behalf of an industry-led joint research and development venture, such as handling receipts and disbursements of funds and making antitrust filings.    (j) The term     intellectual property     means an invention patentable under title 35, United States Code, or any patent on such an invention.        * * * * *        4.

A cost may not be allocated to an award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been assigned to an award as a direct cost. Because of diverse characteristics and accounting practices it is not possible to specify the types of costs which may be classified as indirect costs in all situations. However, typical examples of indirect costs include general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, maintenance, library expenses, and accounting. ATP shall interpret indirect costs in accordance with 48 CFR part 31 or OMB Circular A&hyph;122, Attachment C.    5. The newly designated &sect;295.2(k)(1)(v) is revised and (k)(1)(vi) is added, to read as follows:        &sect;295.2        Definitions.        * * * * *        (k)(1) *&blank;*&blank;*        * * * * *        (v) The production of any product, process, or service; or   (vi) any combination of the purposes specified in paragraphs (k)(1), (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this section, and may include the establishment and operation of facilities for the conducting of research, the conducting of such venture on a protected and proprietary basis, and the prosecuting of applications for patents and the granting of licenses for the results of such venture, but does not include any activity specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this definition.        * * * * *        6. The newly designated &sect;295.2(l) is revised to read as follows:        &sect;295.2      Definitions.      * * * * *        (l) The term     matching funds     includes the following: (1) Dollar contributions from state, county, city, company, or other non-federal sources;   (2) in-kind contributions of full-time personnel (i.e., persons employed full time by the joint venture or one of the joint venture members);   (3) in-kind contributions of a pro-rata share of part-time personnel that the Program deems essential to carrying out the proposed experimental work program and who devote at least 50% of their time to the program; and   (4) in-kind value of equipment that the Program deems essential to carrying out the proposed experimental work program, which may include either the purchase cost of new equipment or the depreciated value of previously purchased equipment. The depreciation method to be used for the matching fund determination shall be the internal depreciation accounting method used by the applicant for that equipment prior to the award. The value of equipment will be further pro-rated according to the share of total use dedicated to carrying out the proposed ATP work program. The total value of equipment expenditures allowable under the match may be applied in the award year expended or pro-rated over the duration of award years. The total in-kind value of equipment expenditures can not exceed 30% of the applicant's total annual share of matching funds. The total in-kind value of part-time personnel can not exceed 20% of the applicant's total annual share of matching funds.        * * * * *        7.

Sections 295.3 through 295.10 are redesignated as &sect;&sect;295.6 through 295.13, and newly designated &sect;&sect;295.3 through 295.5 are added to read as follows:        &sect;295.3     Eligibility of United States- and foreign-owned businesses.        (a) A company shall be eligible to receive an award from the Program only if:    (1) The Program finds that the company's participation in the Program would be in the economic interest of the United States, as evidenced by investments in the United States in research, development, and manufacturing (including, for example, the manufacture of major components or subassemblies in the United States); significant contributions to employment in the United States; and agreement with respect to any technology arising from assistance provided by the Program to promote the manufacture within the United States of products resulting from that technology (taking into account the goals of promoting the competitiveness of United States industry), and to procure parts and materials from competitive suppliers; and     (2) Either the company is a United States-owned company, or the Program finds that the company is incorporated in the United States and has a parent company which is incorporated in a country which affords to United States-owned companies opportunities, comparable to those afforded to any other company, to participate in any joint venture similar to those authorized under the Program; affords the United States-owned companies local investment opportunities comparable to those afforded to any other company; and affords adequate and effective protection for the intellectual property rights of United States-owned companies.    (b) The Program may, within 30 days after notice to Congress, suspend a company or joint venture from continued assistance under the Program if the Program determines that the company, the country of incorporation of the company or a parent company, or the joint venture has failed to satisfy any of the criteria contained in paragraph (a) of this section, and that it is in the national interest of the United States to do so.         &sect;295.4     The selection process.        (a) The selection process for awards is a multi-step process based on the criteria listed in &sect;295.6. In the first step, called ``preliminary screening,'' proposals are eliminated that do not meet the requirements of this rule or the program announcement. Typical but not exclusive of the reasons for eliminating a proposal at this stage is that the proposal: is deemed to have serious deficiencies in either the technical or business plan; or does not meet the definition of precompetitive, generic technology; or, is not industry-led; or is significantly overpriced or underpriced given the scope of the work; or does not meet the requirements set out in the Notice of Availability of Funds issued pursuant to &sect;295.7; or in the case of joint ventures, requests more than a minority share of funding. NIST will also examine proposals that have been submitted to a previous competition to determine whether substantive revisions have been made to the earlier proposal, and if not, may reject the proposal or forward it to a later stage in the review process based upon the earlier review.     (b) In the second step, referred to as the ``technical and business review,'' proposals are evaluated under the criteria found in &sect;295.6. Proposals are rated as ``not recommended'' or ``recommended.'' Proposals must have high scientific and technical merit to be recommended. Only those proposals rated as ``recommended'' are considered further. These applicants are referred to as ``semifinalists.''    (c) In the third step, referred to as ``selection of finalists,'' the Program prepares a final scoring and ranking of semifinalist proposals. During this step, the semifinalist proposers may be asked to make oral presentations on their proposals at NIST, and in some cases site visits may be required. Subject to the provisions of &sect;295.6, a list of ranked finalists is submitted to the selecting official.

text: nullnull      (d) In the final step, referred to as ``selection of awardees,'' the Selecting Official selects funding recipients from among the finalists, based upon (1) the rank order of the applications on the basis of all selection criteria (&sect;295.6); (2) assuring an appropriate distribution of funds among technologies and activities, and (3) the availability of funds. The Program reserves the right to withhold awards in any case where a search of Federal records discloses information that raises a reasonable doubt as to the responsibility of the applicant. The decision of the Selecting Official is final.    (e) If a joint venture is ranked as a finalist, but the Program determines that the joint venture contains weaknesses in its structure or cohesiveness that may substantially lessen the probability of the proposed program being completed successfully, the Program may inform the applicant of the deficiencies and enter into negotiations with the applicant in an effort to remedy the deficiencies. If appropriate, funding up to 10 percent of the amount originally requested by the applicant may be awarded by the Program to the applicant to assist in overcoming the organizational deficiencies. If the Program determines within six months of this award that the organizational deficiencies have been corrected, the Program may award the remaining funds requested by the applicant to that applicant.    (f) NIST reserves the right to negotiate with applicants selected to receive awards the cost and scope of the proposed work, e.g., to add or delete a task to improve the probability of success.        &sect;295.5    Use of abbreviated proposals in the selection process.        To reduce proposal preparation costs incurred by applicants and to make the selection process more efficient, NIST may use a preliminary qualification process based on abbreviated proposals. Announcements requesting abbreviated proposals will be published as indicated in &sect;295.7, seeking proposals that address all of the selection criteria, but in considerably less detail than full proposals. The Program will review the abbreviated proposals and select those that best meet the selection criteria. Submitters of abbreviated proposals will be notified in writing whether their proposals are recommended for full proposal, or, not recommended for full proposal. Those whose proposals are recommended for full proposal submission will be invited to prepare and submit full proposals. Those not invited to submit proposals may nonetheless elect to do so, and will have an equal opportunity for selection. When the full proposals are received, the review and selection process will continue as described in &sect;295.4.    10. Section 295.6 is revised to read as follows:        &sect;295.6    Criteria for selection.        The evaluation criteria to be used in selecting any proposal for funding under this program, and their respective weights, are listed in this section. No proposal will be funded unless the Program determines via the technical review that it has high scientific and technical merit, no matter how meritorious the proposal might be with respect to the other selection criteria.        (a) Scientific and Technical Merit of the Proposal (30 Percent)        (1) Quality, innovativeness, and cost-effectiveness of the proposed technical program, i.e. uniqueness with respect to current industry practice. Applicants shall compare and contrast their approaches with those taken by other domestic and foreign companies working in the same field.    (2) Appropriateness of the technical risk and feasibility of the project; that is, is there a sufficient knowledge base to justify the level of technical risk involved, and is the risk commensurate with the potential payoff. Projects should press the state of the art while still demonstrating feasibility.    (3) Coherency of technical plan and clarity of vision of technical objectives, and the degree the technical plan meets Program goals.

(5) Potential broad impact on U.S. technology and knowledge base.      (b) Potential Broad-based Economic Benefits of the Proposal (20 Percent)      (1) Potential to improve U.S. economic growth.  (2) Timeliness of proposal; that is, the potential project results will not occur too late or too early to be competitively useful.  (3) Degree to which ATP support is essential for the achievement of the broad-based benefits from the proposed R&amp;D and appropriateness of proposed R&amp;D for ATP support. This factor takes into consideration the likelihood of the results being achieved in the same general time frame by the applicant or by other U.S. researchers without ATP support, and whether other Federal agencies or other sponsors are already funding very similar kinds of work.  (4) Cost-effectiveness of proposal.      (c) Adequacy of Plans for Eventual Commercialization (20 Percent)      (1) Evidence that if the project is successful, the applicants will pursue further development of the technology toward commercial application, either through their own organization(s) or through others.  (2) Degree to which proposal identifies potential applications of the technology and provides evidence that the applicant has credible plans to assure prompt and widespread use of the technology if the R&amp;D is successful and to ensure adequate protection of the intellectual property by the participant(s) and, as appropriate, by other U.S. businesses.      (d) Proposer's Level of Commitment and Organizational Structure (20 Percent)      (1) Level of commitment of proposer as demonstrated by contribution of personnel, equipment, facilities, and cost-sharing. Extent to which the proposer assigns the company's best people to the project. Priority given to this work vis-a-vis other projects.  (2) For joint ventures, the extent to which the joint venture has been structured (vertical integration, horizontal integration, or both) so as to include sufficient participants possessing all of the skills required to complete successfully the proposed work.   (3) For joint ventures, appropriate participation by small businesses. ``Small business'' is defined in &sect;295.2(q).  (4) Appropriateness of subcontractor/supplier/collaborator participation and relationships (where applicable).  (5) Clarity and appropriateness of management plan. Extent to which the proposers have clarified who is responsible for each task, and the chain of command. Extent to which those responsible for the work have adequate authority and access to higher level management.      (e) Experience and Qualifications of the Proposing Organization (10 Percent)      (1) Adequacy of proposer's facilities, equipment, and other technical, financial, and administrative resources to accomplish the proposed program objectives. This factor includes consideration of resources possessed by subcontractors to the applicant or other collaborators.   (2) Quality and appropriateness of the technical staff to carry out the proposed work program and to identify and overcome barriers to meeting project objectives.  (3) Past performance of the company or joint venture members in carrying out similar kinds of efforts successfully, including technology application. Consideration of this factor in the case of a start-up company or new joint venture, will take into account the past performance of the key people in carrying out similar kinds of efforts.  11.

The United States may reserve a non-exclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United Sates any such intellectual property, but shall not, in the exercise of such license, publicly disclose proprietary information related to the license. Title to any such intellectual property shall not be transferred or passed, except to a company incorporated in the United States, until the expiration of the first patent obtained in connection with such intellectual property. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit the licensing to any company of intellectual property rights arising from assistance provided under this section.      (2)     Patent procedures:     Each award by the Program will contain procedures regarding reporting of inventions by the funding recipient to the Program; determinations by the Program as to whether it will retain a governmental use license; march-in rights, and other matters.      (b)     Copyrights:     Except as otherwise specifically provided for in an Award, funding recipients under the Program may establish claim to copyright subsisting in any data first produced in the performance of the award. When claim is made to copyright, the funding recipient shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship to the data when and if the data are delivered to the Government, are published, or are deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The funding recipient shall grant to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and for data other than computer software to distribute to the public by or on behalf of the Government.    (c)     Publication of research results:     The decision on whether or not to publish research results will be made by the funding recipient(s). Unpublished intellectual property owned and developed by any business or joint research and development venture receiving funding or by any member of such a joint venture may not be disclosed by any officer or employee of the Federal Government except in accordance with a written agreement between the owner or developer and the Program. The licenses granted to the Government under &sect;295.8(b) shall not be considered a waiver of this requirement.      13. Section 295.14 is added to read as follows:        &sect;295.14    Special financial reporting requirements.          Each award by the Program shall contain procedures regarding financial reporting to ensure that awards are being used in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;122_``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations'', Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 31_``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures'', or other sound accounting practices to be specified in the Cooperative Agreement. The audit principles to be applied to ATP awards are the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) according to the General Accounting Office's ``Government Auditing Standards'' subtitled ``Standards for Auditing Government Organization, Program, Activities and Functions''. Each award will be subject to an Attestation Engagement (i.e., providing assurance on representations of compliance with statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements) or an audit in conjunction with the recipient's annual audit at least every two years. In the interest of efficiency, the recipients are encouraged to retain their own independent CPA firm to perform these services. The Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General (OIG) reserves the right to determine the time frame and/or level of service of financial audit reports that are to be delivered and to determine how the close-out audit is to be conducted. The use of an independent CPA firm does not preclude the OIG's right to conduct its own audit.      14.

We have made no revisions in the medical criteria in the cardiovascular system listings; they remain the same as they now appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. We are presently considering comments we received on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to update the medical criteria contained in part A and part B of the cardiovascular system listings. When we have completed our review, any revised criteria will be published as final regulations.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On December 6, 1985, a revised Listing of Impairments in appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 was published in the     Federal Register     (50 FR 50068). The Listing of Impairments describes, for each of 13 major body systems, impairments that are considered severe enough to preclude a person from engaging in any gainful activity (part A), or in the case of a child under the age of 18, impairments that are considered severe enough to prevent the child from functioning independently, appropriately, and effectively in an age-appropriate manner (part B). The Listing of Impairments is used for evaluating disability and blindness at the third step of the sequential evaluation process for adults and children under the Social Security disability program and the supplemental security income program.        When the revised Listing of Impairments was published in 1985, we indicated that medical advances in disability evaluation and treatment and program experience would require that the listings be periodically reviewed and updated. Accordingly, we established termination dates ranging from 4 to 8 years for each of the listings for specific body systems. A date of December 6, 1989, was established for the cardiovascular system listings in part A to no longer be effective. A date of December 6, 1993, was established for part B of the cardiovascular system listings to no longer be effective.    The potential program impact of the changes to update the cardiovascular system listings required careful analysis and consideration within the Agency. As our analysis continued, it became evident that we would be unable to publish a proposed and then a final regulation containing revised criteria for part A of the cardiovascular system listings by December 6, 1989. We published in the     Federal Register     of December 5, 1989 (54 FR 50233), a final regulation extending the current part A cardiovascular system listings for a period of 18 months through June 5, 1991. The part A cardiovascular system listings were again extended an additional 12 months through June 5, 1992, by final regulation published in the     Federal Register     on June 6, 1991 (56 FR 26030), and were extended to January 5, 1993, by final regulation published in the     Federal Register     on June 5, 1992 (57 FR 23945), and to July 6, 1993, by final regulation published in the     Federal Register     on December 29, 1992 (57 FR 61795). The part A and part B cardiovascular system listings were extended to January 6, 1994, by final regulation published in the     Federal Register     on July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36133).                           <USBUREAU>Social Security Administration</USBUREAU>        20 CFR Part 404          <RINDOCK>[Regulations No. 4]</RINDOCK>         <RINDOCK>RIN 0960_None Assigned</RINDOCK>        Federal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance; Determining Disability and Blindness; Extension of Expiration Date for Cardiovascular System Listing       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Social Security Administration, HHS.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     We are extending the date on which parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings, found in appendix 1 of part 404, subpart P, will no longer be effective from January 6, 1994, to February 15, 1994.

text: nullnull      On July 9, 1991, we published an NPRM proposing revisions to the medical criteria contained in parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings (56 FR 31266), with provisions for a 60-day comment period. The complex issues raised by the numerous comments we received have required extensive analysis and careful consideration. In order to ensure sufficient time for this review, we are extending the date on which the current cardiovascular system listings in parts A and B will no longer be effective from January 6, 1994, to February 15, 1994.        Regulatory Procedures        The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy, generally follows the Administrative Procedure Act notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its regulations. The Administrative Procedure Act provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists for waiver of notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment procedures on this rule because it only extends the dates on which parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings will no longer be effective and makes no substantive changes to these listings. The current regulations expressly provide that the listings may be extended by the Secretary, as well as revised and promulgated again. Because we are not making any revisions to the current listings, we have determined that use of public comment procedures is unnecessary under the Administrative Procedure Act.        Regulatory Flexibility Act        We certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.        Paperwork Reduction Act        This regulation imposes no reporting or recordkeeping requirements necessitating clearance by the Office of Management and Budget.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this final rule to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to the emergency scheduling provisions of the CSA. This action is based on the finding by the Acting Administrator of the DEA that the placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in Schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this rule, the criminal sanctions and regulatory controls of Schedule I substances under the CSA will be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, and possession of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;473) amended section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 811) to give the Attorney General the authority to temporarily place a substance into Schedule I of the CSA if it is found that such action is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. A substance may be temporarily scheduled under the emergency provision of the CSA if that substance is not listed in any other schedule under Section 202 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 812) of if there is no approval or exemption in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the substance. The Attorney General has delegated his authority under 21 U.S.C. 811 to the Administrator of the DEA (28 CFR 0.100).        A notice of intent to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA was published in the     Federal Register     on November 4, 1993, (58 FR 58819). The Administrator transmitted notice of his intention to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA to the Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In response to this notification, the Food and Drug Administration has advised DEA that there are no exemptions or approvals in effect under 21 U.S.C. 355 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine and HHS has no objection to DEA's intention to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA. No other comments were received regarding this matter.    In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(h)(3), the Acting Administrator has considered the following factors regarding 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine: (1) Its history and current pattern of abuse; (2) scope, duration and significance of abuse; and (3) what, if any, risk there is to the public health.    4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is structurally similar to the Schedule I phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens, 4-methyl-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (STP or DOM) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (DOB). Like DOM and DOB, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine displays high affinity for central serotonin receptors and is capable of substituting for either DOM or DOB in drug discrimination studies conducted in rats. These data suggest that 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is a psychoactive substance capable of producing effects similar, though not identical, to DOM and DOB. Data from human studies indicate that 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is orally active at 0.1&hyph;0.2 mg/kg producing an intoxication with considerable euphoria and sensory enhancement which lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Higher doses have been reported to produce intense and frightening hallucinations.                           <USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>        21 CFR Part 1308         Schedules of Controlled Substances Temporary Placement of 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine Into Schedule I       <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice.         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.              </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     The Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this final rule to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to the emergency scheduling provisions of the CSA.

text: nullnull      DEA first encountered 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in Texas in 1979. Since that time, several other exhibits of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine have been analyzed by DEA and state forensic laboratories in California, Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Oregon, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. Clandestine laboratories producing 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine were seized in California in 1986 and in Arizona in 1992. It has been represented as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and has been sold in sugar cubes as LSD. More recently, it has been promoted as an aphrodisiac and distributed under the product name of NEXUS whose purported active ingredient is brominated cathinine. DEA has recently seized several thousand dosage units of this product.     The continued clandestine production, illicit importation, distribution and abuse of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine poses an imminent hazard to public safety. DEA is not aware of any commercial use for this substance in the United States.     In accordance with the provisions of section 201(h) of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)) and 28 CFR 0.100 and based on a consideration of the requisite factors and other relevant information, the Acting Administrator finds that placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA on a temporary basis is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.    The following regulations are effective with respect to 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine on January 6, 1994, except for those individuals registered with DEA in accordance with part 1301 or part 1311 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, who currently possess 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine may continue to do so pending DEA's receipt of an application for amended registration no later than February 7, 1994:     1. Registration. Any person who manufactures, distributes, delivers, imports or exports 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine or who engages in research or conducts instructional activities with respect to 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine or who proposes to engage in such activities must be registered to conduct such activities in accordance with parts 1301 and 1311 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.    2. Security. 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine must be manufactured, distributed and stored in accordance with &sect;&sect;1301.71 through 1301.76 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.     3. Labeling and Packaging. All labels and labeling for commercial containers of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine must comply with requirements of &sect;&sect;1302.03 through 1302.05, 1302.7 and 1302.08 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.    4. Quotas. All persons required to obtain quotas for 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine must submit applications pursuant to &sect;&sect;1303.12 and 1303.22 of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.      5. Inventory.

text: nullnull      The Acting Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601     et seq    . This action involves the temporary control of a substance with no currently approved medical use in the United States.  The temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 30, 1993. Drug scheduling matters are not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the provisions of E.O. 12866, section 3(d)(1). Accordingly, this proposed emergency scheduling action is not subject to provisions of E.O. 12778 which are contingent upon review by OMB. This regulation both responds to an emergency situation posing an imminent hazard to the public safety, and is essential to a criminal law enforcement function of the United States.  This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined that the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

text:   SUMMARY:     A special local regulation is being adopted for the Operation Anzio Reenactment training exercise which the U.S. Army will hold on the Ohio River near Fort Knox, Kentucky on January 20&hyph;22, 1994. This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the immediate vicinity of the event. The regulation will restrict general navigation in the regulated area for the safety of spectators, participants and through traffic.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Drafting Information          The drafters of these regulations are LTJG D.R. Dean, Project Officer, Second Coast Guard District, Boating Safety Division and LCDR A.O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.        Regulatory History        In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the sponsor's late submission of the regatta application left insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in advance of the scheduled event. However, the Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation now as the benefits of holding the training during the winter, as scheduled, rather than later in the spring will mean less impact on the boating public.        Background and Purposes        Operation Anzio Reenactment consists of river crossing training for the 19th Engineer Battalion, Fort Knox, Kentucky. The Training will take place over three days, January 20&hyph;22, 1994. Each day's training will begin at 12 p.m., and will end at 3 p.m. local time. In order to provide for the safety of spectators and participants, and for the safe passage of through traffic, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regatta area. The river will be closed during part or all of the effective period to all vessel traffic except participants, official regatta vessels, and patrol craft. These regulations are issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 and 33 CFR 100.35.        Regulatory Evaluation        This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal due to its short duration.        Federalism Assessment        Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.        Environmental Assessment        Under section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this regulation is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

text: nullnull      Discussion of Regulation        The circumstances creating the need for this regulation is information received by Chevron and by the Coast Guard that vessels intend to protest and possibly interfere with drilling operations at this site. This is the first site at which drilling will begin in this particular area, which has been a subject of controversy. Precautionary measures for safety at a drilling site require that the structure and waters around it be maintained free of interference and traffic in order to allow for immediate evacuation of personnel aboard the structure and by attending vessels in case of emergency. The establishment of a safety zone will prevent non-attending vessels from remaining in close proximity to the offshore structure and hindering any necessary evacuation of the area.    The final rule amends part 147 to add a temporary safety zone around the Chevron Well     #    1, Destin Dome     #    97, which is about 27 miles south of Pensacola, Florida. The regulation contains a description of the area of the safety zone, including the location of the center of the structure and information pertinent to the safety zone. The regulations restrict the entry of vessels into the safety zone, except for attending vessels and those vessels authorized by the Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District.        Economic Assessment and Certification        This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is nonsignificant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic impact has been found to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The Coast Guard certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.        Federalism Assessment        This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this rulemaking does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.        Environmental Assessment        The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for examination or a copy may be obtained by contracting the person identified under ``    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Upper Mississippi River. This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the regulated area to provide safe working conditions and navigation within the affected area. The regulation will prohibit navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property associated with bridge and span removal.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   Drafting Information         The drafters of this regulation are MK1 Christopher C. Schulz, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, St. Louis, Missouri and LCDR A. O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.         Regulatory History       In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the nature of repairs to the Burlington Highway Bridge at mile 404.2 Upper Mississippi River leaves insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rule making. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting for a comment period since the conditions present an immediate hazard.         Background and Purpose       Extensive renovation of the bridge is required and removal of the center is to be accomplished from a vessel located in the navigation channel and this action will impede normal traffic flow. As a result of these conditions this regulation is necessary to provide safe working conditions and navigation within the affected area.         Regulatory Evaluation       This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements.     The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The imposed restrictions are anticipated to be of short duration. To avoid any unnecessary adverse economic impact on businesses which use the river for commercial purposes, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri will monitor the situation and will authorized entry into the closed area as conditions warrant. Changes will be announced by Marine Safety Information Radio Broadcast on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHZ). Mariners may also call the Port Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823 for current information.         Federalism Assessment       Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.         Environmental Assessment         The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.[5] of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an action to protect public safety.

This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the regulated area to provide safe working conditions and navigation within the affected area. The regulation will prohibit navigation in the regulated area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property associated with bridge and span removal.          </SUMMARY> <DATE>  EFFECTIVE DATES:     This regulation is effective December 21, 1993 and will terminate on January 21, 1994 unless sooner terminated by the Captain of the Port.        </DATE>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     LT Timothy Deal, Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823.         <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:   Drafting Information         The drafters of this regulation are MK1 Christopher C. Schulz, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, St. Louis, Missouri and LCDR A. O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.         Regulatory History       In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the nature of repairs to the Burlington Highway Bridge at mile 404.2 Upper Mississippi River leaves insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rule making. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting for a comment period since the conditions present an immediate hazard.         Background and Purpose       Extensive renovation of the bridge is required and removal of the center is to be accomplished from a vessel located in the navigation channel and this action will impede normal traffic flow. As a result of these conditions this regulation is necessary to provide safe working conditions and navigation within the affected area.         Regulatory Evaluation       This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements.     The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The imposed restrictions are anticipated to be of short duration. To avoid any unnecessary adverse economic impact on businesses which use the river for commercial purposes, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri will monitor the situation and will authorized entry into the closed area as conditions warrant. Changes will be announced by Marine Safety Information Radio Broadcast on VHF Marine Band Radio, Channel 22 (157.1 MHZ). Mariners may also call the Port Operations Officer, Captain of the Port, St. Louis, Missouri at (314) 539&hyph;3823 for current information.         Federalism Assessment       Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.         Environmental Assessment         The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.[5] of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an action to protect public safety.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the   Youghiogheny River from mile 0.8 to mile 1.8. This regulation is   needed to control vessel traffic in the regulated area during   demolition of the main span of a bridge at mile 1.3. This   regulation will restrict general navigation in the regulated area   during demolition and subsequent debris clearing operations for   the safety of vessels transitting the area.                SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Drafting Information          The drafters of this regulation are LT John Meehan, Project   Officer, Marine Safety Office, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and LCDR   A.O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.          Regulatory History          In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, a bridge is being removed from a navigable waterway. Bridge removal operations pose inherent risks to the waterway because the structure is progressively weakened as the operation proceeds. Once commenced, such operations should be completed as quickly as possible. Removal operations involving structural supports for this bridge have proceeded ahead of schedule, leaving insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation without waiting for a comment period, as immediate implementation of navigation restrictions is needed to ensure the safety of vessels transitting the area and to minimize the time a bridge in a weakened condition remains over the waterway.          Background and Purpose          The Port Vue Bridge located at mile 1.3 on the Youghiogheny River is not longer an active highway bridge and must be removed. The bridge consists of several small spans that are located over land and one 310-foot main span that crosses over the navigable waterway. As part of the overall bridge removal operation, this main span will be demolished with five simultaneously detonated explosive charges. This explosion, which will create an obvious hazard to vessels transitting the area, will occur at approximately 10 a.m. on January 8, 1994. After the explosives on this span are detonated, the steel and other debris from the bridge will fall into the navigable waters of the Youghiogheny River, creating an unsafe condition of vessels. The contractor will immediately commence clearing operations, but it will require 48 hours to restore the navigability of this section of the Youghiogheny River. Accordingly, during that period, no traffic will be permitted in the safety zone, as it would be unsafe for vessels attempting to transit and such transit attempts would interfere with the debris clearing operations.          Regulatory Evaluation          This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal due to the relatively short duration of vessel traffic restrictions, the relatively small size of the area regulated, and the absence of any commercial vessel transits along this section of the Youghiogheny River, due to insufficient bridge clearances and water depth downriver.          Federalism Assessment          Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

text:   SUMMARY:     This action changes the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) calculation regulations to conform to changes required by section 371 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, which specifies that costs to motor vehicle manufacturers attributable to value added in Mexico be included with the costs attributable to value added in the United States and Canada for the purpose of separating foreign and domestic fleets.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         I. Background         EPA is today promulgating changes to its fuel economy calculation regulations to conform to changes in the Motor Vehicle Information &amp; Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2), made by section 371 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993 (NAFTA Implementation Act), Public Law 103&hyph;182 (December 8, 1993).

Background         EPA is today promulgating changes to its fuel economy calculation regulations to conform to changes in the Motor Vehicle Information &amp; Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2), made by section 371 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993 (NAFTA Implementation Act), Public Law 103&hyph;182 (December 8, 1993). Section 104(a)(2) of the NAFTA Implementation Act specifically provides that ``appropriate officers of the United States Government may issue such regulations *&blank;*&blank;* as may be necessary to ensure that any *&blank;*&blank;* amendment made by this Act, that takes effect on the date the Agreement enters into force is appropriately implemented on such date.''

text: nullnull      Section 371 of the NAFTA Implementation Act simply adds a new subparagraph (G) to 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2) extending domestic treatment to costs to the manufacturer attributable to value added in Mexico, according to an explicit phase-in schedule. The statutory change does not alter the current treatment of costs to the manufacturer attributable to value added in the United States or Canada. Pursuant to clause (iii) in new subparagraph (G), the Secretary of Transportation is to prescribe reasonable procedures for manufacturers to make elections for the phase-in schedules described in today's regulations, and the EPA Administrator may prescribe rules for carrying out subparagraph (G). Today, EPA is amending its regulations governing the determination of domestic production to include the provisions of new subparagraph (G) in 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2).         II. Environmental Effects and Economic Impacts         Because the NAFTA Implementation Act does not give EPA discretion as to the content of these regulations and because Congress required the regulations to become effective less than a month after enactment of this Act, the Agency has not conducted detailed analyses of the environmental and economic impacts separate from the analyses that were done on the North American Free Trade Agreement.         III. Public Participation and Effective Date         Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Agency is not using notice and comment rulemaking procedures to promulgate this rule because the Agency has found that notice is unnecessary and impracticable. Comment is unnecessary because the rule issued today merely conforms pre-existing regulations as required by the NAFTA Implementation Act and does not involve an exercise of discretion by the Administrator. Furthermore, comment is impracticable because the NAFTA Implementation Act allowed the Administrator less than one month between the date of enactment and the date by which the regulations must be effective. It is impracticable to have notice-and-comment rulemaking completed in such a short time. This short time period is consistent with EPA's view that it is performing a ministerial act that is not subject to notice and comment rulemaking.     The rule is being made effective sooner than 30 days after publication or service. This is permitted by section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act when the Agency finds good cause and publishes it with the rule. The Agency finds that there is good cause. The regulation needs to be effective on January 1, 1994, to avoid having the statute (which goes into effect on January 1, 1994) differ from the implementing regulations. In addition, the statutory provision itself will go into effect less than 30 days after it was enacted, which precludes EPA from providing 30 days between publication or service and the effective date.     The Agency does not believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required and does not expect this change to be controversial, as it directly incorporates the explicit provisions of the statutory amendment into the current regulations. Nonetheless, EPA will accept comments on these regulatory changes and will consider making changes if justified by the comments.

Statutory Authority         Authority for the actions promulgated in this final rule is granted to EPA by section 371 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;182.         V. Administrative Designation         Under Executive Order 12866, the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:     (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;     (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;     (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or     (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.     It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.         VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act         The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1990, which requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal regulations upon small entities, does not apply to this rulemaking. Section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires analyses only for final rules for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. As discussed in section III, a general notice of rulemaking would be unnecessary and impracticable and, thus, is not required for this rule.         VII. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements         Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501     et seq.,     EPA must obtain Office of Management and Budget clearance for any activity that will involve collecting substantially the same information from ten or more non-Federal respondents. This regulation does not impose any new information requirements or contain any new information collection requirements and will result in no change in the reporting burden.

text:   SUMMARY:     This rule issues technical amendments to Medicare   regulations intended to simplify and improve our system for   evaluating the performance of fiscal intermediaries and   carriers in the administration of the Medicare program.   Currently, we evaluate intermediaries using performance   criteria and standards announced in an annual notice in the       Federal Register    . We are clarifying the methodology for   establishing these criteria and standards. For consistency,   we establish comparable regulation requirements for the   evaluation of carrier performance.       These revisions are published in accordance with   sections 1816(f) and 1842(b)(2) of the Social Security Act   which require us to develop standards, criteria, and   procedures to evaluate an intermediary's or carrier's   overall performance.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         I. Background       Under section 1816(a) of the Social Security Act (the   Act), public or private organizations and agencies   participate in the administration of Part A (Hospital   Insurance) of the Medicare program under agreements with the   Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). These   agencies or organizations are known as fiscal   intermediaries, and they perform bill processing and benefit   payment functions for the Medicare program. Under section   1842(a) of the Act, the Secretary is authorized to enter   into contracts with carriers to fulfill various functions in   the administration of Part B (Supplementary Medical   Insurance) of the Medicare program. Beneficiaries,   physicians and suppliers of the services submit claims to   these carriers that, in turn, make appropriate payments.   Beginning in 1980 for intermediaries and in 1981 for   carriers, we have been evaluating the effectiveness and   efficiency of contractor operations through a system of   criteria and standards called the Contractor Performance   Evaluation Program (CPEP).                                         42 CFR Part 421                        Medicare Program; Revisions to Criteria and Standards for   Evaluating Intermediaries and Carriers      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS.        </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.         </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This rule issues technical amendments to Medicare   regulations intended to simplify and improve our system for   evaluating the performance of fiscal intermediaries and   carriers in the administration of the Medicare program.

text: nullnull      We refer to the performance requirements we use to   evaluate the performance of intermediaries and carriers in   meeting their contractual obligations to HCFA in our   regulations and program instructions as criteria and   standards. When we developed our regulations, criteria were   expected to be distinguished from standards; we intended to   measure broad categorizations of performance using criteria   (42 CFR 421.120) and to measure statistical and performance   data using standards (&sect;421.122). As planned, a contractor   had to be evaluated by and pass the requirements of the   criteria before we evaluated contractor performance using   statistical standards. However, in practice, the standards   have been used to measure a contractor's compliance with the   requirements of the criteria. The separate reliance on   statistical standards diminished and we have developed a   CPEP under which standards are used to measure the   performance of specific activities in a defined criteria   instead of ``statistical'' standards.       II. Summary of the Proposed Rule       On December 3, 1992, we published in the     Federal   Register     (57 FR 57125) a proposed rule describing technical   revisions we proposed to make to Medicare regulations in   order to simplify and improve our system for evaluating the   performances of fiscal intermediaries and carriers in the   administration of the Medicare program. These technical   revisions are necessary to bring our regulations up to date   with our actual use of criteria and standards in performance   evaluations.   In the preamble to the proposed rule we described how   the reliance on statistical standards diminished and that   current ``standards'' are used to measure the performance of   specific activities in a defined criterion. That is,   measurement and evaluation using criteria and standards have   evolved into a one-step process. In addition, we noted that   certain functions that were included in the original planned   evaluation structure have been transferred to more   appropriate review activities. We, therefore, proposed to   amend &sect;&sect;421.3, 421.112(b), 421.118(b) and 421.122 to delete   reference to statistical standards and to replace the   general standards for the areas evaluated formerly by   statistical standards with a general explanation of the   areas evaluated by performance standards.   We also mentioned in the proposed rule that our   regulations do not contain requirements relating to   measurement of carrier performance that are parallel to   those for intermediaries. For consistency, we proposed to   establish a new &sect;421.201, ``Performance Criteria and   Standards,'' that would measure and evaluate carrier   performance of functional responsibilities, such as,   accurate and timely processing of claims, responsiveness to   beneficiaries', physicians' and suppliers' concerns, and   proper management of administrative funds.   We proposed to base performance criteria and standards   on the experience of carriers nationwide, changes in carrier   operations due to fiscal constraints, and our objectives in   achieving better performance. Before the beginning of each   CPEP evaluation period, we would publish the performance   criteria and standards as a notice in the     Federal Register    .   We also announced that we would add a new &sect;421.203,   ``Carrier's failure to perform efficiently and effectively,''   to explain the adverse action that may be taken by the   Secretary if the carrier fails to meet criteria and   standards specified at &sect;421.201. The content is parallel   to &sect;421.124, which applies to intermediaries. This new   &sect;421.203 does not add or change carrier obligations. It   merely codifies in regulations a provision specific to   carriers that has been in effect since Public Law 98&hyph;369.       III. Analysis of and Response to Public Comments       We received 10 timely items of correspondence in   response to the December 3, 1992 proposed rule. The   comments were from intermediaries, carriers, contractor   advocacy groups, and provider advocacy groups. A summary of   the comments and the Department's responses follow:       Comment:     Several commenters suggested that a process   be developed by HCFA for receiving comments, complaints, or   problems with carrier performance by physicians or   professional organizations and that the information   generated by this process be included in the overall   performance evaluation of a carrier.       Response:     Beginning in Fiscal Year 1994, HCFA will   review both intermediaries' and carriers' efforts to enhance   customer satisfaction through the use of customer   satisfaction surveys, including the National Physician   Survey. Results of the surveys will be used to establish   performance data on customer satisfaction and to identify   areas in need of improvement. The results will be   summarized for publication in the report of contractor   performance.

text: nullnull            Comment:     A number of the commenters believe that   certain of our proposed changes at &sect;&sect;421.124 and 421.203   are unnecessary. Those changes would allow the Secretary to   take adverse action if an intermediary or carrier exceeds   the amount the Secretary finds to be reasonable and adequate   to meet the costs which must be incurred by an efficiently   and economically operated intermediary or carrier,   notwithstanding whether the intermediary or carrier meets   the published criteria and standards. Both the intermediary   and carrier contracts currently have a provision to allow   the Secretary to request a committee of the contractors to   assist in efforts to effect improvements in the high cost   contractor's performance. In addition, the current   Contractor Performance Evaluation Program (CPEP) contains   measures on contractor costs. If a contractor fails to meet   the applicable criteria, its CPEP score is reduced   accordingly.             Response:     We do not agree that the proposed changes   are unnecessary. This section of the regulation would   authorize us to take adverse action for deficient   performance of a function not specifically evaluated by   CPEP. Currently, CPEP only measures contractor performance   in meeting the approved budget and the contractor's relative   standing among similar contractors. Moreover, beginning in   FY 1993, CPEP eliminated the concept of passing/failing the   overall evaluation. Passing/failing now is determined on a   standard by standard basis. For example, if a contractor   fails to meet the approved budget, it will fail one standard   in CPEP, not the entire CPEP. Thus, despite CPEP, the   authority to take adverse contract action against high cost   intermediaries and carriers is necessary. As the commenters   note, current contracts allow the Secretary to request a   committee of the contractors to assist in efforts to effect   improvements in the high cost contractor's performance. The   proposed regulatory change allows us to take the next   logical step in the event efforts to effect improvement have   failed. We will have authority to take adverse action based   on continued high cost performance.         Comment:       Several commenters stressed that the proposed   &sect;421.124 and &sect;421.203 were vague. They asked that HCFA   further define ``reasonable'' amount, and how and when high   cost would be calculated.             Response:     We believe that the provisions at &sect;421.124   and &sect;421.203 are clear and straightforward. It is our   responsibility to consider the funding levels that are   reasonable and adequate to meet the costs incurred by an   efficiently and economically operated contractor. To   address this responsibility, we develop unit cost targets   for each contractor prior to the start of every fiscal year.   These unit cost targets are forwarded to the HCFA regional   offices as part of the Budget and Performance Requirements   (BPRs) package and represent the benchmark for the   negotiations between the regional offices and the   contractors.

text: nullnull        We believe that the composition of a contractor's   workload (for example, number of hospital inpatient bills   versus number of outpatient bills or laboratory bills, etc.)   is an important factor in the amount of costs it incurs   since some claims are inherently more problematic and   difficult to resolve. In order to give full consideration   of each contractor's unique situation, we currently apply a   ``complexity index'' to develop the BPRs' unit cost targets.   This methodology allows us to correlate the contractor's   costs with its individual workload composition. The use of   the complexity index allows us to identify the contractors   whose unit costs appear to be out of proportion to the type   and medium (electronic versus hardcopy) of workload they   must process.         Use of the complexity index methodology allows us to   evaluate each contractor's costs with full consideration of   its unique workload mix and within the national forum of its   peers. In this way, we identify our high cost contractors.   However, since the use of the complexity index methodology   is an administrative tool to identify contractors with   aberrant costs and can be changed or modified as required,   we do not believe it necessary to outline this methodology   in the regulation.             Comment:     Several commenters stated that the proposed   &sect;&sect;421.124(a) and 421.203(a) on high cost contractors do not   specify the types of adverse action we may take on the   grounds of excessive cost. Contractors are uncertain about   how we would go about the process of applying sanctions and   what these sanctions might be.             Response:     Adverse contract actions are listed in   &sect;&sect;421.124(a) and 421.203(a) of the proposed regulation, but   we are not limited to those. Adverse contract actions are   further defined in the intermediary and carrier manual   issuances released within the HCFA Program Manual Issuances   System, which contain the details of the CPEP. Adverse   actions range in severity commensurate with relative   performance and include, but are not limited to, such   actions as, Regional Office Letter of Admonition; Central   Office Letter of Admonition; deletion of the automatic   renewal clause from the contract without performance goals   established; deletion of the automatic renewal clause from   the contract with performance goals established; limited   contract automatic-renewal clause and provision for   termination upon 90 days notice; reduction in territory or   ``carve-out''; non-renewal; and termination.             Comment:     A commenter was unsure whether, if HCFA does   not publish the CPEP standards during a fiscal year, there   would be no performance evaluation for that year or whether   the previous year's CPEP would apply.             Response:     In general, the evaluation period which the   criteria and standards measure is the Federal fiscal year.   We make every effort to publish the criteria and standards   prior to the beginning of the Federal fiscal year, that is,   October 1st. If we do not publish a     Federal Register     notice   before the new fiscal year begins, readers may presume that,   until and unless notified otherwise, the criteria and   standards which were previously in effect remain in effect.   When a new CPEP is published, it usually applies to a   prospective period, as stated in the     Federal Register       notice.             Comment:     One commenter states that contractors   participate in pilot projects which may involve additional   funding from HCFA. They assume this ``additional funding''   would not be considered as ``excessively high costs''.             Response:     We encourage contractors to participate in   pilot projects which may result in improved quality, service   or efficiency in the administration of the Medicare program.   Where a contractor's participation in a pilot study or   program adversely affects its performance evaluation,   appropriate adjustments are made to mitigate the impact of   the pilot study or program.

text: nullnull          Comment:     One commenter recommends that HCFA not base   criteria and standards on the sliding scale of available   funding but on true expectations of performance and   therefore delete ``changes in fiscal operations due to fiscal   constraints'' as a basis for developing criteria and   standards.       Response:     Each year the specific standards are revised   and developed in concert with the specific budget and   performance requirements, because that is the fiscally   responsible approach to develop uniform and fair performance   standards for the Medicare contractor community. We will   continue to develop standards in conjunction with budget and   performance requirements.       Comment:     One commenter notes that &sect;&sect;421.124 and   421.203 do not include the contract's provision for an   extension of the contract, subject to cost limitations.   This would deprive high cost contractors of the formal   opportunity to choose between accepting limits on their   reimbursable costs and losing their Medicare contracts.       Response:     The contract allows us to offer a high cost   contractor the option of submitting a lower budget or losing   its Medicare contract. Sections 421.124 and 421.203 would   give us the authority to determine the amount which is   reasonable and adequate to efficiently and economically   operate as an intermediary and carrier. If we determine   that we cannot afford to contract with high cost   intermediaries or carriers, we may consider appropriate   adverse contract action.       IV. Provisions of the Final Rule       Based on our review of the comments submitted, we are   making no substantive changes to the proposed revisions to   the rules affecting criteria and standards for evaluating   intermediaries and carriers as published on December 3,   1992, (57 FR 233). Only minor editorial and technical   revisions have been made to the proposed rules.

text: nullnull      42 CFR part 421 is amended as set forth below:          PART 421_INTERMEDIARIES AND CARRIERS       1. The authority citation for part 421 continues to read as   follows:              Authority:     Secs. 1102, 1815, 1816, 1833, 1834(a) and (h),   1842, 1861(u), 1871, 1874, and 1875 of the Social Security Act   (42 U.S.C. 1302, 1395g, 1395h, 1395l, 1395m(a) and (h), 1395u,   1395x(u), 1395hh, 1395kk, and 1395ll), and 42 U.S.C. 1395b-1.          2. Section 421.3 is revised to read as follows:      &sect;421.3     Definitions.           Intermediary     means an entity that has a contract with HCFA   to determine and make Medicare payments for Part A or Part B   benefits payable on a cost basis (or under the Prospective   Payment System for hospitals) and to perform other related   functions. For purposes of designating regional or alternative   regional intermediaries for home health agencies and of   designating intermediaries for hospices under &sect;421.117 as well   as for applying the performance criteria in &sect;421.120 and the   performance standards in &sect;421.122 and any adverse action   resulting from such application, the term intermediary also means   a Blue Cross Plan which has entered into a subcontract approved   by HCFA with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to   perform intermediary functions.       &sect;421.112     [Amended]       3. In &sect;421.112(b), ``statistical standards'' is revised to   read ``performance standards''.       &sect;421.118     [Amended]       4. In &sect;421.118(b) ``statistical standards'' is revised to   read ``performance standards''.   5. Section 421.122 is revised to read as follows:       &sect;421.122     Performance standards.       (a)     Development of standards.     In addition to the   performance criteria (&sect;421.120), HCFA develops detailed   performance standards for use in evaluating intermediary   performance which may be based on historical performance,   application of acceptable statistical measures of variation to   nationwide intermediary experience during a base period, or   changing program emphases or requirements. These standards are   also developed considering intermediary experience and evaluate   the specific requirements of each functional responsibility or   criterion.   (b)     Factors beyond intermediary's control.     To identify   measurable factors that significantly affect an intermediary's   performance, but that are not within the intermediary's control,   HCFA will_  (1) Study the performance of intermediaries during the base   period, and   (2) Consider the noncontrollable factors in developing   performance standards.   (c)     Publication of standards.     The development and revision   of standards for evaluating intermediary performance is a   continuing process. Therefore, before the beginning of each   evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal   fiscal year period of October 1&hyph;September 30, HCFA publishes   the performance standards as part of the     Federal Register     notice   describing the performance criteria issued under &sect;421.120(c).   HCFA may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every   year. HCFA interprets the statutory phrase ``before the beginning   of each evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the   criteria and standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as   long as the evaluation period of the intermediaries for the new   criteria and standards begins after the publication of the   notice.   6. Section 421.124 is revised to read as follows:       &sect;421.124     Intermediary's failure to perform efficiently and   effectively.       (a) Failure by an intermediary to meet, or to demonstrate   the capacity to meet, the criteria or standards specified in   &sect;&sect;421.120 and 421.122 may be grounds for adverse action by the   Secretary or by HCFA, such as reassignment of providers, offer of   a short-term agreement, termination of a contract, or non-renewal   of a contract. If an intermediary meets all criteria and   standards in its overall performance, but does not meet them with   respect to a specific provider or class of providers, HCFA may   reassign that provider or class of providers to another   intermediary in accordance with &sect;421.114.   (b) In addition, notwithstanding whether an intermediary   meets the criteria and standards, if the cost incurred by the   intermediary to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the   amount which HCFA finds to be reasonable and adequate to meet the   cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically   operated intermediary, those high costs may also be grounds for   adverse action.   7. In subpart C a new &sect;421.201 is added to read as follows:       &sect;421.201     Performance criteria and standards.       (a)     Application of performance criteria and standards.     As   part of the carrier evaluations mandated by section 1842(b)(2) of   the Act, HCFA periodically assesses the performance of carriers   in their Medicare operations using performance criteria and   standards.   (1) The criteria measure and evaluate carrier performance of   functional responsibilities such as_  (i) Accurate and timely payment determinations;   (ii) Responsiveness to beneficiary, physician, and supplier   concerns; and

text:   SUMMARY:     This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 984 for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. Authorization of this budget enables the Walnut Marketing Board (Board) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 984, both as amended (7 CFR part 984), regulating the handling of walnuts grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.         The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.     This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing order now in effect, California walnuts are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable walnuts handled during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, which began August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.     The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.     Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.     The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.     There are approximately 5,000 producers of California walnuts under this marketing order, and approximately 65 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of California walnut producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.     The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year was prepared by the Walnut Marketing Board, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Board are producers and handlers of California walnuts. They are familiar with the Board's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.     The assessment rate recommended by the Board was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected merchantable certifications of California walnuts. Because that rate will be applied to the actual quantity of certified merchantable walnuts, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Board's expenses.     The Board met September 9, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $2,170,772, $229,125 more than the previous year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Administrative salaries, $101,712 ($101,331), Board expenses, $35,000 ($32,000), office rent, $26,419 ($25,704), domestic market research and development, $953,000 ($875,000), walnut production research, $718,302 ($438,488), crop survey, $45,000 ($43,000), and crop estimate, $60,000 ($52,000). Items which have decreased compared to the amount budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: social security and hospital insurance taxes, $8,129 ($9,700), group life, retirement, and medical, $44,370 ($47,485), office salaries, $40,740 ($40,771), equipment maintenance and warranties, $10,000 ($12,000), furniture, fixtures, and automobiles, $5,000 ($20,000), and production research director, $40,000 ($91,068). The Board also eliminated funding for export market research and development and the reserve for contingencies for which $20,000 and $50,000 were recommended last year, respectively. All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts.

text: nullnull      The Board also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.0111 per kernelweight pound, $0.0021 more than the previous year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 198,000,000 kernelweight pounds of merchantable walnuts, will yield $2,197,800 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Unexpended funds may be used temporarily during the first five months of the subsequent marketing year, but must be made available to the handlers from whom collected within that period.     While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.     After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Board and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.     Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the     Federal Register     because: (1) The Board needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the marketing year began on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the marketing year apply to all assessable walnuts handled during the marketing year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Board at a public meeting and similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

text:   SUMMARY:     This interim final rule increases the quantities of ``Class 1'' (Scotch) and ``Class 3'' (Native) spearmint oil produced in the Far West that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. This rule was recommended by the Spearmint Oil Administrative Committee (Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order for spearmint oil produced in the Far West. The Committee recommended this rule to avoid extreme fluctuations in supplies and prices and thus help to maintain stability in the Far West spearmint oil market.

text: nullnull      This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing order now in effect, salable quantities and allotment percentages may be established for classes of spearmint oil produced in the Far West. This rule increases the quantities of ``Class 1'' and ``Class 3'' spearmint oil produced in the Far West that may be purchased from or handled for producers by handlers during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, which ends on May 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.     The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.     Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.     The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.     There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately 260 producers of spearmint oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 160 producers hold ``Class 1'' Scotch spearmint oil allotment base, and approximately 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native) spearmint oil allotment base. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil may be classified as small entities.     The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more than one commodity and whose income from farming operations are not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon (part of the area covered by the marketing order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area covered by the marketing order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil.     This rule increases the quantities of the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, which ends on May 31, 1995. This rule increases the Scotch spearmint oil salable quantity and allotment percentage from 723,326 pounds to 811,516 pounds and 41 percent to 46 percent, respectively, and the Native spearmint oil salable quantity and allotment percentage from 1,092,577 pounds to 1,287,680 pounds and 56 percent to 66 percent, respectively, for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year.     The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers during a marketing year. The salable quantity calculated by the Committee is based on the estimated trade demand. The total salable quantity is divided by the total industry allotment base to determine an allotment percentage. Each producer is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment percentage to the producer's allotment base for the applicable class of spearmint oil.     The initial salable quantities and allotment percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 6, 1993, meeting. The Committee recommended salable quantities of 723,326 pounds and 897,388 pounds, and allotment percentages of 41 percent and 46 percent, respectively, for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil. A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's October 6, 1993, recommendation was published in the December 21, 1993, issue of the     Federal Register     [58 FR 67378]. Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 20, 1994. No comments were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year was published in the March 16, 1994, issue of the     Federal Register     [59 FR 12151].

text: nullnull      At its June 14, 1994, teleconference meeting, the Committee unanimously recommended that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year be increased. The Committee recommended that the Native spearmint oil salable quantity be increased from 897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds, and that the allotment percentage, based on a revised total allotment base of 1,951,032 pounds, be increased from 46 to 56 percent resulting in a 195,189 pound increase in the salable quantity.     An interim final rule incorporating the Committee's June 14, 1994, recommendation was published in the August 26, 1994,     Federal Register     (59 FR 44028). Comments on the interim rule were solicited from interested persons until September 26, 1994. No comments were received.     Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the marketing order, at its October 5, 1994, meeting, the Committee recommended by a unanimous vote to increase the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Scotch spearmint oil. The committee also recommended by 10 to 1 vote an increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil. The person voting in opposition favored a smaller increase in the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil.     Specifically, the committee recommended that the salable quantities and allotment percentages for Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year be increased from 723,326 pounds to 811,516 pounds, and 1,092,577 pounds to 1,287,680 pounds, respectively. Based on a revised total allotment base of 1,763,795 pounds, the allotment percentage for Scotch spearmint oil is increased from 41 percent to 46 percent, resulting in an 88,190 pound increase in the salable quantity. Further, based on the same revised total allotment base published in the August 26, 1994,     Federal Register     (59 FR 44028) the allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil is increased from 56 percent to 66 percent, resulting in a 195,103 pound increase in the salable quantity.        <TABLE>           Scotch Spearmint Oil Recommendations       1&blank;   1Oct. 6, 1993   1Oct. 5, 1994          (1) Salable Quantity   723,326   811,516     (2) Total Allotment Base   1,764,209   1,763,795     (3) Allotment Percentage   41   46   </TABLE>      <TABLE>       Native Spearmint Oil Recommendations     1&blank;   1Oct. 6, 1993   1June 14, 1994   1Oct. 5, 1994          (1) Salable Quantity   897,388   1,092,577   1,287,680     (2) Total Allotment Base   1,950,843   1,951,032   1,951,032     (3) Allotment Percentage   46   56   66   </TABLE>          In making this recommendation the Committee considered all available information on supply and demand. As of October 5, 1994, the Committee reports that of the respective 1994&hyph;95 Scotch and Native spearmint oil salable quantities of 723,326 pounds and 1,092,577 pounds, and approximately 116,000 pounds and 87,000 pounds, respectively, remained available for handling. Handlers have indicated, however, that demand may approximate 200,000 pounds of Scotch spearmint oil, and 300,000 pounds of Native spearmint oil for the remainder of this marketing year. This level of demand was not anticipated by the Committee when it made its initial recommendation for the establishment of the Scotch and Native spearmint oil salable quantities and allotment percentages for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, nor was it foreseen when the Committee made its June 14, 1994, recommendation for an increase in the Native spearmint oil salable quantity and allotment percentage.

text: nullnull      The recommended salable quantity of 811,516 pounds of Scotch spearmint oil (an increase of 88,190 pounds), combined with the actual June 1, 1994, carry-in of 145,809 pounds, results in a revised 1994&hyph;95 available supply of 957,325 pounds. Similarly, the recommended salable quantity of 1,287,680 pounds of Native spearmint oil (an increase of 195,103 pounds), combined with the revised June 1, 1994, carry-in of 19,139 pounds, results in a revised 1994&hyph;95 available supply of 1,306,819 pounds. The revised available supplies of the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil, respectively, are approximately 67,000 pounds and 227,000 pounds higher than the respective annual average of sales for the past five years. The Committee anticipates that foreseeable demand for both classes of oil will be adequately met with the recommended increase.     The Department, based on its analysis of available information, has determined that allotment percentages of 46 percent and 66 percent, respectively, should be established for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. These percentages will provide an increased salable quantity of 811,516 pounds of Scotch spearmint oil and an increased salable quantity of 1,287,680 pounds of Native spearmint oil.     Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.     After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including that contained in the prior proposed, final, and interim final rules in connection with the establishment of the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year, the Committee's recommendation and other available information, it is found that to revise &sect;985.213 to change the salable quantities and allotment percentages for the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.     Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register     because: (1) This interim final rule increases the quantities of the Scotch and Native classes of spearmint oil that may be marketed immediately; (2) the committee recommended this rule a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportuntnity to provide input; and (3) This rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

text:   SUMMARY:     This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 989 for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. Authorization of this budget enables the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 (7 CFR part 989), regulating the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.           The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.       This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing order now in effect, California raisins are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable raisins handled during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which began August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.       The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.     Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.       The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.       There are approximately 5,000 producers of California raisins under this marketing order, and approximately 20 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of California raisin producers and a minority of handlers may be classified as small entities.       The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of California raisins. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.       The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected acquisitions of California raisins. Because that rate will be applied to actual acquisitions, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.       The Committee, with headquarters in Fresno, California, met August 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $1,324,000, which is $744,940 more than the previous year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Office salaries, $123,000 ($90,000), fieldman salaries, $44,000 ($42,600), Payroll taxes, $30,000 ($27,500), employer retirement contribution, $20,000 ($18,200), general insurance, $8,000 ($6,000), group medical insurance, $40,000 ($37,000), rent, $43,000 ($17,900), telephone, $15,000 ($4,000), postage, $20,000 ($12,000), office supplies, $30,000 ($20,000), repairs and maintenance, $10,000 ($5,000), audit fees, $20,000 ($3,600), office travel, $14,000 ($12,000), Committee meeting expenses, $7,500 ($5,000), miscellaneous expense, $15,000 ($10,000), objective measurement survey, $14,750 ($14,000), and reserve for contingencies, $142,400 ($55,810). The Committee also recommended employee benefit expenses of $2,500 and export program funding of $50,000 for travel and $350,000 for foreign program administration, for which no funding was recommended last year.                     7 CFR Part 989                Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Expenses and Assessment Rate      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.       </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Interim final rule with request for comments.         </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 989 for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year.

Because that rate will be applied to actual acquisitions, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.       The Committee, with headquarters in Fresno, California, met August 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $1,324,000, which is $744,940 more than the previous year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Office salaries, $123,000 ($90,000), fieldman salaries, $44,000 ($42,600), Payroll taxes, $30,000 ($27,500), employer retirement contribution, $20,000 ($18,200), general insurance, $8,000 ($6,000), group medical insurance, $40,000 ($37,000), rent, $43,000 ($17,900), telephone, $15,000 ($4,000), postage, $20,000 ($12,000), office supplies, $30,000 ($20,000), repairs and maintenance, $10,000 ($5,000), audit fees, $20,000 ($3,600), office travel, $14,000 ($12,000), Committee meeting expenses, $7,500 ($5,000), miscellaneous expense, $15,000 ($10,000), objective measurement survey, $14,750 ($14,000), and reserve for contingencies, $142,400 ($55,810). The Committee also recommended employee benefit expenses of $2,500 and export program funding of $50,000 for travel and $350,000 for foreign program administration, for which no funding was recommended last year.         </SUPPLEM>

Pool expenses are deducted from proceeds obtained from the sale of reserve raisins. These proposed expenses are $766,150 more than the $886,600 for 1993&hyph;94 reserve pool expenses.   The larger administrative and reserve pool expenses result from the Committee's takeover of certain industry export marketing activities and the fact that the Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisin crop is expected to be significantly larger than last year. This large crop, and the pooling of Zante Currant raisins for the first time in many years, will result in a larger quantity to be pooled and increased costs. Reserve pool expenditures are reviewed annually by the Department.   A California State raisin marketing order was terminated earlier this year. Its administrative agency, the California Raisin Advisory Board (CALRAB), formerly conducted marketing promotion and paid advertising activities here and abroad for the California raisin industry.   The Committee is taking over the funding and administration of the Market Promotion Program (MPP). The MPP, administered by the Department's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), encourages the development, maintenance, and expansion of export markets for agricultural commodities like raisins.   Recently, the FAS redirected MPP funds allocated to CALRAB for foreign promotion and advertising to the Committee which desires to use the funds to continue the industry's strong overseas promotion and advertising activities. To receive the full allocation ($4,479,549), the Committee must be able to show that it plans to spend, from industry sources, an amount equal to 50 percent of that allotment ($2,239,975). This spending can be for administration or promotion. The Committee recommended that the increased spending necessary to meet the required MPP matching figure be funded through increased handler assessments, reserve pool funds, and merchandising incentive program funds.   Under the marketing order's volume regulation provisions, marketing percentages (free and reserve) for a varietal type can be implemented to stabilize supplies. The free percentage prescribes the portion of the crop that can be shipped immediately to any market. The reserve percentage prescribes the portion of the crop to be held for later shipment. Reserve raisins are held in a reserve pool by handlers for the account of the Committee. Funds generated from the sales of reserve raisins, after deduction of reserve pool expenses, are distributed equally to equity holders in the pool (producers).

For various countries, cash rebates and advertising/promotion incentives are offered to qualifying importers. Funds used to pay the incentives are derived from reserve pool sales.   The Committee's MPP match of $2,239,775 will be made up of $1,249,775 in Committee domestic and overseas administration costs and $990,000 in industry market promotion funds. Domestic administration costs include $283,560 in employee salaries and benefits and $252,215 for MPP overhead costs. The overhead costs include expenditures for Committee staff to travel overseas ($100,000), Committee delegation trips ($50,000), rent ($28,500), insurance ($1,600), telephone ($7,500), postage ($6,000), office supplies, ($2,500), repairs and maintenance ($2,000), audit fees ($15,000), local travel ($3,000), equipment ($5,000), and miscellaneous expenses ($31,715).   The overseas costs of $714,000 include funding for the Committee's overseas marketing representatives and their staffs for nine countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, China, and Hong Kong). The costs include salaries and benefits, travel, office rent, office supplies, utilities, and postage. The representatives will handle the administration and day-to-day details of the marketing activities conducted in these countries.   The domestic and overseas administrative and overhead costs for the MPP will be paid with handler administrative assessments and reserve pool proceeds. Most of the major expense items for the MPP (employees salaries and benefits, domestic and overseas travel, and office rent) will be shared equally between administrative and reserve pool funds.   A total of $1,442,325 is presently available for the Committee's merchandising incentive program. Of that amount, a total of $990,000 will qualify for the MPP match. The Committee plans to use these funds for authorized promotion activities in Japan.   The Committee unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $4.00 per ton, which is $2.20 more than last year. This rate, when applied to anticipated acquisitions of 331,000 tons, will yield $1,324,000 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover anticipated administrative expenses. Any unexpended assessment funds from the crop year are required to be credited or refunded to the handlers from whom collected.   While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers and producers, the costs on handlers are in the form of uniform assessments, and those on producers will be shared equally by all equity holders in the 1994&hyph;95 reserve pool for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.   After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.   Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the     Federal Register     because:   (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;   (2) the crop year began on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the crop year apply to all assessable raisins handled during the crop year;   (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and it is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and   (4) this interim final rule provides a 60-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.

The List of Foreign Margin Stocks (Foreign List) is composed of foreign equity securities that have met the Board's eligibility criteria under Regulation T. The OTC List and the Foreign List are published four times a year by the Board. This document sets forth additions to and deletions from the previous OTC List and Foreign List.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Listed below are additions to and deletions from the OTC List, which was last published on July 25, 1994 (59 FR 37651), and became effective August 8, 1994. A copy of the complete OTC List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks.       The OTC List includes those stocks that meet the criteria in Regulations G, T and U (12 CFR parts 207, 220 and 221, respectively). This determination also affects the applicability of Regulation X (12 CFR part 224). These stocks have the degree of national investor interest, the depth and breadth of market, and the availability of information respecting the stock and its issuer to warrant regulation in the same fashion as exchange-traded securities. The OTC List also includes any OTC stock designated for trading in the national market system (NMS security) under a rule approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additional OTC stocks may be designated as NMS securities in the interim between the Board's quarterly publications. They will become automatically marginable upon the effective date of their NMS designation. The names of these stocks are available at the SEC and at the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and will be incorporated into the Board's next quarterly publication of the OTC List.   Also listed below are additions to and deletions from the Board's Foreign List, which was last published on July 25, 1994 (59 FR 37651), and became effective August 8, 1994.

No additional useful information would be gained by public participation. The full requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to deferred effective date have not been followed in connection with the issuance of this amendment because the Board finds that it is in the public interest to facilitate investment and credit decisions based in whole or in part upon the composition of these Lists as soon as possible.

text:   summary:     This action removes Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 68, which prohibits flight operations within the territory and airspace of Yemen by any United States air carrier and commercial operator, by any person exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, or by an operator using an aircraft registered in the United States unless the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier. This action is taken in response to the end of the civil war in Yemen, which has reduced the threat of hostile actions against persons and aircraft engaged in flight operations in Yemen.           supplementary information:     On May 18, 1994, the FAA published a final rule (59 FR 25284) prohibiting certain aircraft operations within the territory and airspace of Yemen. In the exercise of its statutory responsibility for the safety of U.S.-registered aircraft and U.S. operators, the FAA determined that the civil war in Yemen justified the imposition of certain measures to ensure the safety of U.S.-registered aircraft and operators conducting flight operations in the vicinity of Yemen's territory and airspace. SFAR 68 prohibits flight operations within the territory and airspace of Yemen by any United States air carrier and commercial operator, by any person exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, or by an operator using an aircraft registered in the United States unless the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier.        The civil war in Yemen ended on July 7, 1994. With the end of the war has come a corresponding reduction in the threat to civil aircraft operating in the territory and airspace of Yemen. There now appears to be no continuing specific threat to civil aviation arising out of, or related to, the civil war and its end.    The FAA has been advised by Yemen's civil aviation authorities that its international airports are open and operating normally. The FAA, however, has no specific information on the facilities or level of services available at individual airports in Yemen. Yemen reports that it expects to issue a new Aeronautical Information Publication by the end of 1994. Information concerning the civil aviation system in Yemen is available from the Director of the Aeronautical Information Service, Sana'a International Airport, Post Office Box 1438, Sana'a Republic of Yemen. Telephone: 011&hyph;967&hyph;1&hyph;250820. Telex: 2434. Commercial Telegraph: CIVILAIR SANA'A.    On the basis of the foregoing information, I have determined that the immediate removal of SFAR 68 from 14 CFR part 91 is appropriate. The Department of State has been advised of, and has no objection to, the action taken herein.        List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 91        Air traffic control, Aircraft, Airmen, Airports, Aviation safety, Freight, Yemen.        The Amendment        For the reasons set forth above, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 91 by removing SFAR 68 as follows:        PART 91_GENERAL OPERATING AND FLIGHT RULES        1. The authority citation for part 91 continues to read as follows:               Authority:     49 U.S.C. app. 1301(7), 1303, 1344, 1348, 1352 through 1355, 1401, 1421 through 1431, 1471, 1472, 1502, 1510, 1522, and 2121 through 2125; Articles 12, 29, 31, and 32(a) of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (61 Stat. 1180); 42 U.S.C. 4321     et seq.,     E.O. 11514, 35 FR 4247, 3 CFR, 1966&hyph;1970 Comp., p. 902; 49 U.S.C. 106(g).             2.

There now appears to be no continuing specific threat to civil aviation arising out of, or related to, the civil war and its end.    The FAA has been advised by Yemen's civil aviation authorities that its international airports are open and operating normally. The FAA, however, has no specific information on the facilities or level of services available at individual airports in Yemen. Yemen reports that it expects to issue a new Aeronautical Information Publication by the end of 1994. Information concerning the civil aviation system in Yemen is available from the Director of the Aeronautical Information Service, Sana'a International Airport, Post Office Box 1438, Sana'a Republic of Yemen. Telephone: 011&hyph;967&hyph;1&hyph;250820. Telex: 2434. Commercial Telegraph: CIVILAIR SANA'A.    On the basis of the foregoing information, I have determined that the immediate removal of SFAR 68 from 14 CFR part 91 is appropriate. The Department of State has been advised of, and has no objection to, the action taken herein.

text:   SUMMARY:     NASA is amending 14 CFR Part 1215, ``Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS),'' by revising Appendix A to reflect the estimated service rates in 1995 dollars for TDRSS standard services, based on NASA escalation estimates. 14 CFR Part 1215 sets forth the policy governing the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) services provided to non-U.S. Government users and the reimbursement for rendering such services. The TDRSS represents a major investment by the U.S. Government with the primary goal of providing improved communications and tracking services to spacecraft in low earth orbit or to mobile terrestrial users such as aircraft or balloons.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This regulation was first published in the     Federal Register     on March 9, 1983 (48 FR 9845). Each year since that time, 14 CFR Part 1215 has been amended by revising Appendix A to reflect the rate changes for the appropriate calendar years (CY). Since this revision of Appendix A to 14 CFR Part 1215 reflects the rate changes for CY 1995 and involves NASA management procedures and decisions, no public comment is required.        The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has determined that this rule is not subject to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, since it will not exert a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291.

text:   SUMMARY:     EPA is approving revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), which will be fully implemented by November 15, 1994. This implementation plan was submitted by the State on November 13, 1992, to satisfy the federal mandate to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA).           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Implementation of the CAA will require small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order for areas to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee the small business assistance program and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA and the EPA guidance document Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The plan must also determine the eligibility of small business stationary sources for assistance in the PROGRAM. The plan includes the duties, funding and schedule of implementation for the three PROGRAM components.         Section 507(a) and (e) of the CAA set forth requirements the State must meet to have an approvable PROGRAM. The State of Alabama has addressed these requirements and established a PROGRAM as described below.         1. Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP)         Alabama has established a mechanism to implement the following six requirements set forth in section 507 of title V of the CAA:           A. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further comply with the CAA;     B. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning   alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution;     C. The development of a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assist small businesses in determining applicable permit requirements under the CAA in a timely and efficient manner;                         <USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</USDEPT>       40 CFR Part 52                    Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans Alabama: Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program        <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).         </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Direct final rule.          </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     EPA is approving revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), which will be fully implemented by November 15, 1994.

The development of adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the CAA;     E. The development of adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors, or at the option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA; and     F. The development of procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source.            The State of Alabama Department of Environmental Management has indicated the Chief of the Non-Industrial Section in the Engineering Branch of the Air Division will be designated the coordinator of the Technical and Environmental Assistance Group (TEAG). The coordinator will direct and coordinate the activities of a group of at least six individuals with experience in permitting, source sampling, dispersion modeling, and public information. ADEM will support the TEAG with additional personnel as warranted. The TEAG will establish a clearinghouse of relevant technical and regulatory literature to disseminate to the small business community. It will provide information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources to operators and owners through interaction and cooperation with the Alabama Development Office (ADO), the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA), Alabama Small Business Development Consortium, Safe-State, the Waste Reduction and Technology Transfer (WRATT) program, trade associations, and other appropriate groups.     The TEAG will provide information concerning pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention programs. This shall include providing information about alternative technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that reduce air pollution. The TEAG will support the activities of the Ombudsman and answer questions from that office, other state and local agencies, trade associations, and other appropriate groups concerning air permit requirements and applicability in a timely and efficient manner. Public notices will be posted in the State's four largest newspapers of proposed and/or final rules, regulations or standards issued under the CAA. Personnel from the TEAG will speak at forums and/or meetings concerning applicable proposed or final rules, regulations or standards issued under the CAA. The TEAG will serve as the secretariat to the Ombudsman and the Compliance Advisory Panel in the development and dissemination of reports, advisory opinions and other information.     The TEAG will inform small businesses of the procedures for the Department to consider requests for a variance from a rule, work practice, standard or compliance date. The WRATT will be included in the Assistance Group where multi-media pollution prevention opportunity information is requested. Public service announcements, seminars and workshops will be developed and utilized. The TEAG will use EPA services such as the Control Technology Center (CTC) and the Emission Measurement Technical Information Center (EMTIC). Compliance Assistance to small businesses will be provided to aid them to identify applicable requirements and procedures to obtain permits in a timely fashion. The TEAG has developed and continues to work on responsive techniques, outreach techniques and information packets. This will cover topics such as pollution prevention, accidental release prevention and detection, source rights and obligations, and how to obtain approval for modification of work practices, compliance methods or schedules of compliance.     The Department will perform on-site audits at the request of small businesses to evaluate work practices, compliance monitoring procedures and recordkeeping procedures. Such audits may be performed by Department personnel or by the WRATT program at no cost to the small businesses.         2. Ombudsman         Section 507(a)(3) of the CAA requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary sources. Alabama has appointed a Small Business Ombudsman and established the office of Alabama Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses as they come under the regulation of the CAA and the oversight of the Small Business Technical and Environmental Assistance Group. The Ombudsman reports directly to the Director of the Department of Environmental Management. The Alabama Ombusman operates a toll-free hotline to provide free confidential help to small businesses on specific source problems and grievances. The Ombudsman is authorized to communicate directly with the Governor's Office, the Director of ADEM, the Chief of the Air Division, other state agencies and other government officials. The Ombudsman may propose legislation or administrative action through ADEM or the Compliance Advisory Panel.            3. Compliance Advisory Panel         Section 507(e) of the CAA requires the state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. Alabama established a seven member CAP with a membership consistent with the aforementioned CAA requirements. The makeup of the CAP is prescribed as required by the CAA and administrative support will be provided by the Department to fulfill all the responsibilities under the CAA.     The duties of the CAP include: rendering advisory opinions regarding the effectiveness of the Small Business Technical and Environmental Assistance Group; reviewing information for small business stationary air pollution sources to assure such information is understandable by the layperson; and to make periodic reports to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the Equal Access to Justice Act.

text: nullnull      4. Source Eligibility         Alabama has incorporated section 507(c)(1) and defined a Small Business Stationary Source as a source that:            (1) Operates in Alabama;     (2) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals;     (3) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act;     (4) Is not a major stationary source as defined in Titles I and III of the CAA which means the potential to emit for the source is less than:     a. 100 tons per year (tpy) of any criteria air pollutant;     b. 10 tpy of any toxic pollutant; or     c. 25 tpy of all toxic pollutants;     (5) Does not emit 50 tpy or more of any regulated pollutant; and     (6) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants.            Alabama has established the following mechanisms as required by section 507: (1) A process for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA; (2) A process for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA, but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants; and (3) A process for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the Department determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the CAA.         Final Action        In this action, EPA is approving the PROGRAM SIP revision submitted by the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective on December 30, 1994. However, if notice is received by November 30, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent notices will be published before the effective date. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period.     Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 30, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)).     This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the     Federal Register     on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request   continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

text: nullnull      Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.   Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600     et. seq.    , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,   and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.   SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such   grounds.     Union Electric Co.     v.

These revisions extend the New Source Review (NSR) regulations to new nonattainment areas for O    3     and carbon monoxide (CO).            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On May 15, 1991, and January 7, 1994, the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources, submitted revisions to the North Carolina State Implementation Plan (SIP). These revisions addressed New Source Review (NSR), Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). The RACT revisions will be addressed in a separate notice. Revision to rule 15 A NCAC 2D .0531, submitted May 15, 1991, is being approved in this notice. The remaining revisions submitted May 15, 1991, will be addressed in a separate notice. A brief description of each revision being addressed in this notice follows.             15A NCAC 2D .0531 Sources in Nonattainment Areas             North Carolina amended this rule to extend the NSR requirements to new nonattainment areas for O    3     and CO. The amendments require offsets to be obtained for both VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NO    X    ) in ozone nonattainment areas. The amendments also require that major new sources of the nonattainment pollutant locating in a nonattainment area to obtain offsets for the major new source and associated minor sources using a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 for VOC and NO    X     sources on ozone nonattainment areas and greater than one to one for CO nonattainment areas. This rule is also amended to add new compounds to the list of compounds whose emissions are exempt under this rule. This rule meets the requirement of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 for new sources locating in nonattainment areas.                   40 CFR Part 52                 Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans in North Carolina: Approval of Revisions to the North Carolina State Implementation Plan        <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).          </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Direct final rule.           </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     On May 15, 1991, and January 7, 1994, the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources, submitted revisions to the North Carolina State Implementation Plan (SIP).

text: nullnull      15A NCAC 2D .0532 Sources Contributing to an Ambient Violation         North Carolina amended this rule to exclude the nonattainment areas subject to NSR.         Final Action         EPA is approving the above referenced revisions to the North Carolina SIP. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the EPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this     Federal Register     publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective on December 30, 1994 unless, by November 30, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.     If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such   comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on December 30, 1994.    Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 30, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).)     The OMB has exempted these actions from review under Executive Order 12866.     Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.     Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600     et seq.    , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.     SIP approvals under 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.     Union Electric Co.     v.

text: null  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         I. Background         States containing CO nonattainment areas with design values of 12.7 ppm or less were required to submit, among other things, contingency measures to satisfy the provisions under section 172(c)(9). These provisions require contingency measures to be implemented in the event that an area fails to reach attainment by the applicable attainment date, December 31, 1995. Contingency measures were due by November 15, 1993, as set by EPA under section 172(b) of the Act.     Contingency measures must be implemented within 12 months after the finding of failure to attain the CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Once triggered they must take effect without further action by the state or EPA, therefore, all contingency measures must be adopted and enforceable prior to submittal to EPA.     The CAAA do not specify how many contingency measures are needed or the magnitude of emission reductions they must provide if an area fails to attain the CO NAAQS. The EPA believes that one appropriate choice of contingency measures would be to provide for the implementation of sufficient vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions or emissions reductions to counteract the effect of one year's growth in VMT while the state revises its SIP to incorporate all of the new requirements of a serious CO area.         II. This Action         In this action, EPA is approving Washington's SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993 for Vancouver, Washington because it meets the applicable requirements of the Act.     The state of Washington held public hearings in Vancouver, Washington on November 9, 1993 to entertain public comment on the CO contingency measure SIP revision. Following the public hearing the plan was adopted by the Department of Ecology on November 15, 1993 and signed by the Governor's designee on November 15, 1993, becoming effective on December 15, 1993. Ecology submitted the plan to EPA on November 15, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP.     The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria delineated at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete on April 13, 1994 and a letter dated May 6, 1994 was forwarded to the Director indicating the completeness of the submittal.         A. Analysis of State Submission         Washington's CO contingency plan for Vancouver calls for the early implementation of improvements to Washington State's basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. These improvements are part of Vancouver's inspection and maintenance program that began on June 1, 1993. While these technical enhancements are already being implemented, their use as a contingency measure is consistent with EPA guidance. The early implementation of the ``improved'' vehicle inspection and maintenance program helps to ensure that the area will attain the NAAQS. Ecology anticipates that improvements to the basic I/M program in Vancouver will reduce 1996 motor vehicle carbon monoxide emissions by an additional four percent when compared to the EPA program.     Washington's improved I/M program consists of the following elements: a loaded steady state test for light duty gasoline vehicles, two-speed test for heavy duty gas vehicles, and opacity check for diesels; biennial testing of all gasoline vehicles; tampering checks for 1981 and newer vehicles; a stringency rate of 28% for pre-1981 vehicles, a waiver rate of 15% of failed vehicles, a compliance rate of 90%. EPA's basic I/M program consists of the following elements: idle testing of 1968 and newer vehicles; annual testing of light duty gasoline vehicles; no tampering checks; a stringency rate of 20% for pre-1981 vehicles; no waiver rate; and a compliance rate of 100%.         III. Administrative Review         Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600     et seq.    , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this     Federal Register     publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective on December 30, 1994 unless, by November 30, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.     If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on December 30, 1994.     The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements.     Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.     This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the     Federal Register     on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.

text:   SUMMARY:     On July 8, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published direct final rulemaking approving the redesignation of St. Joseph, Elkhart, Marion, and Vanderburgh Counties, Indiana to attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and their accompanying maintenance plans as State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions. On the same day (July 8, 1994), a proposed rule was also published which established a 30-day public comment period noting that, if adverse comments were received regarding the direct final rule, the USEPA would withdraw the direct final rule and publish an additional final rule to address the public comments. Adverse comments were received during the public comment period and the USEPA published a withdrawal of the direct final rule on August 26, 1994. This final rule summarizes these comments and USEPA's responses and finalizes the approval of the redesignation of St. Joseph, Elkhart and Marion Counties. However, due to preliminary, non-quality industrial assured ozone data recently received from the State of Indiana for Warrick County, (which is adjacent to Vanderburgh County) indicating that a violation of the ozone standard may have occurred in 1994, USEPA is not finalizing the approval of the redesignation of Vanderburgh County at this time. The USEPA will address the Vanderburgh County redesignation request when an evaluation of these monitoring data are available.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           I. Background Information         The redesignation requests and maintenance plans discussed in this rule were submitted by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) for the following ozone nonattainment areas: South Bend/Elkhart (St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties, submitted on September 22, 1993); and Indianapolis (Marion County, submitted on November 12, 1993). On July 8, 1994, (59 FR 35044) USEPA published a direct final rule approving the redesignation requests and maintenance plans as revisions to the Indiana ozone SIP. On the same day, USEPA published a proposed rule noting that if adverse comments were received regarding the direct final rule, the USEPA would withdraw the direct final rule and publish another final rule addressing the public comments (For further information refer to 59 FR 35044 and 59 FR 36731). Adverse comments were received regarding the direct final rule and USEPA, therefore, withdrew the direct final rule on August 26, 1994, (59 FR 44040). The final rule contained in today's     Federal Register     addresses the comments which were received during the public comment period and announces USEPA's final action regarding the redesignation of St. Joseph, Elkhart and Marion Counties. The State of Indiana has provided the USEPA with preliminary, non-quality assured ozone data for Warrick County (which is adjacent to Vanderburgh County) indicating that a violation of the ozone standard may have occurred in 1994. During four days in 1994, June 18 through June 21, ozone standard exceedances may have been recorded at an Alcoa operated facility site (AIRS site 18&hyph;173&hyph;0002). The USEPA will defer final rulemaking on the redesignation of Vanderburgh County until an evaluation of these monitoring data are available for this period. Based on evaluation of these data, the redesignation of Vanderburgh County to attainment will have to be reconsidered. USEPA will summarize and respond to the adverse comments received regarding the Vanderburgh County redesignation in a subsequent final rulemaking action.         II. Public Comments and USEPA Responses         The following discussion summarizes and responds to the comments received regarding the redesignation of St. Joseph, Elkhart, and Marion Counties.         Comment         A commenter notes that, in reviewing Indiana's ozone redesignation request, the USEPA should consider the transport of ozone and ozone precursors into nonattainment areas currently part of the Lake Michigan Ozone Control Program (LMOP) (also referred to as the Lake Michigan Ozone Study [LMOS] area). Given the ongoing concerns about the control of transported ozone and ozone precursors as part of the attainment strategies being considered for the LMOP area, the commenter believes the Indiana ozone nonattainment areas (as   well as those of Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin) should not be redesignated to attainment until the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO) has conducted and completed an analysis of the ozone impacts of controlling transported ozone precursors.         USEPA Response         Although the 1991 field study conducted for LMOS produced high ozone concentrations aloft near the upwind edge of the LMOS modeling domain, implying transport of relatively high ozone concentrations into the LMOS domain, the 1991 field study did not establish the source(s) of the transported ozone. No studies have been conducted demonstrating that the Indiana nonattainment areas are the source areas responsible for the transported ozone. As there is currently no conclusive evidence that these Indiana areas are responsible for the transported ozone, USEPA does not believe that it would be appropriate to continue the nonattainment classification of these areas. USEPA further notes that these areas remain subject to obligations under sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 110(a)(2)(D) of the Clean Air Act (Act) to deal with ozone transport even after redesignation to attainment.     It should be noted that the LADCO States are conducting modeling analyses which will allow an assessment of the ozone impacts of controlling emissions in attainment areas as well as in ozone nonattainment areas. In addition, the USEPA is considering analyzing the impacts of some national controls covering both attainment areas and nonattainment areas through the use of the Regional Oxidant Model, which can cover a larger domain than the Urban Airshed Model used in LMOS and LMOP. The results of these modeling analyses may lead to new emission control requirements for attainment areas.       Comment       A commenter notes that the State of Indiana has not fully predicted the impact of future transportation projects and their effects on Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) and mobile source emissions growth. Specifically, the State of Indiana is planning to build a new four-lane highway between Marion and Vanderburgh Counties. In addition, the City of Indianapolis has recently proposed changes to its public transportation system, including the elimination of routes. Conformity analyses have not been performed for either of these proposals. The commenter argues that the September 4, 1992 redesignation guidance from USEPA's Director of the Air Quality Management Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, requires that the State prove that its State Implementation Plan (SIP) provisions are consistent with the Act's section 176(c)(4) conformity requirements.                     40 CFR Parts 52 and 81               Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and Designation of   Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; State of Indiana      <AGENCY>  AGENCY:     Environmental Protection Agency.        </AGENCY> <ACTION>  ACTION:     Final rule.         </ACTION> <SUMMARY>  SUMMARY:     On July 8, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published direct final rulemaking approving the redesignation of St. Joseph, Elkhart, Marion, and Vanderburgh Counties, Indiana to attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and their accompanying maintenance plans as State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions.

text: nullnull      USEPA Response         The USEPA conformity rule (58 FR 62218) requires the States to conduct conformity analyses for both nonattainment areas and attainment areas subject to maintenance plans. The State is currently drafting its conformity rule to comply with USEPA's conformity rule. Therefore, any major federally funded and State funded projects in the areas redesignated to attainment by this action will be addressed through State conformity analyses and will be subject to the emissions budget established by the applicable maintenance plan. The Indianapolis-Evansville highway and any major modifications in public transportation will be subject to conformity analyses after Marion County is redesignated to attainment. If the changes to the public transportation system are minor, they are not required to be subject to conformity analyses.         Comment         A commenter has noted that the State has not shown that the improvements in air quality (occurring after the violation period of 1987 through 1989) are due to permanent and enforceable emission reductions as required in section 107(d)(3)(E)(iii) of the Act. The commenter argues that the September 4, 1992 USEPA redesignation policy guidance is clear in requiring analysis of whether the improved air quality has resulted in part from either unique meteorological conditions or adverse economic conditions. Air quality improvements due to these air quality impacts are not permanent, and, therefore, are not creditable. These aspects have been neglected in both the State redesignation request and in USEPA's subsequent rulemaking.         USEPA Response         The September 4, 1992 USEPA policy guidance referred to by the commenter states that ``[a]ttainment resulting from temporary reductions in emission rates (e.g., reduced production or shutdown due to temporary adverse economic conditions) or unusually favorable meteorology would not qualify as an air quality improvement due to permanent and enforceable emission reductions.'' Neither the State nor the USEPA has neglected these issues in preparing and analyzing Indiana's redesignation request. Rather, the USEPA believes that the State has adequately demonstrated that the improvement in air quality resulting in the attainment of the ozone standard is not due to temporary economic downturn or unusually favorable meteorology. As explained below, the State has made an adequate demonstration that the improvement in air quality in these Counties leading to attainment of the ozone standard was not due to temporary reductions in emission rates or to unusually favorable meteorology.             With respect to the issue of temporary emission reductions due to economic downturn, the USEPA noted in the July 8, 1994 direct final rulemaking (59 FR 35048), that the State has shown that attainment of the ozone standard is attributable to permanent and enforceable emission reductions that have occurred in Elkhart, Marion, and St. Joseph Counties. These emission reductions have resulted from source closures, implementation of emission controls on stationary sources (this included added emission reductions resulting from the correction of reasonably available control technology regulations in response to regulation deficiencies previously noted by the USEPA), implementation of the federal motor vehicle emission control program, and implementation of gasoline reid vapor pressure restrictions (Indiana implemented USEPA reid vapor pressure requirements, lowering reid vapor pressure limits to 9.0 pounds per square inch by 1992). All of these controls are permanent and enforceable. In the case of source closures, the source permits associated with these sources have been terminated and will not be reissued. Substantial emission reductions have occurred as a result of the imposition of permanent and enforceable emission controls, and it is USEPA's judgment that these reductions, rather than reductions attributable to any temporary economic downturn, are primarily responsible for the improvement in air quality that led to the attainment of the ozone standard in these Counties. The continued attainment status of these Counties in the years since the 1990&hyph;1992 period further indicates that temporary adverse economic conditions in the 1990&hyph;1991 period were not a significant factor in the attainment of the ozone standard in these Counties.

text: nullnull      With respect to the issue of unusual meteorology, the State has compared the average meteorological parameters of maximum daily temperatures, daily mean wind speeds, percents of possible sunshine, and percents of relative humidity for the periods of May through August, 1990 through 1992, with the 30-year (1961&hyph;1990) norms for these parameters. In all three areas considered for redesignation, the 1990&hyph;1992 averages for these parameters agreed with those for the 30-year norms with only minor differences. Based on averaged parameters, it can be concluded that the 1990&hyph;1992 period was not atypically nonconducive to ozone formation. Thus, the State has adequately demonstrated that the air quality improvement was not due to unusually favorable meteorology.       Comment       A commenter notes that the failure to require correction of the State's part D New Source Review (NSR) program as a condition for approval of the area redesignations is in conflict with the Act and with USEPA guidance. The commenter notes that the USEPA rulemaking statement that part D NSR requirements are not generally applicable upon redesignation to attainment conflicts with section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and is not justified in the USEPA guidance. The commenter notes that, although the USEPA September 4, 1992 policy memorandum implied that there is some flexibility in replacing part D NSR requirements with Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements, a subsequent USEPA September 17, 1993 policy clarification memorandum eliminated this flexibility.   The commenter also notes that the USEPA redesignation rulemaking erroneously allows the removal of existing part D NSR requirements, such as the requirements for offsets and Lowest Achievable Emission Rates (LAER). All of these existing programs disappear or are replaced by a part C PSD program. The commenter argues that the redesignations to attainment are not acceptable unless the NSR part D requirements are retained as contingency measures. It is noted that PSD for sources of ozone precursors does not require emission offsets for new sources, only requires Best Available Control Technology (BACT) emission controls rather than LAER, and has different source emission thresholds than does part D NSR. The implication is that shifting to PSD from part D NSR will weaken emission control requirements without adequate safeguards.   The commenter notes that the statement in the redesignation rulemaking that the section 175A(d) requirement (that all SIP measures be converted to contingency measures) should not apply to part D NSR because of the differing use of the term ``measure'' at section 161 of the Clean Air Act is irrelevant. The relevance of the part C (section 161) reference to a part D NSR requirement is questionable. The allusion to USEPA's historical practices do nothing to negate the explicit imperatives of the Clean Air Act and other USEPA guidance.   The commenter goes on to state that based on USEPA's logic in eliminating the part D NSR requirement, any and all other applicable part D requirements, including those which have been previously met and even relied upon in demonstrating attainment, could be eliminated without an analysis demonstrating that maintenance would be protected.           USEPA Response       USEPA believes that the areas that are the subject of Indiana's redesignation request may be redesignated to attainment notwithstanding the lack of a fully approved NSR program meeting the requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and the absence of such an NSR program from the contingency plan. This view, while a departure from the past policy, has been set forth by the USEPA as its new policy in a memorandum from Mary Nichols, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation (``Part D New Source Review (part D NSR) Requirements for Areas Requesting Redesignation to Attainment,'' October 14, 1994).   USEPA believes that its failure to insist on a fully approved NSR program as a pre-requisite to redesignation to attainment is justifiable as an exercise of the Agency's general authority to establish     de minimis     exceptions to statutory requirements. See     Alabama Power Co. v. Costle,     636 F.2d 323, 360&hyph;61 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Under     Alabama Power Co. v. Costle,     the Agency has the authority to establish     de minimis     exceptions to statutory requirements where the application of the statutory requirements would be of trivial or no value environmentally.       In this context, the issue presented is whether the Agency has the authority to establish an exception to the requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E) that USEPA has fully approved a state implementation plan meeting all of the requirements applicable to the area under section 110 and part D of Title I of the Act. Plainly, the NSR provisions of section 110 and part D are requirements that were applicable to the Indiana areas seeking redesignation at the times of submission of the requests for redesignation. Thus, on its face, section 107(d)(3)(E) would seem to require that the State has submitted and USEPA has fully approved an NSR program meeting the requirements of the Act before the areas could be redesignated to attainment.       Under the Agency's     de minimis     authority, however, it may establish an exception to an otherwise plain statutory requirement if its fulfillment would be of little or no environmental value. In this context, it is necessary to determine what would be achieved by insisting that there be a fully approved NSR program in place prior to the redesignation of the Indiana areas. For the following reasons, USEPA believes that requiring the adoption and full approval of an NSR program prior to redesignation would not be of any significant environmental value in this case.   Indiana has demonstrated that maintenance of the ozone NAAQS will occur even if the emission reductions expected to result from an NSR program due to emission offsets do not occur. The emission projections made by Indiana to demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS considered growth in point source emissions (along with growth for other source categories) and were premised on the assumption that PSD would be in effect, rather than NSR, during the maintenance period. Under NSR, significant point source emissions growth would not occur. Indiana assumed that NSR would not apply after redesignation to attainment, and, therefore, assumed source growth factors based on projected growth in the economy and in the areas' populations. (It should be noted that the growth factors assumed may be overestimates under PSD, which would restrain source growth through the application of best available control techniques.) Thus, contrary to the assertion of the commenters, Indiana has demonstrated that there is no need to retain NSR as an operative program in the state implementation plan during the maintenance period in order to provide for continued maintenance of the NAAQS. (If this demonstration had not been made, NSR would have had to have been retained in the state implementation plan as an operative program since it would have been needed to maintain the ozone standard.)

text: nullnull      The other purpose that requiring the full approval of an NSR program might serve would be to ensure that NSR would become a contingency provision in the maintenance plan required for these areas by sections 107(d)(3)(E)(iv) and 175A(d). These provisions require that, for an area to be redesignated to attainment, it must receive full approval of a maintenance plan containing ``such contingency provisions as the Administrator deems necessary to assure that the State will promptly correct any violation of the standard which occurs after the redesignation of the area as an attainment area. Such provisions shall include a requirement that the State will implement all measures with respect to the control of the air pollutant concerned which were contained in the State implementation plan for the area before redesignation of the area as an attainment area.'' Based on this language, it is apparent that whether an approved NSR program must be included as a contingency provision depends on whether it is considered as a ``measure'' for the control of the pertinent air pollutants.     As USEPA noted in the proposed rulemaking regarding these redesignation requests, the term ``measure'' is not defined in section 175A(d) and Congress utilized that term differently in different provisions of the Act with respect to the PSD and NSR permitting programs. For example, in section 110(a)(2)(A), Congress required State implementation plans to include ``enforceable emission limitations and other control measures, means, or techniques *&blank;*&blank;* as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of the Act.'' In section 110(a)(2)(C), Congress required that State implementation plans include ``a program to provide for the enforcement of the     measures     described in subparagraph (A),     and     regulation of the modification and construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as necessary to assure that national ambient air quality standards are achieved, including a permit program as required in parts C and D.'' (Emphasis added.) If the term ``measures'' as used in sections 110(a)(2) (A) and (C) had been intended to include PSD and NSR there would have been no point to requiring that State implementation plans include both measures     and     preconstruction review under parts C and D (PSD and NSR). Unless ``measures'' referred to something other than preconstruction review under parts C and D, the reference to preconstruction review programs in section 110(a)(2)(C) would be rendered mere surplusage. Thus, in sections 110(a)(2) (A) and (C), it is apparent that Congress distinguished ``measures'' from preconstruction review. On the other hand, in other provisions of the Act, such as section 161, Congress appeared to include PSD within the scope of the term ``measures.''     Contrary to the comments in this proceeding, USEPA does not believe that the fact that Congress used the undefined term ``measure'' differently in different sections of the Act is ``irrelevant.'' Rather, this indicates that the term is susceptible to more than one interpretation and that USEPA has the discretion to interpret it in a reasonable manner in the context of section 175A. Inasmuch as Congress itself has used the term in a manner that excluded PSD and NSR from its scope, USEPA believes it is reasonable to interpret ``measure,'' as used in section 175A(d), not to include NSR. That this is a reasonable interpretation is further supported by the fact that PSD, a program that is the corollary of NSR for attainment areas, goes into effect in lieu of NSR.  1   This distinguishes NSR from other required programs under the Act, such as enhanced inspection and maintenance and reasonably available control technology, which have no corollary for attainment areas. Moreover, USEPA believes that those other required programs are clearly within the scope of the term ``measure.''  2               1      USEPA is not suggesting that NSR and PSD are equivalent, but merely that they are the same type of program.               2      USEPA also notes that, in the case of the Indiana areas, the possible contingency provisions include volatile organic compound (VOC) emission offsets for new and modified major sources; VOC emission offsets for new and modified minor sources; increasing the ratio of emission offsets required for new sources; and VOC controls on new minor sources (less than 100 tons per year). Furthermore, Indiana's construction permit program requires that, prior to constructing any source in any attainment or nonattainment area in the State, it must be demonstrated that the resultant emissions will not exacerbate an existing air quality violation or cause a new violation. This is consistent with USEPA's PSD requirements as specified at 40 CFR 52.21(k) and is provided for in Indiana's State implementation plan (see 40 CFR 52.793(b)).           USEPA disagrees with the commenters' suggestion that USEPA's logic in treating NSR in this manner means that other applicable part D requirements, including those that have been previously met and previously relied upon in demonstrating attainment, could be eliminated without an analysis demonstrating that maintenance would be protected. As noted above, Indiana has demonstrated that maintenance would be protected with PSD in effect, rather than NSR. Thus, USEPA is not permitting NSR to be removed without a demonstration that maintenance of the standard will be achieved. Moreover, USEPA has not amended its policy with respect to the conversion of other State implementation plan elements to contingency provisions, which is that they may be converted to contingency provisions only upon a showing that maintenance will be achieved without them being in effect. Finally, as noted above, USEPA believes that the NSR requirement differs from other requirements, and does not believe that the rationale for the NSR exception extends to other required programs.

text: nullnull      The position taken in this action is consistent with USEPA's current national policy. That policy permits redesignations to proceed without otherwise required NSR programs having been fully approved and converted to contingency provisions provided that the area demonstrates, as has been done in this case, that maintenance will be achieved with the application of PSD rather than NSR.         III. Final Rulemaking Action         The State of Indiana has met the requirements of the Act revising the Indiana ozone SIP. The USEPA approves the redesignation of St. Joseph, Elkhart and Marion Counties, Indiana to attainment of the ozone NAAQS. Final determination is being withheld for Vanderburgh County at this time. Further consideration of the Vanderburgh County redesignation will be made upon completion of the quality assurance of the Alcoa monitoring site data.     This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the     Federal Register     on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.     Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.     Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600     et seq.,     USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.     The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.     Union Electric Co. v. USEPA,     427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976).     Under Section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 30, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

text:   SUMMARY:     NMFS has determined that the 8 metric tons (mt) set-aside for the late-season General category fishery in the New York Bight beginning September 20, 1994, will have been taken by October 26, 1994. Therefore, the General category fishery will be closed effective at 2330 hours (11:30 pm) on Wednesday, October 26, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this fishery.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Regulations implemented under the authority of the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971     et         seq    .) governing the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found at 50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas recommended U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories.      Implementing regulations for the Atlantic Tuna Fisheries at 50 CFR 285.22(a) provide for an annual quota of 531 mt of large medium and giant ABT to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the General category. Of this amount, 65 mt are to be set aside for a late-season fishery beginning September 15. Based on landings statistics, the fishery was closed on August 15, 1994, with only 23 mt remaining for the late-season set-aside. A reallocation of 18 mt from the reserve increased the set-aside to 41 mt, of which 33 mt were allocated to General category fishermen from all areas to be fished from September 15 through September 17, and 8 mt were allocated to the New York Bight fishery to be fished from September 20 until the 8 mt are taken.  Based on landing reports, NMFS has determined that the late-season quota of ABT allocated for General category vessels fishing in the New York Bight must be closed. Fishing for, retention of, possession of, or landing large medium or giant ABT by vessels in the General category must cease by 2330 hours October 26, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota.  This closure of the late-season General category fishery will not affect other categories fishing for ABT.

text:   SUMMARY:     The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is amending 25 CFR 141.10 and 141.33 to change references to the account ``Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor'' to read ``Special Deposits,'' as provided in 25 CFR Part 114_SPECIAL DEPOSITS.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This rulemaking action is to amend Part 141 of Subchapter G of Chapter I of Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which contains general regulations pertaining to reservation businesses and prescribes rules for the licensing of non-member businesses, pawnbrokers and traders who engage in retail business on the Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni Reservations, as required by 25 U.S.C. 261, 262, 263, and 264.         Pursuant to the amendments contained in Pub. L. 97&hyph;257, Title I, &sect;100, (Sept. 10, 1982, 96 Stat. 839), which provide that ``No funds shall be deposited in such `Indian monies, proceeds of labor' (IMPL) accounts after September 30, 1982,'' all deposits to IMPL accounts were discontinued. The IMPL accounts will be removed from the BIA accounting system and are no longer available for use. The references to, ``Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor'' accounts contained in &sect;141.10(d) and &sect;141.33(d) are therefore no longer valid, and are being changed to refer to ``Special Deposits'' accounts, in accordance with the requirements of 25 CFR 114.     A proposed regulation for 25 CFR 141 was published for public comment in the     Federal Register     on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9302). After a thirty-(30-) day comment period, no comments were received.     The primary author of this proposed rule is Loren J. Farmer, Policy, Analysis and Evaluation Staff, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Trust Funds Management, 505 Marquette NW., Suite 700, Albuquerque, NM 87102.     The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.     The Department has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and therefore will not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.     This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601     et seq.    ).     In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant takings implications.     The Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects.     The Department has determined that this rule does not   constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.     There are no information collection requirements requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501     et seq.

Pursuant to the amendments contained in Pub. L. 97&hyph;257, Title I, &sect;100, (Sept. 10, 1982, 96 Stat. 839), which provide that ``No funds shall be deposited in such `Indian monies, proceeds of labor' (IMPL) accounts after September 30, 1982,'' all deposits to IMPL accounts were discontinued. The IMPL accounts will be removed from the BIA accounting system and are no longer available for use. The references to, ``Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor'' accounts contained in &sect;141.10(d) and &sect;141.33(d) are therefore no longer valid, and are being changed to refer to ``Special Deposits'' accounts, in accordance with the requirements of 25 CFR 114.     A proposed regulation for 25 CFR 141 was published for public comment in the     Federal Register     on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9302). After a thirty-(30-) day comment period, no comments were received.     The primary author of this proposed rule is Loren J. Farmer, Policy, Analysis and Evaluation Staff, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Trust Funds Management, 505 Marquette NW., Suite 700, Albuquerque, NM 87102.     The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.     The Department has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and therefore will not be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.     This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601     et seq.    ).     In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant takings implications.     The Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects.     The Department has determined that this rule does not   constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

The law eliminated the use of IMPL accounts, and since these accounts are no longer in use, they will be removed from the BIA accounting system.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     This rulemaking action deletes Part 113 of Subchapter G of Chapter I of Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which contains regulations governing Indian Monies, Proceeds of Labor (IMPL) established under the Act of March 3, 1883, as amended (25 U.S.C. 155).         Pursuant to the amendments contained in Public Law 97&hyph;257, Title I, Section 100, 25 U.S.C. 155 B, which provided that, ``No funds shall be deposited in such `Indian monies, proceeds of labor' (IMPL) accounts after September 30, 1982,'' all deposits to IMPL accounts were discontinued. The unobligated IMPL balances at the close of business on September 30, 1982, including the income resulting from investment of funds from such accounts prior to such date, were transferred to and held in escrow accounts. After consultation with appropriate tribes and individual Indians up to September 30, 1985, to determine the extent to which the funds held in escrow accounts represented income from the investment of ``special deposits'' relating to individual Indians or a specific tribe, funds were transferred to appropriate trust accounts for individual Indians and tribes during the period of October 1, 1985, through September 30, 1987. The unobligated balances of the IMPL escrow accounts as of the close of business on September 30, 1987, are to be withdrawn and deposited into miscellaneous receipts of the U.S. Treasury. The IMPL accounts are to be removed from the Bureau of Indian Affairs trust accounting system and are no longer available for use.

text:   SUMMARY:     Effective for the 1995 crop year only, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) herewith gives notice of its determination to extend the date for acceptance of applications for small grains (wheat, oats, rye, and barley), sugarcane, potatoes, and nursery crop insurance for all policies having a September 30 sales closing date.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Under its regulations for insuring crops, FCIC requires that applications for crop insurance protection must be filed on or before the policy sales closing date. The small grains, potatoes, surgarcane, and nursery crop insurance policies have a sales closing date in some areas of September 30. Due to the uncertain nature of improvements being made to agricultural risk management policies, producers have requested that FCIC extend the sales closing dates to allow producers opportunity to assess their risk management needs and make an informed decision as to the purchase of crop insurance. Therefore, to assist those producers who have requested an extension of sales closing date, the Manager of FCIC has determined that the September 30 sales closing date shall be extended to October 31.           Under the provisions of the General Crop Insurance Regulations (&sect;401.8 and &sect;457.8), the sales closing date for accepting applications may be extended by notice in the     Federal Register     upon determination that no adverse selection will result from such extension. FCIC has determined that no adverse selection will result from this extension.    FCIC will discontinue the acceptance of applications if it determines that the insurance risk because excessive and adverse conditions develop.        Notice          Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501     et seq.    ), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation herewith gives notice that, effective for the 1995 crop year only, applications for wheat, barley, oats, rye, nursery, potatoes, and surgarcane crop insurance with sales closing prior to October 31, 1994, will be accepted up to the     close of business on October 31, 1994,     for producers requesting multiple peril crop insurance coverage. This sales closing may be terminated by the Corporation prior to October 31, 1994 if the insurance risk becomes excessive and adverse conditions develop.

Postponement of Preliminary Determination        The Department of Commerce (``the Department'') is postponing its preliminary determination in the antidumping duty investigation of ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium from the Russian Federation (``Russia''). The deadline for issuing this preliminary determination is now no later than December 27, 1994.    On June 20, 1994, the Department initiated an antidumping duty investigation of ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium from Russia (59 FR 3952, June 27, 1994). The preliminary determination was scheduled for November 7, 1994.    On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission determined that there was a likelihood that a U.S. domestic industry was materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of ferrovanadium and nitrided vanadium from Russia.    This investigation involves unusually complex foreign trading channels and, therefore, we have determined that this investigation is extraordinarily complicated within the meaning of section 733(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(2). Furthermore, we have determined that the parties concerned are cooperating, as required by section 733(c)(1)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(1), and that additional time is necessary to make this preliminary determination in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(3).    For these reasons, the deadline, for issuing this determination is now no later than December 27, 1994.    This notice is published pursuant to section 733(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(d).           Dated: September 26, 1994.        <SIGNER>  Susan G.

Case History        Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994, (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred.    On April 14, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination (see, ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;691).    In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b) (1994), on April 29, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to Malaysia Mining Corporation Pipe &amp; Fitting Sdn Bhd (MMCPNF), the Malaysian company identified by both petitioner and the U.S. Embassy in Malaysia (by cable to the Department) as the primary exporter of the subject merchandise to the U.S. during the POI.    On May 27, 1994, the Department received a letter from the Government of Malaysia stating that MMCPNF was placed in receivership in October 1993, ceased production at that time, and is currently in the process of selling its assets. Therefore, MMCPNF would not be responding to the Department's antidumping duty questionnaire.    On June 3, 1994, the Department received a letter from petitioner in which the petitioner named another Malaysian producer of pipe fittings, Taiyo Steel Corporation (Taiyo). In order to ensure that all potential respondents were identified, we then cabled the U.S. Embassy in Malaysia a second time requesting information on Taiyo and any other Malaysian producers of pipe fittings. The U.S. Embassy responded that no company by that name could be found and identified no other Malaysian producers of pipe fittings.

text: nullnull      On June 30, 1994, petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination. The request was granted by the Department on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994).    On August 4, 1994, the Department received an amendment to the petition alleging that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of pipe fittings from Malaysia. In accordance with section 735(a)(3) of the Act, on August 12, 1994, the Department issued a letter to MMCPNF requesting monthly volume and value shipment data for the period January 1, 1992, through September 27, 1994. The Department has received no reply to this request.        Scope of Investigation        The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings (``pipe fittings'') having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening (    e.g.,     threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States     (``HTSUS'').    Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.        Period of Investigation        The period of investigation is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994.        Best Information Available          MMCPNF did not respond to our questionnaire. Therefore, we have based our preliminary determination on best information available (BIA) pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act, which provides that the Department shall use BIA when a company identified by the Department as a respondent refuses to provide requested information.    In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents who did not cooperate in an investigation. According to this methodology, as outline in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings, Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings, from Germany, 54 FR 18992, 19033 (May 3, 1989), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of 1) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or 2) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. (    See Allied Signal Aerospace Co.     v.     United States,     996 F. 2d 1185,1191&hyph;92 (Fed. Cir. 1993).) Because there were no cooperative respondents in this investigation, we are assigning to all exporters, as BIA, the highest margin calculated in the petition, adjusted for methodological errors as explained in the Department's initiation notice. The adjusted rate is 194.7 percent.                Critical Circumstances            Petitioner has alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Malaysia. Section 735(a)(3) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances exist if:        (A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the U.S. or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation, or      (ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and      (B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of this investigation over a relatively short period.

Case History        Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994, (59 FR 141148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred.    On April 14, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination in this case.    On May 2, 1994, counsel for COVECO C.A. (Coveco) and Petroltubos S.A. (Petroltubos), the only two producers of the subject merchandise in Venezuela, notified the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') that due to the insignificant quantity and value of exports to the United States, these companies would not be responding to the Department's questionnaire in this investigation.    The petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination on June 30, 1994. The request was granted by the Department of Commerce on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994).

PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION:     We preliminarily determine that certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from India are being sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the ``Act''). The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.        Case History          Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994, (59 FR 14148) the following events have occurred.    On April 14, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination (    see     ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;689).    In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b)(1994), antidumping duty questionnaires were presented to two Indian producers which account for over 60 percent of all Indian exports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings to the United States during the POI. These companies are Karmen Steels of India (Karmen) and Sivanandha Pipe Fittings Limited (Sivanandha).    The petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination on June 30, 1994. The request was granted by the Department of Commerce on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994).        Scope of the Investigation        The products covered by these investigations are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished form fittings based on other methods of fastening (e.g., threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.        Period of Investigation        The period of investigation (``POI'') is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994 for Sivanandha and August 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994 for Karmen. Although we originally established the same POI for both companies, Karmen was not able to provide foreign market values (FMV) for sales during that period because it had no home market or third country sales and its U.S. sale(s) involved merchandise which had not yet been produced. Therefore, in accordance with section 353.42(b)(1) of our regulations, we extended Karmen's POI by one month in order to capture sales of merchandise that had been produced.        Product Comparisons        For Sivanandha, we first compared merchandise identical in all respects. If no identical merchandise was sold, we compared the most similar merchandise, as determined by the model-matching criteria contained in Appendix V of the questionnaire (``Appendix V'') (on file in room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce (``Public File'')). For the U.S. sales compared to sales of similar merchandise, we made an adjustment, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.57, for physical differences in merchandise.

text: nullnull      Karmen, did not make home market or third country sales of the subject merchandise. Therefore, we based FMV on constructed value (CV), in accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Act.    Additionally, Karmen reported that it has an arrangement with a Singaporean company, under which the Singaporean company supplies Karmen with rusty pipe fittings. Karmen reconditions and refurbishes these pipe fittings and exports them to the Singaporean company's U.S. customer. Karmen claims that since the Singaporean company only pays Karmen for the refurbishing, and Karmen does not take title to this merchandise, these sales should not be treated as Karmen sales. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are not treating these refurbished pipe fittings as sales subject to this investigation. We will further examine this issue for purposes of the final determination.        Fair Value Comparisons        To determine whether Sivanandha's or Karmen's sales for export to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.        United States Price        Because Sivanandha's and Karmen's U.S. sales of subject merchandise were made to unrelated purchasers prior to importation into the United States, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology.    We calculated Sivanandha's PP sales based on packed, CIF prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions to the USP, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, containerization, ocean freight, and marine insurance.    In accordance with Section 772(d)(1)(B) of the Act, we added to Sivanandha's USP the amount of import duties imposed on inputs which were subsequently rebated upon exportation of the finished merchandise to the United States.    We made an adjustment to U.S. price for excise and sales taxes paid on the comparison sales in India, in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in     Federal-Mogul, et al.     v.     United States,     834 F. Supp. 1993. See     Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination and Postponement of Final Determination; Color Negative Photographic Paper and Chemical Components Thereof from Japan,     59 FR 16177, 16179, April 6, 1994, for an explanation of this tax methodology.    We calculated Karmen's PP sales based on packed, CIF prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions to the USP, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, containerization, ocean freight and marine insurance. In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the borrowing rate in the United States on short-term dollar-denominated loans. For a further discussion of the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see     Memorandum from Barbara R. Stafford to Susan G. Esserman     (September 26, 1994) on file in room B&hyph;099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce.        Foreign Market Value        For Sivanandha, in order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. As a result, we determined that Sivanandha's home market was viable.    We adjusted for a excise and sales tax collected in the Indian home market. (    See     the United States Price section of this notice, above.)    For Karmen, because it sells the subject merchandise only in the U.S. market, we used CV, pursuant to section 773(e) of the Act. We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. imputed credit costs, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act, we: (1) Included the greater of either Karmen's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM), as appropriate and; (2) used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses for profit. In reporting its CVs, Karmen allocated labor costs and variable manufacturing overhead in such a way as to assign equal amounts for new pipe fittings and refurbished pipe fittings. We believe that the allocation method Karmen used to report CVs results in understating the costs of producing new fittings, because based on our experience in past cases, we would expect that costs incurred in the early production stages would not be incurred in refurbishing fittings. Therefore, we have recalculated these costs by assigning all labor and variable manufacturing overhead costs to the production of new pipe fittings. We will seek additional information on the actual costs for purposes of the final determination.    Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale (COS) adjustments for differences in movement charges between shipments to the United States and shipments to India. For Sivanandha, we also made COS adjustments for differences in quality inspection charges, credit and advertising expenses. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1), we added U.S. indirect selling expenses as an offset to the home market commission, but capped this addition by the amount of the home market commission. Finally, we deducted home market packing expenses and added U.S. packing expenses to Sivanandha's FMV, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.        Currency Conversion        We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.

Suspension of Liquidation        In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from India, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the     Federal Register    . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margins, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:       <TABLE>     &blank;  1Manufacturers/producers/exporters  1Margin percent          Sivanandha    10.16    Karmen    37.04    All others    15.85   </TABLE>       Article VI, paragraph 5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provides that ``(no) product *&blank;*&blank;* shall be subject to both antidumping and countervailing duties to compensate for the same situation for dumping or export subsidization.'' This provision is implemented by section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act. Since antidumping duties cannot be assessed on the portion of the margin attributable to export subsidies, there is no basis to require a cash deposit or bond for that amount.    Accordingly in this investigation, Sivanandha's FMV is based on home market sales and hence, the antidumping margin must be adjusted. In the     Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from India,     (59 FR 28337, published June 1, 1994), Sivanandha's export subsidy was 3.53 percent ad valorem, which will be subtracted from the margins for cash deposit or bonding purposes. The rate listed above reflects this adjustment. Since Karmen only has U.S. sales, its FMV is based on CV which reflects export subsidies. Because the export subsidies were reflected in both USP and FMV, the subsidies did not affect the margin calculations using CV.    The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margins, as shown above. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.        ITC Notification        In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination.        Public Comment        Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B&hyph;099, within ten days of the publication of this notice. Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and (3) a list of the issues to be discussed.    In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the Assistant Secretary no later than November 16, 1994, and rebuttal briefs no later than November 23, 1994. A hearing, if requested, will be held on November 28, 1994, at 1 p.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce in Room 1414. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours prior to the scheduled time. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs.    We will make our final determination not later than 75 days after the date of this preliminary determination.    This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).           Dated: September 26, 1994.       <SIGNER>  Susan G.

Preliminary Determination:     We have preliminarily determined that certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France are being sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Act''), as amended. The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.        Case History         Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994 (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred:     On April 11, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination (    see,     ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;688, 59 FR 18825 (April 20, 1994)).     In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b), the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to Interfit, S.A. (``interfit'') and its related U.S. company, Vallourec, Inc. (``Vallourec''), on April 29, 1994. Interfit is the only company named in the petition as a producer and exporter to the United States of the subject merchandise.     On June 14, 1994, petitioner alleged that Interfit was selling the subject merchandise in France at less than its cost of production (``COP''). We found reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales in the home market were being made at less than COP and thus initiated a COP investigation.     On June 30, 1994, petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination. The request was granted by the Department on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994).     On August 4, 1994, petitioner alleged critical circumstances with regard to imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France.     On September 6, 1994, Interfit submitted constructed value (``CV'') data for models reflecting a large percentage of sales made in the United States during the period of investigation (``POI''). On September 23, 1994, Interfit provided CV information for the remaining models sold in the United States.         Scope of the Investigation         The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening (    e.g.     threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS'').     Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.         Period of Investigation         The POI is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994.         Fair Value Comparisons         To determine whether Interfit's sales for export to the Untied States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.        United States Price        Because Interfit's U.S. sales of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings were made to an unrelated distributor in the United States prior to importation, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances, we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act.

text: nullnull      We calculated Interfit's PP sales based on packed, c.i.f., duty paid, landed prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions to the U.S. price, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage, marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. brokerage, U.S. duties, and rebates.    No commissions were paid to unrelated distributors in the United States or home market, and we do not have an appropriate benchmark against which to test whether the commission arrangements between Interfit and its related party are at arm's length. Therefore, we did not make an adjustment for commissions claimed by Interfit that were paid to its U.S. subsidiary for various charges incurred in selling the subject merchandise. (    See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Coated Groundwood Paper from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and the United Kingdom,     56 FR 56359, November 4, 1992.)        Foreign Market Value        In order to determine whether Interfit had a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. On this basis, we determined that the home market was viable. For purposes of calculating FMV, we used reported CV for products sold by Interfit in the United States during the POI.        Cost of Production        Interfit provided incomplete and inappropriate cost data for home market sales. Specifically, Interfit did not provide COP information for all comparison models sold in France during the POI. Furthermore, Interfit provided transfer prices for the main input into its pipe fittings. As this input was purchased from related parties, it is the Department's practice to use the cost of producing the input, rather than the transfer price. See     Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Venezuela     (58 FR 27522; 1993). Finally, the costs reported by Interfit did not reflect the specific time period requested by the Department.    Accordingly, we do not have the information necessary to make a determination whether Interfit's home market sales are being sold below the COP. In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act as best information available (``BIA'') we have determined that all sales in the home market were made at less than the COP and, in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we have based foreign market value on CV.        Constructed Value          We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act, we (1) included the greater of Interfit's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate, and (2) used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses for profit.    For comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for differences in credit expenses between the two markets, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the rate respondent reported at which it could borrow in U.S. dollars during the POI. (For further discussions regarding the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see September 26, 1994, Memorandum to Susan G. Esserman from Barbara R. Stafford on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Department of Commerce.) We have not made a deduction for the direct selling expenses reported by respondent. We have determined that these expenses (product liability premiums and inventory carrying costs) are, in fact, indirect selling expenses.    Because of the deficiencies in the cost data described above, we are requesting further information from Interfit. We also intend to verify that the prices paid by Interfit to its related suppliers are, in fact, at arms-length.    The CV data originally provided by Interfit did not cover all of the models sold by the company in the United States during the POI. On September 23, 1994, Interfit supplied the CV data for the remaining models. Because this information was not received in time to be used in this preliminary determination, we have used BIA for sales involving these models. As BIA, we have imputed the highest non-aberrational margin calculated from the CV information that Interfit submitted on September 6, 1994. (    See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products and Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Netherlands    , 58 FR 37199; July 9, 1993). In our final determination, we intend to use all the CV data submitted by Interfit so long as it can be verified.        Currency Conversion        We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.        Critical Circumstances        Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of the subject merchandise from France. Section 733(e)(1) of the Act provides that the Department will determine that critical circumstances exist if:

text: nullnull      Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication XXX        1994 May 23        Announcing the Standard for Cryptographic Service Calls        Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235.           1. Name of Standard. Cryptographic Service Calls (FIPS PUB XXX).    2. Category of Standard. Computer Security, Cryptography.    3. Explanation. This standard specifies a set of generic cryptographic service calls, or applications program interface (API), for application programs to interface with a cryptographic module for requesting cryptographic functions. The service calls specify the interface for common cryptographic functions such as message encryption and decryption, message authentication, digital signature generation and verification, key management, and user authentication. Cryptographic algorithms that are supported include both secret-key based and public-key based algorithms. In this standard, the terms     cryptographic service calls     and     cryptographic APIs     can be used interchangeably.    4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce.    5. Maintenance Agency. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (Computer Systems Laboratory).    6. Cross Index.           a. FIPS PUB 46&hyph;2, Data Encryption Standard.    b.

Special Publication 800&hyph;2, Public Key Cryptography.    j. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations (FIRMR) subpart 201.20.303, Standards, and subpart 201.39.1002, Federal Standards.           Other NIST publications may be applicable to the implementation and use of this standard. A list (NIST Publications List 91) of currently available computer security publications, including ordering information, can be obtained from NIST.           7. Objectives. A standard cryptographic interface will facilitate interoperability among different cryptographic implementations. Specifically, a standard set of cryptographic service calls provides the following advantages:           a. Application programmers will need to learn only one set of cryptographic service calls for multiple cryptographic applications.    b. Cryptographic modules from different vendors, which conform to this interface standard, may be interfaced to a given application without requiring modification to the application program.    c. Contracts for additional cryptographic modules would not have to be sole sourced because multiple vendors would offer the standard service calls.    d. Vendors could build cryptographic modules which would interface to a wide variety of applications.           8. Applicability. This standard is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies that use cryptographic-based security systems for the protection of unclassified information that is not subject to Section 2315 of Title 10, U.S. Code, or Section 3502(2) of Title 44, U.S. Code. The standard shall be used by all Federal departments and agencies in designing, acquiring and implementing cryptographic services where a cryptographic interface is to be provided. Not all of the service calls specified in this standard need to be used in its entirety by an application. The specific service calls that shall be used depend on the security requirements for the particular application and environment in which the system is to be utilized. Private and commercial organizations are encouraged to adopt and use this standard in order to facilitate interoperability among different cryptographic products.    9. Applications. The standard may be used in any application which uses cryptography to provide any of the following cryptographic functions: message encryption/decryption, message authentication, digital signature generation and verification, and key management. Not all the service calls specified in this standard need to be used by an application. An application can make use of additional service calls not available in this standard.    10. Specifications. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) XXX,     Cryptographic Service Calls.    11. Implementations. Though this document specifies a standard interface for requesting cryptographic functions, the standard, however, does not mandate a specific implementation of these cryptographic functions other than what are explicitly specified in the document. The cryptographic functions may in fact be implemented in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. However, there may be other standards that are applicable to the implementation of specific cryptographic functions. For specific requirements, the individual standard shall be referred to. Conformance to this standard requires that the cryptographic service calls used by an application provide exactly the same name and letter case for the service calls and their parameters as specified in the standard. In the rare case where the standard naming and specification of the service calls and parameters may violate certain rules of a particular programming language in use, the exception should be noted and the selected naming and case specification should match the standard as much as possible.    12. Export Control. Certain cryptographic devices and technical data regarding them are deemed to be defense articles (i.e., inherently military in character) and are subject to Federal government export controls as specified in Title 22, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 120&hyph;128. Some exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical data regarding them must comply with these Federal regulations and be licensed by the U.S. Department of State. Other exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical data regarding them fall under the licensing authority of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce is responsible for licensing cryptographic devices used for authentication, access control, proprietary software, automatic teller machines (ATMs), and certain devices used in other equipment and software. For advice concerning which agency has licensing authority for a particular cryptographic device, please contact the respective agencies.    13. Implementation Schedule. This standard becomes effective six months after publication of a notice in the     Federal Register     of its approval by the Secretary of Commerce.    14. Qualifications. While this standard specifies a standard interface for application programs to request cryptographic functions from a cryptographic module, conformance to this standard does not assure that a particular cryptographic module or implementation is secure. Security requirements for a cryptographic module are addressed in FIPS 140&hyph;1. The responsible authority in each agency or department shall assure that the overall system provides an acceptable level of security.

text:   SUMMARY:     Subject to the availability of funds, NMFS issues this notice describing funding to assist persons in carrying out research and development projects that optimize the use of U.S. Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (North Carolina to Florida) fisheries involving the U.S. fishing industry (recreational and commercial), including fishery biology, resource assessment, socio-economic assessment, management and conservation, selected harvesting methods, and fish handling and processing. NMFS issues this notice describing the conditions under which applications will be accepted and how NMFS will determine which applications will be selected for funding. Areas of this Marine Fisheries Initiative (MARFIN) emphasis for FY 1995 were formulated from recommendations received from non-Federal scientific and technical experts, and NMFS research and operations officials.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           I. Authority.      The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) is authorized under 15 U.S.C. 713c&hyph;3(d) to enter into cooperative agreements for research and development addressed to all aspects of U.S. fisheries.       II. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA).       This program is described in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under program number 11.433, Marine Fisheries Initiative.      III. Program Description.      MARFIN is a competitive Federal grant program that promotes and endorses programs that seek to optimize economic and social benefits from marine fishery resources through cooperative efforts that involve the best research and management talents to accomplish priority activities. Preference is given to selecting and funding applications for project grants that provide an opportunity for cooperative NMFS/applicant efforts and for multiple cooperating applicants/NMFS efforts with up to 3-year time horizons. Projects funded under MARFIN are focused into cooperative efforts that provide clear answers for fishery needs covered by the NMFS Strategic Plan, available from the Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ), particularly those goals relating to rebuilding overfished marine fisheries, maintaining currently productive fisheries, and integrating conservation of protected species and fisheries management.  Applications from multiple cooperating applicants that address conservation and management needs over a wide range of a fishery or fishery organism are encouraged. Emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest probability of recovering, maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment success; and/or generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries. Projects will be evaluated as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through both short-term and long-term research efforts, with consideration of the magnitude of the eventual economic or social benefits that may be realized. Short-term projects that may yield more immediate benefits, and projects yielding longer-term benefits will receive equal consideration.      IV. Funding Availability.      This solicitation announces that funding of approximately $1.25 million may be available in FY 1995 pending Congressional appropriation. MARFIN financial assistance started in FY 1986, and for FY 1986 through FY 1994, awards totaled about $15.5 million for financial assistance to conduct research for fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico and off the South Atlantic states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There is no guarantee that sufficient funds will be available to make awards for all approved projects.  Project proposals accepted for funding for a project period over 1 year that include multiple project components or severable tasks to be funded each budget period will not compete for funding in subsequent budget periods within the approved project period. However, funding for subsequent project components is contingent upon the availability of funds from Congress and satisfactory performance, and will be at the sole discretion of the agency. Publication of this notice does not obligate NMFS to award any specific cooperative agreement or to obligate all or any parts of the available funds.      V. Matching Requirements.      Applications must reflect the total budget necessary to accomplish the project, including contributions and/or donations. Cost-sharing is not required for the MARFIN program. However, cost-sharing is encouraged, and in case of a tie in considering proposals for funding, cost-sharing may affect the final decision. The appropriateness of all cost-sharing will be determined on the basis of guidance provided in applicable Federal cost principles. If an applicant chooses to cost-share, and if that application is selected for funding, the applicant will be bound by the percentage of the cost share reflected in the cooperative agreement award.  The non-Federal share may include funds received from private sources or from state or local governments, or the value of in-kind contributions by the applicant or third parties. Federal funds may not be used to meet the non-Federal share of matching funds, except as provided by Federal statute. In-kind contributions may be in the form of, but are not limited to, personal services rendered in carrying out functions related to the project, and use of real or personal property owned by others (for which consideration is not required) in carrying out the projects.  The total cost of a project begins on the effective date of a cooperative agreement between the applicant and the NOAA Grants Officer and ends on the date specified in the award. Accordingly, time expended and costs incurred in either the development of a project or the financial assistance application, or in any subsequent discussions or negotiations prior to the award, are neither reimbursable nor recognizable as part of the recipient's cost share.      VI. Type of Funding Instrument.      The cooperative agreement has been determined to be the appropriate funding instrument. NMFS is substantially involved in developing program research priorities, conducting cooperative activities with recipients, and evaluating the performance of recipients for effectiveness in meeting national and regional goals for fishery research in the southeastern United States.      VII. Eligibility Criteria.      1. Applications for cooperative agreements for MARFIN projects may be made, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this notice, by:  a. Any individual who is a citizen or national of the United States;  b. Any corporation, partnership, or other entity, non-profit or otherwise, if such entity is a citizen of the United States within the meaning of section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended (46 app. U.S.C. 802).  c. Colleges and universities, and game and fish departments of the several states.  2. NOAA employees, including full-time, part-time, and intermittent personnel (or their immediate families), and NOAA offices or centers are not eligible to submit an application under this solicitation, or aid in the preparation of an application during the 60-day solicitation period, except to provide information about the MARFIN program and the priorities and procedures included in this solicitation. However, NOAA employees are permitted to provide information about ongoing and planned NOAA programs and activities that may have implication for an application. Potential applicants are encouraged to contact Ms. Ellie Roche at the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ) for information on NOAA programs. Documents available from that office that may be useful to the applicant include:  a. A Cooperative Reef Fish Research Program for the Gulf of Mexico.  b. A Cooperative Bycatch Research Plan for the Southeast Region.  c. Strategic Plan of the National Marine Fisheries Service.  d. National Status of Stocks Report.  e. Various fishery management plans and plan amendments produced by the Councils and the Commissions.  f. Report of a Workshop on Grouper Reproduction, November 1993.      VIII. Award Period.      The award period for the project may be made for more than one year consisting of one, two, or three budget periods which correspond to the funding for the proposed project components. The award period will depend upon the duration of funding requested by the applicant in the Application for Federal Assistance, the decision of the NMFS selecting official on the amount of funding, the results of post-selection negotiations between the applicant and NOAA officials, and preaward review of the application by NOAA and Department of Commerce (DOC) officials. Normally, each project budget period may be no more than 18 months in duration. NOAA policy limits the total duration of a project to about 3 years.       IX. Indirect Costs.      The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award, or 25 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less. Institutions with indirect cost rates above 25 percent may use the amount above the 25&hyph;percent level as part of the non-Federal share. A copy of the current, approved, negotiated Indirect Cost Agreement with the Federal government must be included with the application.      X. Profit or Fees.      Profit or management fees paid to for-profit or commercial organization grantees are allowable at the discretion of NOAA. However, they shall not exceed 7 percent of the total estimated direct costs. There must be no profit or fees to the recipient in any overhead charge. Payment of fees or profit is based on successful completion of project objectives.      XI. Application Forms and Kit.      Before submitting an application under this program, applicants should contact the NMFS Southeast Regional Office for a copy of this solicitation's MARFIN Application Package (see     ADDRESSES    ).  Applications for project funding under this program must be complete and be in accordance with instructions in the MARFIN Application Package. They must identify the principal participants and include copies of any agreements describing the specific tasks to be performed by participants. Project applications should give a clear presentation of the proposed work, the methods for carrying out the project, its relevance to managing and enhancing the use of Gulf of Mexico and/or South Atlantic fishery resources, and cost estimates as they relate to specific aspects of the project. Budgets must include a detailed breakdown, by category of expenditures, with appropriate justification for both the Federal and non-Federal shares. Applicants should not assume prior knowledge on the part of NMFS as to the relative merits of the project described in the application. Applications are not to be bound in any manner and should be one-sided. All incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant. Three copies (one original and two copies) of each application are required, and should be submitted to the NMFS Southeast Regional Office, Cooperative Programs Division (see     ADDRESSES    ).      XII. Project Funding Priorities.      A. Proposals for FY 1995 should exhibit familiarity with related work that is completed or ongoing. Where appropriate, proposals should be multidisciplinary. Coordinated efforts involving multiple institutions or persons are encouraged. The areas of special emphasis are listed below, but proposals in other areas will be considered on a funds-available basis.  In addition to referencing specific area(s) of special interest as listed below, proposals should state whether the research will apply to the Gulf of Mexico only, the South Atlantic only, or to both areas. Successful applicants may be required to collect and manage data in accordance with standardized procedures and formats approved by NMFS, and to participate with NMFS in specific cooperative activities that will be determined by consultations between NMFS and successful applicants before project grants are awarded. Recipients of financial assistance for projects with multiple project periods must include funding in their applications for travel expenses for the principal investigator to participate in one annual project review and evaluation meeting in St. Petersburg, FL. All recipients of financial assistance under this program shall include funding in their applications for the principal investigator to participate in an annual MARFIN Conference at the completion of the project.  Research needs identified in fishery management plans (FMPs) and amendments prepared by the Gulf and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and the Gulf and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commissions (Commissions) are included. For availability of these documents, contact the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ). Areas of special emphasis for FY 1995 include:  1.     Shrimp Trawler Bycatch    .  Studies are needed to contribute to the regional shrimp trawler bycatch program being conducted by NMFS in cooperation with state fishery management agencies, commercial and recreational fishing organizations and interests, environmental organizations, universities, Councils, and Commissions. Specific guidance and research requirements are contained in the Regional Bycatch Plan prepared through the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation. In particular, the studies should address:  a. Data collection and analyses to expand and update current bycatch estimates temporally and spatially from offshore, nearshore, and inshore waters, emphasizing areas of greatest shrimping impact. Sampling effort should include estimates of numbers, weight, and age structure of the associated bycatch complex.  b. Assessments of the status and condition of fish stocks significantly impacted by shrimp trawler bycatch, with emphasis given to overfished species under the jurisdiction of the Councils.  c. Identification, development, and evaluation of gear, non- gear and tactical fishing options to reduce bycatch.  d. Improved methods for communicating with and improving technology and information transfer to the shrimp industry.  e. Social and economic impacts of management options to reduce shrimp fishery bycatch.   2.     Highly Migratory Pelagic Fisheries    .  a.     Longline Fisheries, Including Bycatch    .  A number of pelagic longline fisheries exist in the Gulf and South Atlantic, targeting highly migratory species such as tunas, some sharks, and swordfish. These fisheries have evolved rapidly over the last decade, with increases in fishing effort and changes in fishing gear and tactics. These changes need to be characterized and their effects quantified. High priority areas include:  (1) Characterization of specific longline fisheries, including targeted species, stock identification, catch-per-unit-effort of bycatch, and biological parameters (e.g., sex ratios and reproductive state) by gear type, area and season.  (2) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fisheries.  (3) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize bycatch of undersized and unwanted species, including sea turtles and marine mammals.  (4) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries, including biological, social, and economic factors and effects.   (5) Dependence of vessels and persons engaged in pelagic longlining on other fisheries. Particular emphasis should be placed on the extent to which the capital and/or labor engages in other fisheries at particular times of the year and reasons for this switching behavior.  b.     Sharks    .  A Secretarial FMP for sharks has been developed that identifies a number of research needs, including:  (1) Characterization of the commercial and recreational fisheries from historical and current databases. Emphasis should be on species composition, bycatch, stock identification, size, sex ratios and catch-per-unit-effort by season, area, and gear type.  (2) Collection and analysis of basic biological data on movements, habitats, growth rates, mortality rates, age structure and reproduction parameters. These data are of particular importance for blacktip and sandbar sharks. Information on the relationship of sandbar sharks to water depth and determination of the southern boundary of its range are specifically needed.  (3) Determination of baseline cost and returns for commercial fisheries that land sharks, and estimation of demand curves for shark products and recreational shark fisheries.   (4) Development of species profiles and stock assessments for sharks taken in significant quantities by commercial and recreational fishers, and as bycatch in other fisheries. Assessments can be species-specific or for species groups, following those identified in the Atlantic Sharks FMP.  (5) Identification of coastal sharks, using laboratory methodologies.  (6) Development of a more precise and accurate estimate of the recreational shark fishery. Proposals in this area must demonstrate a knowledge of the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistical Survey (MRFSS), and should indicate a willingness to participate directly in the MRFSS through add-on surveys or enhancement of current surveys.  (7) Development of fishery-independent abundance indices.  3.     Reef Fish    .  A number of species within the reef fish complex are showing signs of being overfished, either by directed efforts or as bycatch in other fisheries. The ecology of reef fish makes them vulnerable to overfishing because they tend to concentrate over specific types of habitats with patchy distribution. This behavior pattern can make traditional fishery statistics misleading. Priority research areas include:  a. Collection of basic biological data for species in commercially and recreationally important fisheries.  (1) Age and growth of reef fish.  (a) Description of age and growth patterns (especially red snapper, gray triggerfish and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic).  (b) Development of annual age-length keys for vermilion snapper in the northern Gulf and west coast central Florida, and for red grouper in the Gulf, along with new growth models for red grouper that include possible density-dependent effects, as well as environmental effects.  (2) Reproduction studies of reef fish.  (a) Maturity schedules and fecundity of commercially and recreationally important reef fish (especially gray triggerfish and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico).  (b) Detailed histological studies of red snapper to characterize the actual reproductive contribution of females, by age.  (c) Identification and characterization of spawning aggregations by species, areas, and seasons. Information is especially needed on changes in sex ratios for gag grouper caused by fishing on spawning aggregations.  (d) Reproductive studies covering extensive geographic distributions along the southeastern U.S. coast (North Carolina through the Florida Keys). Samples should be obtained from recreational (private and headboats) and commercial vessels.  (e) Reproductive biology of gag, red grouper and other grouper species. Of particular importance are evaluation of sperm limitation, determination of the proximal causes of sex change (whether behavioral or developmental), determination of the annual periodicity of sex-change induction and age-specific spawning frequency, and other research identified in the recommendations of the workshop on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November 1993.  (3) Recruitment of reef fish.  (a) Source of recruitment in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic waters (especially amberjack and vermilion snapper), and possible Caribbean source for Florida Keys snapper and grouper.  (b) Annual estimation of the absolute or relative recruitment of juvenile gag to the seagrass beds off the west coast of Florida and to similar estuarine nursery habitats along the South Atlantic Bight; development of an index of juvenile gag recruitment for the South Atlantic based on historical databases and/or field studies.  (c) Evaluation of the contribution of live-bottom habitat to reef fish recruitment   (4) Stock structure of reef fish.  (a) Movement and migration patterns of commercially and recreationally valuable reef fish species (especially gag and greater amberjack in the South Atlantic).  (b) Techniques to allow field separation of lesser amberjack, almaco jack, and banded rudderfish from greater amberjack to facilitate accurate reporting of catch.  (c) Stock structure of gag and wreckfish in the South Atlantic, and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic.  (d) Use of parasitological surveys in species such as wreckfish and white grunt to determine stock structure.  b. Behavioral studies of reef fish.  (1) Description of the behavior of age&hyph;0 and age&hyph;1 red snapper.  (2) Effects of fishing on reproductive behavior, in formation of aggregations and disruption of existing aggregations.  c. Population assessment of reef fish.  (1) Effect of reproductive mode and sex change (protogynous hermaphroditism) on population size and characteristics, with reference to sizes of fish exploited in the fisheries and the significance to proper management.  (2) Design of sampling routines to provide a production-style aging program representative of the reef fish fishery. Effective dock-side sampling programs, especially for groupers, are needed over a wide geographic range to collect information on reproductive state, size, age, and sex. These research needs are discussed in the report of the workshop on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November 1993.  (3) Source and quantification of natural and human-induced mortalities.   (4) Determination of the habitat and limiting factors for important reef fish resources (such as snappers in the Gulf of Mexico). Information is also needed on the importance of human-created and natural channels for controlling stock sizes and growth rates of snappers and groupers.  (5) Description of habitat and fish populations in the deep reef community and the prey distributions supporting the community.  (6) Evaluation of the effect of misidentifying gag as black grouper on landing statistics and stock assessments.  (7) Development of statistically valid indices of abundance for important reef fish species in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (especially red grouper), including spatial and temporal variations in size distribution.  (8) Assessment of tag performance on reef fish species, mainly snappers and groupers. Characteristics examined should include shedding rate, effects on growth and survival, and effects of these characteristics on estimations of vital population parameters.  (9) Stock assessments to establish the status of major recreational and commercial species. Innovative methods are needed for stock assessments of aggregate species, including the effect of fishing on genetic structure and the incorporation of sex change for protogynous hermaphrodites into stock assessment models.  (10) Fishery-independent assessments of spawning aggregations of gag, scamp, yellowedge and other groupers, using hydroacoustic and underwater video technology.  d. Management of reef fish.  (1) Research in direct support of management, including catch-and-release mortalities by gear and depth, the value of limiting longlines to specific water depths (e.g., outside the 50&hyph;fathom (91.4&hyph;m) curve), and modifications (gear, techniques) to minimize bycatch.  (2) Evaluation of the use of reef fish marine reserves as an alternative or supplement to current fishery management measures and practices, especially in the South Atlantic. Of particular interest is Oculina Banks off the Atlantic Coast of Florida.  (3) Characterization and evaluation of the social and economic behavior of commercial and recreational fishermen, and how these characteristics change in response to management measures.  (4) Characterization and quantification of the biological, economic, and social impacts of the longline fishery for reef fish along the west coast of Florida. This should include the following:  (a) Catch-per-unit-effort of target and bycatch species, and biological parameters (e.g., size, sex, and reproductive state) by gear type, area, and season.  (b) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fishery.  (c) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize the bycatch of undersized and unwanted species, including sea turtles and marine mammals.  (d) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries.  4.     Coastal Herrings    .  Preliminary studies indicate that substantial stocks of coastal herrings occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most of the available data are generated from fishery-independent surveys conducted by NMFS and state fishery management agencies. Because of the size of these stocks, their importance as prey, and in some instances as predator species, their potential for development as commercial and recreational fisheries must be understood. General research needs include:  a. Collection, collation, and analysis of available fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data from state and Federal surveys, with emphasis on species and size composition, seasonal distribution patterns, biomass, bycatch, and environmental relationships. Emphasis should be given to species such as Spanish sardine that are important as prey to gamefish.  b. Description and quantification of predator-prey relationships between coastal herring species and carnivores such as mackerels, tunas, swordfish, billfish, sharks, bluefish, and others in high demand by commercial and recreational fisheries.  c. Design of innovative economic and social management approaches for the purse seine menhaden fishery, including, but not limited to, limited entry.  5.     Coastal Migratory Pelagic Fisheries    .  The commercial and recreational demand for migratory coastal pelagics has led to overfishing for certain species, including king and Spanish mackerel. Additionally, some are transboundary with Mexico and other countries and ultimately will demand international management attention. Current high priorities include:  a. Recruitment indices for king and Spanish mackerel, cobia, dolphin, and bluefish, primarily from fishery-independent data sources.  b. Assessment and management models for coastal pelagic resources that are dominated by single year classes, such as Spanish mackerel, dolphin, and bluefish.  c. Fishery-independent methods of assessing stock abundance of king and Spanish mackerel.   d. Improved catch statistics for all species in Mexican waters, with special emphasis on king mackerel; needed especially is length-frequency, life history and genetic information.  e. Information on populations of coastal pelagics overwintering off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, especially population size, age and movement patterns.  f. Basic biostatistical information on cobia and dolphin to develop age-length keys and maturation schedules for stock assessments.  g. Impact of bag limits on total catch and landings of king and Spanish mackerel.  h. Demand and supply functions for recreational and commercial fisheries for king mackerel in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Emphasis should be on changes in marginal values of producer and consumer surpluses, since the studies would be used in allocation frameworks where total values are not necessarily required.  6.     Groundfish and Estuarine Fishes      Substantial stocks of groundfish and estuarine species occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most of the database for assessments comes from studies conducted by NMFS and state fishery management agencies. Because of the historic and current size of these fish stocks, their importance as predator and prey species, and their current or potential use as commercial and recreational fisheries, more information on their biology and conservation is needed. General research needs are:  a. Red drum.  (1) Effects of sportfishing on red drum populations in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic. A specific need in the South Atlantic is increased sampling of nighttime fishing for red drum on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  (2) Size and age-structure of the offshore adult red drum stock in the Gulf of Mexico.  (3) Immigration and escapement of red drum from state waters into the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic.  (4) Life history parameters and stock structure for the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Research should include migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and comparisons of the inshore and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries. Specific research needs for Atlantic red drum are fecundity estimates, as a function of length and weight, and improved coastwide coverage for age-length keys.  (5) Catch-and-release mortality rates from inshore and nearshore waters, and fishing mortality rates in state territorial waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  b. Life history and stock structure for weakfish, menhaden, spot and croaker in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Research should include migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and comparisons of the inshore and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries.  c. Improved catch and effort statistics from recreational and commercial fisheries, including size and age structure of the catch, to develop production models.  d. Quantification and qualification of the bycatch in finfish trawl fisheries, such as the flounder and fly-net fisheries in the South Atlantic.  e. Determination of catch-and-release mortality rates for spotted seatrout from inshore and nearshore waters.  7.     Crabs and Lobsters    .  a. Monitoring of fecundity and sex/size frequencies for examination of spawning potential in relation to overfishing criteria for stone crab and spiny lobster.  b. Development of recruitment indices, and population assessment and management models for stone crab and spiny lobster.  c. Determination of the relationship between the reproductive cycle characteristics of spiny lobster in Florida and the Caribbean.  8.     Sea Turtle Conservation.      The conservation of endangered and threatened sea turtles in the Southeast Region continues to be a high priority. Specific needs include:  a. Distribution, abundance and size composition of sea turtles in inshore waters, especially where these turtles may be affected by inshore fisheries.  b. Turtle excluder device (TED) modifications or designs to exclude adult leatherback sea turtles. The area of special concern is off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  c. TED designs and modifications for use in small inshore shrimp trawls. Especially needed is research on shrimp retention and on the effectiveness of TEDs operating in areas with debris.   d. Sea turtle incidental catch in fisheries other than the shrimp fishery.  e. Evaluation of the utility of turtle stranding data as an indication of fishery-caused mortality.  9.     General    .   There are many areas of research that need to be addressed for improved understanding and management of fishery resources. These include methods for data collection, management, analysis, and for better conservation. Examples of high priority research needs include:  a. Design and critical analysis of a data collection system that may involve permits, logbooks, trip interviews, dealer reporting or other innovative methods. The system design should be applicable across the entire range of species that may be pursued throughout the Gulf and South Atlantic, and should address economic, biological and social data needs.  b. Assessment of the changes in recreational and commercial values that have resulted from past management practices for red drum, shrimp, mackerels and reef fish.  c. Development of improved methods and procedures for technology transfer, and education of constituency groups on fishery management and conservation programs. Of special importance are programs concerned with controlled access and introduction of conservation gear.  d. Compilation of baseline socio-demographic data for describing the social and cultural framework of managed fisheries. B. Priority in program emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest probability of recovering, maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment success; and generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries. Projects will be evaluated as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through short- and long-term research efforts, with consideration given to the magnitude of the eventual economic benefits that may be realized.  C. Further information on current Federal programs that address the above-listed priorities may be obtained from the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ).      XIII. Evaluation Criteria.      Successful applicants generally will be recommended within 210 days from the date of publication of this notice. The earliest start date of awards will be about 90 days after each project is selected and after all NMFS/applicant negotiations of cooperative activities have been completed (The earliest start date of awards will be about 300 days after the date of publication of this notice). Applicants should consider this selection and processing time in developing requested start dates for their applications. Proposed projects will be evaluated and ranked as follows:  1. Cooperatively developed applications that propose activities of two or more qualified applicants to address important fishery conservation and management issues or problems identified in the Areas of Emphasis for this solicitation may be evaluated as a group by NMFS. If selected for funding, individual cooperative awards may be made to each individual applicant. Application procedures for this type of proposal are also included in the FY 1995 MARFIN Application Package.  2. Unless otherwise specified by statute, in reviewing applications for cooperative agreements, including those that include consultants and contracts, NOAA will make a determination regarding the following:  a. Is the involvement of the applicant necessary to the conduct of the project and the accomplishment of its goals and objectives?  b. Is the proposed allocation of the applicant's time reasonable and commensurate with the applicant's involvement in the project?  c. Are the proposed costs for the applicant's involvement in the project reasonable and commensurate with the benefits to be derived from the applicant's participation?  d. Is the project proposal substantial in character and design?  3. Applications meeting the above requirements will be forwarded for technical evaluation. Applicants submitting applications not meeting the above requirements will be notified. Evaluations normally will involve experts from non-NOAA, as well as NOAA organizations. All comments submitted to NMFS will be taken into consideration in the technical evaluation of projects. NMFS will provide point scores on proposals, based on the following evaluation criteria:  a. Does the proposal have a clearly stated goal(s) with associated objectives that meet the needs outlined in the Project Narrative? (30 points)  b. Does the proposal clearly identify and describe, in the Project Outline and Statement of Work, scientifically valid methodologies and analytical procedures that will adequately address project goals and objectives? (30 points)  c. Do the principal investigators provide a scientifically realistic timetable to enable full accomplishment of all aspects of the Statements of Work? (20 points)  d. Do the principal investigators define how they will maintain stewardship of the project performance, finances, cooperative relationships and reporting requirements for the proposal? (10 points)  e. Are the proposed costs appropriate for the scope of work proposed? (10 points)      XIV. Selection Procedures.      All applications will be ranked by a NMFS scientific panel into two groups: (a) Recommended, and (b) Not Recommended. Proposals ranked as Not Recommended will not be given further consideration for selection and funding. All rankings will be presented to a panel of non-NOAA fishery experts, who will individually consider the significance of the problem addressed in each project proposal, the technical evaluation, and need for funding. These panel members will provide individual recommendations to NMFS on each proposal classified as Recommended or Not Recommended.  The non-NOAA panel members' individual comments, recommendations and evaluations, and recommendations of the NMFS scientific panel and NMFS Southeast Program Officer will be considered by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director). The Regional Director, in consultation with the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, will: (a) Determine which projects do not substantially duplicate other projects that are currently funded by NOAA or are approved for funding by other Federal offices, and recommend the projects to be funded. The exact amount of funds awarded, the final scope of activities, the project duration, and specific NMFS cooperative involvement with the activities of each project will be determined in pre-award negotiations between the applicant, the NOAA Grants Office, and the NMFS Program Staff. Projects must not be initiated by recipients until a signed award is received from the NOAA Grants Office. For project periods of more than 1 year, funds for subsequent budget periods may be provided if initial project tasks are satisfactorily completed and after NMFS has received MARFIN funds for subsequent periods.  NMFS will make project applications available for review as follows:  A.     Public Review and Comment     Applications may be inspected at the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES     and     DATES    ).  B.     Consultation with Members of the Fishing Industry, Management Agencies, Environmental Organizations, and Academic Institutions     NMFS shall, at its discretion, request comments from members of the fishing and associated industries, groups, organizations and institutions who have knowledge in the subject matter of a project or who would be affected by a project.  C.     Consultation with Government Agencies     Applications will be reviewed by the NMFS Southeast Region Program Office in consultation with the NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center and Southeast Operations Directors, including appropriate operations and laboratory personnel, the NOAA Grants Officer and, as appropriate, DOC bureaus and other Federal agencies.

Applications may be inspected at the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ) from September 30, 1994 through October 3, 1994.         </DATE> <ADDRESS>  ADDRESSES:     Send applications to: Ellie Roche, Competitive Programs Manager, Cooperative Programs Division, Southeast Regional Office, National Marine Fisheries Service, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702.         </ADDRESS>    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Ellie Roche, 813&hyph;893&hyph;3720.           <SUPPLEM>  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           I. Authority.      The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) is authorized under 15 U.S.C. 713c&hyph;3(d) to enter into cooperative agreements for research and development addressed to all aspects of U.S. fisheries.       II. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA).       This program is described in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under program number 11.433, Marine Fisheries Initiative.      III. Program Description.      MARFIN is a competitive Federal grant program that promotes and endorses programs that seek to optimize economic and social benefits from marine fishery resources through cooperative efforts that involve the best research and management talents to accomplish priority activities. Preference is given to selecting and funding applications for project grants that provide an opportunity for cooperative NMFS/applicant efforts and for multiple cooperating applicants/NMFS efforts with up to 3-year time horizons. Projects funded under MARFIN are focused into cooperative efforts that provide clear answers for fishery needs covered by the NMFS Strategic Plan, available from the Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ), particularly those goals relating to rebuilding overfished marine fisheries, maintaining currently productive fisheries, and integrating conservation of protected species and fisheries management.  Applications from multiple cooperating applicants that address conservation and management needs over a wide range of a fishery or fishery organism are encouraged. Emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest probability of recovering, maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment success; and/or generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries. Projects will be evaluated as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through both short-term and long-term research efforts, with consideration of the magnitude of the eventual economic or social benefits that may be realized. Short-term projects that may yield more immediate benefits, and projects yielding longer-term benefits will receive equal consideration.      IV. Funding Availability.      This solicitation announces that funding of approximately $1.25 million may be available in FY 1995 pending Congressional appropriation. MARFIN financial assistance started in FY 1986, and for FY 1986 through FY 1994, awards totaled about $15.5 million for financial assistance to conduct research for fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico and off the South Atlantic states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There is no guarantee that sufficient funds will be available to make awards for all approved projects.  Project proposals accepted for funding for a project period over 1 year that include multiple project components or severable tasks to be funded each budget period will not compete for funding in subsequent budget periods within the approved project period. However, funding for subsequent project components is contingent upon the availability of funds from Congress and satisfactory performance, and will be at the sole discretion of the agency. Publication of this notice does not obligate NMFS to award any specific cooperative agreement or to obligate all or any parts of the available funds.      V. Matching Requirements.      Applications must reflect the total budget necessary to accomplish the project, including contributions and/or donations. Cost-sharing is not required for the MARFIN program. However, cost-sharing is encouraged, and in case of a tie in considering proposals for funding, cost-sharing may affect the final decision. The appropriateness of all cost-sharing will be determined on the basis of guidance provided in applicable Federal cost principles. If an applicant chooses to cost-share, and if that application is selected for funding, the applicant will be bound by the percentage of the cost share reflected in the cooperative agreement award.  The non-Federal share may include funds received from private sources or from state or local governments, or the value of in-kind contributions by the applicant or third parties. Federal funds may not be used to meet the non-Federal share of matching funds, except as provided by Federal statute. In-kind contributions may be in the form of, but are not limited to, personal services rendered in carrying out functions related to the project, and use of real or personal property owned by others (for which consideration is not required) in carrying out the projects.  The total cost of a project begins on the effective date of a cooperative agreement between the applicant and the NOAA Grants Officer and ends on the date specified in the award. Accordingly, time expended and costs incurred in either the development of a project or the financial assistance application, or in any subsequent discussions or negotiations prior to the award, are neither reimbursable nor recognizable as part of the recipient's cost share.      VI. Type of Funding Instrument.      The cooperative agreement has been determined to be the appropriate funding instrument. NMFS is substantially involved in developing program research priorities, conducting cooperative activities with recipients, and evaluating the performance of recipients for effectiveness in meeting national and regional goals for fishery research in the southeastern United States.      VII. Eligibility Criteria.      1. Applications for cooperative agreements for MARFIN projects may be made, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this notice, by:  a. Any individual who is a citizen or national of the United States;  b. Any corporation, partnership, or other entity, non-profit or otherwise, if such entity is a citizen of the United States within the meaning of section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended (46 app. U.S.C. 802).  c. Colleges and universities, and game and fish departments of the several states.  2. NOAA employees, including full-time, part-time, and intermittent personnel (or their immediate families), and NOAA offices or centers are not eligible to submit an application under this solicitation, or aid in the preparation of an application during the 60-day solicitation period, except to provide information about the MARFIN program and the priorities and procedures included in this solicitation. However, NOAA employees are permitted to provide information about ongoing and planned NOAA programs and activities that may have implication for an application. Potential applicants are encouraged to contact Ms. Ellie Roche at the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ) for information on NOAA programs. Documents available from that office that may be useful to the applicant include:  a. A Cooperative Reef Fish Research Program for the Gulf of Mexico.  b. A Cooperative Bycatch Research Plan for the Southeast Region.  c. Strategic Plan of the National Marine Fisheries Service.  d. National Status of Stocks Report.  e. Various fishery management plans and plan amendments produced by the Councils and the Commissions.  f. Report of a Workshop on Grouper Reproduction, November 1993.      VIII. Award Period.      The award period for the project may be made for more than one year consisting of one, two, or three budget periods which correspond to the funding for the proposed project components. The award period will depend upon the duration of funding requested by the applicant in the Application for Federal Assistance, the decision of the NMFS selecting official on the amount of funding, the results of post-selection negotiations between the applicant and NOAA officials, and preaward review of the application by NOAA and Department of Commerce (DOC) officials. Normally, each project budget period may be no more than 18 months in duration. NOAA policy limits the total duration of a project to about 3 years.       IX. Indirect Costs.      The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in an application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award, or 25 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less. Institutions with indirect cost rates above 25 percent may use the amount above the 25&hyph;percent level as part of the non-Federal share. A copy of the current, approved, negotiated Indirect Cost Agreement with the Federal government must be included with the application.      X. Profit or Fees.      Profit or management fees paid to for-profit or commercial organization grantees are allowable at the discretion of NOAA. However, they shall not exceed 7 percent of the total estimated direct costs. There must be no profit or fees to the recipient in any overhead charge. Payment of fees or profit is based on successful completion of project objectives.      XI. Application Forms and Kit.      Before submitting an application under this program, applicants should contact the NMFS Southeast Regional Office for a copy of this solicitation's MARFIN Application Package (see     ADDRESSES    ).  Applications for project funding under this program must be complete and be in accordance with instructions in the MARFIN Application Package. They must identify the principal participants and include copies of any agreements describing the specific tasks to be performed by participants. Project applications should give a clear presentation of the proposed work, the methods for carrying out the project, its relevance to managing and enhancing the use of Gulf of Mexico and/or South Atlantic fishery resources, and cost estimates as they relate to specific aspects of the project. Budgets must include a detailed breakdown, by category of expenditures, with appropriate justification for both the Federal and non-Federal shares. Applicants should not assume prior knowledge on the part of NMFS as to the relative merits of the project described in the application. Applications are not to be bound in any manner and should be one-sided. All incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant. Three copies (one original and two copies) of each application are required, and should be submitted to the NMFS Southeast Regional Office, Cooperative Programs Division (see     ADDRESSES    ).      XII. Project Funding Priorities.      A. Proposals for FY 1995 should exhibit familiarity with related work that is completed or ongoing. Where appropriate, proposals should be multidisciplinary. Coordinated efforts involving multiple institutions or persons are encouraged. The areas of special emphasis are listed below, but proposals in other areas will be considered on a funds-available basis.  In addition to referencing specific area(s) of special interest as listed below, proposals should state whether the research will apply to the Gulf of Mexico only, the South Atlantic only, or to both areas. Successful applicants may be required to collect and manage data in accordance with standardized procedures and formats approved by NMFS, and to participate with NMFS in specific cooperative activities that will be determined by consultations between NMFS and successful applicants before project grants are awarded. Recipients of financial assistance for projects with multiple project periods must include funding in their applications for travel expenses for the principal investigator to participate in one annual project review and evaluation meeting in St. Petersburg, FL. All recipients of financial assistance under this program shall include funding in their applications for the principal investigator to participate in an annual MARFIN Conference at the completion of the project.  Research needs identified in fishery management plans (FMPs) and amendments prepared by the Gulf and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and the Gulf and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commissions (Commissions) are included. For availability of these documents, contact the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ). Areas of special emphasis for FY 1995 include:  1.     Shrimp Trawler Bycatch    .  Studies are needed to contribute to the regional shrimp trawler bycatch program being conducted by NMFS in cooperation with state fishery management agencies, commercial and recreational fishing organizations and interests, environmental organizations, universities, Councils, and Commissions. Specific guidance and research requirements are contained in the Regional Bycatch Plan prepared through the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation. In particular, the studies should address:  a. Data collection and analyses to expand and update current bycatch estimates temporally and spatially from offshore, nearshore, and inshore waters, emphasizing areas of greatest shrimping impact. Sampling effort should include estimates of numbers, weight, and age structure of the associated bycatch complex.  b. Assessments of the status and condition of fish stocks significantly impacted by shrimp trawler bycatch, with emphasis given to overfished species under the jurisdiction of the Councils.  c. Identification, development, and evaluation of gear, non- gear and tactical fishing options to reduce bycatch.  d. Improved methods for communicating with and improving technology and information transfer to the shrimp industry.  e. Social and economic impacts of management options to reduce shrimp fishery bycatch.   2.     Highly Migratory Pelagic Fisheries    .  a.     Longline Fisheries, Including Bycatch    .  A number of pelagic longline fisheries exist in the Gulf and South Atlantic, targeting highly migratory species such as tunas, some sharks, and swordfish. These fisheries have evolved rapidly over the last decade, with increases in fishing effort and changes in fishing gear and tactics. These changes need to be characterized and their effects quantified. High priority areas include:  (1) Characterization of specific longline fisheries, including targeted species, stock identification, catch-per-unit-effort of bycatch, and biological parameters (e.g., sex ratios and reproductive state) by gear type, area and season.  (2) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fisheries.  (3) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize bycatch of undersized and unwanted species, including sea turtles and marine mammals.  (4) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries, including biological, social, and economic factors and effects.   (5) Dependence of vessels and persons engaged in pelagic longlining on other fisheries. Particular emphasis should be placed on the extent to which the capital and/or labor engages in other fisheries at particular times of the year and reasons for this switching behavior.  b.     Sharks    .  A Secretarial FMP for sharks has been developed that identifies a number of research needs, including:  (1) Characterization of the commercial and recreational fisheries from historical and current databases. Emphasis should be on species composition, bycatch, stock identification, size, sex ratios and catch-per-unit-effort by season, area, and gear type.  (2) Collection and analysis of basic biological data on movements, habitats, growth rates, mortality rates, age structure and reproduction parameters. These data are of particular importance for blacktip and sandbar sharks. Information on the relationship of sandbar sharks to water depth and determination of the southern boundary of its range are specifically needed.  (3) Determination of baseline cost and returns for commercial fisheries that land sharks, and estimation of demand curves for shark products and recreational shark fisheries.   (4) Development of species profiles and stock assessments for sharks taken in significant quantities by commercial and recreational fishers, and as bycatch in other fisheries. Assessments can be species-specific or for species groups, following those identified in the Atlantic Sharks FMP.  (5) Identification of coastal sharks, using laboratory methodologies.  (6) Development of a more precise and accurate estimate of the recreational shark fishery. Proposals in this area must demonstrate a knowledge of the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistical Survey (MRFSS), and should indicate a willingness to participate directly in the MRFSS through add-on surveys or enhancement of current surveys.  (7) Development of fishery-independent abundance indices.  3.     Reef Fish    .  A number of species within the reef fish complex are showing signs of being overfished, either by directed efforts or as bycatch in other fisheries. The ecology of reef fish makes them vulnerable to overfishing because they tend to concentrate over specific types of habitats with patchy distribution. This behavior pattern can make traditional fishery statistics misleading. Priority research areas include:  a. Collection of basic biological data for species in commercially and recreationally important fisheries.  (1) Age and growth of reef fish.  (a) Description of age and growth patterns (especially red snapper, gray triggerfish and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic).  (b) Development of annual age-length keys for vermilion snapper in the northern Gulf and west coast central Florida, and for red grouper in the Gulf, along with new growth models for red grouper that include possible density-dependent effects, as well as environmental effects.  (2) Reproduction studies of reef fish.  (a) Maturity schedules and fecundity of commercially and recreationally important reef fish (especially gray triggerfish and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico).  (b) Detailed histological studies of red snapper to characterize the actual reproductive contribution of females, by age.  (c) Identification and characterization of spawning aggregations by species, areas, and seasons. Information is especially needed on changes in sex ratios for gag grouper caused by fishing on spawning aggregations.  (d) Reproductive studies covering extensive geographic distributions along the southeastern U.S. coast (North Carolina through the Florida Keys). Samples should be obtained from recreational (private and headboats) and commercial vessels.  (e) Reproductive biology of gag, red grouper and other grouper species. Of particular importance are evaluation of sperm limitation, determination of the proximal causes of sex change (whether behavioral or developmental), determination of the annual periodicity of sex-change induction and age-specific spawning frequency, and other research identified in the recommendations of the workshop on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November 1993.  (3) Recruitment of reef fish.  (a) Source of recruitment in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic waters (especially amberjack and vermilion snapper), and possible Caribbean source for Florida Keys snapper and grouper.  (b) Annual estimation of the absolute or relative recruitment of juvenile gag to the seagrass beds off the west coast of Florida and to similar estuarine nursery habitats along the South Atlantic Bight; development of an index of juvenile gag recruitment for the South Atlantic based on historical databases and/or field studies.  (c) Evaluation of the contribution of live-bottom habitat to reef fish recruitment   (4) Stock structure of reef fish.  (a) Movement and migration patterns of commercially and recreationally valuable reef fish species (especially gag and greater amberjack in the South Atlantic).  (b) Techniques to allow field separation of lesser amberjack, almaco jack, and banded rudderfish from greater amberjack to facilitate accurate reporting of catch.  (c) Stock structure of gag and wreckfish in the South Atlantic, and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic.  (d) Use of parasitological surveys in species such as wreckfish and white grunt to determine stock structure.  b. Behavioral studies of reef fish.  (1) Description of the behavior of age&hyph;0 and age&hyph;1 red snapper.  (2) Effects of fishing on reproductive behavior, in formation of aggregations and disruption of existing aggregations.  c. Population assessment of reef fish.  (1) Effect of reproductive mode and sex change (protogynous hermaphroditism) on population size and characteristics, with reference to sizes of fish exploited in the fisheries and the significance to proper management.  (2) Design of sampling routines to provide a production-style aging program representative of the reef fish fishery. Effective dock-side sampling programs, especially for groupers, are needed over a wide geographic range to collect information on reproductive state, size, age, and sex. These research needs are discussed in the report of the workshop on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November 1993.  (3) Source and quantification of natural and human-induced mortalities.   (4) Determination of the habitat and limiting factors for important reef fish resources (such as snappers in the Gulf of Mexico). Information is also needed on the importance of human-created and natural channels for controlling stock sizes and growth rates of snappers and groupers.  (5) Description of habitat and fish populations in the deep reef community and the prey distributions supporting the community.  (6) Evaluation of the effect of misidentifying gag as black grouper on landing statistics and stock assessments.  (7) Development of statistically valid indices of abundance for important reef fish species in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (especially red grouper), including spatial and temporal variations in size distribution.  (8) Assessment of tag performance on reef fish species, mainly snappers and groupers. Characteristics examined should include shedding rate, effects on growth and survival, and effects of these characteristics on estimations of vital population parameters.  (9) Stock assessments to establish the status of major recreational and commercial species. Innovative methods are needed for stock assessments of aggregate species, including the effect of fishing on genetic structure and the incorporation of sex change for protogynous hermaphrodites into stock assessment models.  (10) Fishery-independent assessments of spawning aggregations of gag, scamp, yellowedge and other groupers, using hydroacoustic and underwater video technology.  d. Management of reef fish.  (1) Research in direct support of management, including catch-and-release mortalities by gear and depth, the value of limiting longlines to specific water depths (e.g., outside the 50&hyph;fathom (91.4&hyph;m) curve), and modifications (gear, techniques) to minimize bycatch.  (2) Evaluation of the use of reef fish marine reserves as an alternative or supplement to current fishery management measures and practices, especially in the South Atlantic. Of particular interest is Oculina Banks off the Atlantic Coast of Florida.  (3) Characterization and evaluation of the social and economic behavior of commercial and recreational fishermen, and how these characteristics change in response to management measures.  (4) Characterization and quantification of the biological, economic, and social impacts of the longline fishery for reef fish along the west coast of Florida. This should include the following:  (a) Catch-per-unit-effort of target and bycatch species, and biological parameters (e.g., size, sex, and reproductive state) by gear type, area, and season.  (b) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fishery.  (c) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize the bycatch of undersized and unwanted species, including sea turtles and marine mammals.  (d) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries.  4.     Coastal Herrings    .  Preliminary studies indicate that substantial stocks of coastal herrings occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most of the available data are generated from fishery-independent surveys conducted by NMFS and state fishery management agencies. Because of the size of these stocks, their importance as prey, and in some instances as predator species, their potential for development as commercial and recreational fisheries must be understood. General research needs include:  a. Collection, collation, and analysis of available fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data from state and Federal surveys, with emphasis on species and size composition, seasonal distribution patterns, biomass, bycatch, and environmental relationships. Emphasis should be given to species such as Spanish sardine that are important as prey to gamefish.  b. Description and quantification of predator-prey relationships between coastal herring species and carnivores such as mackerels, tunas, swordfish, billfish, sharks, bluefish, and others in high demand by commercial and recreational fisheries.  c. Design of innovative economic and social management approaches for the purse seine menhaden fishery, including, but not limited to, limited entry.  5.     Coastal Migratory Pelagic Fisheries    .  The commercial and recreational demand for migratory coastal pelagics has led to overfishing for certain species, including king and Spanish mackerel. Additionally, some are transboundary with Mexico and other countries and ultimately will demand international management attention. Current high priorities include:  a. Recruitment indices for king and Spanish mackerel, cobia, dolphin, and bluefish, primarily from fishery-independent data sources.  b. Assessment and management models for coastal pelagic resources that are dominated by single year classes, such as Spanish mackerel, dolphin, and bluefish.  c. Fishery-independent methods of assessing stock abundance of king and Spanish mackerel.   d. Improved catch statistics for all species in Mexican waters, with special emphasis on king mackerel; needed especially is length-frequency, life history and genetic information.  e. Information on populations of coastal pelagics overwintering off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, especially population size, age and movement patterns.  f. Basic biostatistical information on cobia and dolphin to develop age-length keys and maturation schedules for stock assessments.  g. Impact of bag limits on total catch and landings of king and Spanish mackerel.  h. Demand and supply functions for recreational and commercial fisheries for king mackerel in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Emphasis should be on changes in marginal values of producer and consumer surpluses, since the studies would be used in allocation frameworks where total values are not necessarily required.  6.     Groundfish and Estuarine Fishes      Substantial stocks of groundfish and estuarine species occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most of the database for assessments comes from studies conducted by NMFS and state fishery management agencies. Because of the historic and current size of these fish stocks, their importance as predator and prey species, and their current or potential use as commercial and recreational fisheries, more information on their biology and conservation is needed. General research needs are:  a. Red drum.  (1) Effects of sportfishing on red drum populations in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic. A specific need in the South Atlantic is increased sampling of nighttime fishing for red drum on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  (2) Size and age-structure of the offshore adult red drum stock in the Gulf of Mexico.  (3) Immigration and escapement of red drum from state waters into the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic.  (4) Life history parameters and stock structure for the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Research should include migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and comparisons of the inshore and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries. Specific research needs for Atlantic red drum are fecundity estimates, as a function of length and weight, and improved coastwide coverage for age-length keys.  (5) Catch-and-release mortality rates from inshore and nearshore waters, and fishing mortality rates in state territorial waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  b. Life history and stock structure for weakfish, menhaden, spot and croaker in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Research should include migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and comparisons of the inshore and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries.  c. Improved catch and effort statistics from recreational and commercial fisheries, including size and age structure of the catch, to develop production models.  d. Quantification and qualification of the bycatch in finfish trawl fisheries, such as the flounder and fly-net fisheries in the South Atlantic.  e. Determination of catch-and-release mortality rates for spotted seatrout from inshore and nearshore waters.  7.     Crabs and Lobsters    .  a. Monitoring of fecundity and sex/size frequencies for examination of spawning potential in relation to overfishing criteria for stone crab and spiny lobster.  b. Development of recruitment indices, and population assessment and management models for stone crab and spiny lobster.  c. Determination of the relationship between the reproductive cycle characteristics of spiny lobster in Florida and the Caribbean.  8.     Sea Turtle Conservation.      The conservation of endangered and threatened sea turtles in the Southeast Region continues to be a high priority. Specific needs include:  a. Distribution, abundance and size composition of sea turtles in inshore waters, especially where these turtles may be affected by inshore fisheries.  b. Turtle excluder device (TED) modifications or designs to exclude adult leatherback sea turtles. The area of special concern is off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.  c. TED designs and modifications for use in small inshore shrimp trawls. Especially needed is research on shrimp retention and on the effectiveness of TEDs operating in areas with debris.   d. Sea turtle incidental catch in fisheries other than the shrimp fishery.  e. Evaluation of the utility of turtle stranding data as an indication of fishery-caused mortality.  9.     General    .   There are many areas of research that need to be addressed for improved understanding and management of fishery resources. These include methods for data collection, management, analysis, and for better conservation. Examples of high priority research needs include:  a. Design and critical analysis of a data collection system that may involve permits, logbooks, trip interviews, dealer reporting or other innovative methods. The system design should be applicable across the entire range of species that may be pursued throughout the Gulf and South Atlantic, and should address economic, biological and social data needs.  b. Assessment of the changes in recreational and commercial values that have resulted from past management practices for red drum, shrimp, mackerels and reef fish.  c. Development of improved methods and procedures for technology transfer, and education of constituency groups on fishery management and conservation programs. Of special importance are programs concerned with controlled access and introduction of conservation gear.  d. Compilation of baseline socio-demographic data for describing the social and cultural framework of managed fisheries. B. Priority in program emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest probability of recovering, maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment success; and generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries. Projects will be evaluated as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through short- and long-term research efforts, with consideration given to the magnitude of the eventual economic benefits that may be realized.  C. Further information on current Federal programs that address the above-listed priorities may be obtained from the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES    ).      XIII. Evaluation Criteria.      Successful applicants generally will be recommended within 210 days from the date of publication of this notice. The earliest start date of awards will be about 90 days after each project is selected and after all NMFS/applicant negotiations of cooperative activities have been completed (The earliest start date of awards will be about 300 days after the date of publication of this notice). Applicants should consider this selection and processing time in developing requested start dates for their applications. Proposed projects will be evaluated and ranked as follows:  1. Cooperatively developed applications that propose activities of two or more qualified applicants to address important fishery conservation and management issues or problems identified in the Areas of Emphasis for this solicitation may be evaluated as a group by NMFS. If selected for funding, individual cooperative awards may be made to each individual applicant. Application procedures for this type of proposal are also included in the FY 1995 MARFIN Application Package.  2. Unless otherwise specified by statute, in reviewing applications for cooperative agreements, including those that include consultants and contracts, NOAA will make a determination regarding the following:  a. Is the involvement of the applicant necessary to the conduct of the project and the accomplishment of its goals and objectives?  b. Is the proposed allocation of the applicant's time reasonable and commensurate with the applicant's involvement in the project?  c. Are the proposed costs for the applicant's involvement in the project reasonable and commensurate with the benefits to be derived from the applicant's participation?  d. Is the project proposal substantial in character and design?  3. Applications meeting the above requirements will be forwarded for technical evaluation. Applicants submitting applications not meeting the above requirements will be notified. Evaluations normally will involve experts from non-NOAA, as well as NOAA organizations. All comments submitted to NMFS will be taken into consideration in the technical evaluation of projects. NMFS will provide point scores on proposals, based on the following evaluation criteria:  a. Does the proposal have a clearly stated goal(s) with associated objectives that meet the needs outlined in the Project Narrative? (30 points)  b.

Are the proposed costs appropriate for the scope of work proposed? (10 points)      XIV. Selection Procedures.      All applications will be ranked by a NMFS scientific panel into two groups: (a) Recommended, and (b) Not Recommended. Proposals ranked as Not Recommended will not be given further consideration for selection and funding. All rankings will be presented to a panel of non-NOAA fishery experts, who will individually consider the significance of the problem addressed in each project proposal, the technical evaluation, and need for funding. These panel members will provide individual recommendations to NMFS on each proposal classified as Recommended or Not Recommended.  The non-NOAA panel members' individual comments, recommendations and evaluations, and recommendations of the NMFS scientific panel and NMFS Southeast Program Officer will be considered by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director). The Regional Director, in consultation with the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, will: (a) Determine which projects do not substantially duplicate other projects that are currently funded by NOAA or are approved for funding by other Federal offices, and recommend the projects to be funded. The exact amount of funds awarded, the final scope of activities, the project duration, and specific NMFS cooperative involvement with the activities of each project will be determined in pre-award negotiations between the applicant, the NOAA Grants Office, and the NMFS Program Staff. Projects must not be initiated by recipients until a signed award is received from the NOAA Grants Office. For project periods of more than 1 year, funds for subsequent budget periods may be provided if initial project tasks are satisfactorily completed and after NMFS has received MARFIN funds for subsequent periods.  NMFS will make project applications available for review as follows:  A.     Public Review and Comment     Applications may be inspected at the NMFS Southeast Regional Office (see     ADDRESSES     and     DATES    ).  B.     Consultation with Members of the Fishing Industry, Management Agencies, Environmental Organizations, and Academic Institutions     NMFS shall, at its discretion, request comments from members of the fishing and associated industries, groups, organizations and institutions who have knowledge in the subject matter of a project or who would be affected by a project.

headline: Solicitation and Acceptance of Donations
text:   SUMMARY:     The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) is announcing that it is soliciting cash donations and donations of goods and services from private sector companies, foundations, and individuals in order to leverage federally appropriated resources in carrying out its national service program.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The Corporation is a new government corporation that encompasses the work and staff of two previously existing federal agencies, the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity for those who make a substantial commitment to service.          The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety of programs operated by grantees, the National Civilian Community Corps, and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program. The Corporation will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education called Learn and Serve America, and operate the senior volunteers programs previously supported by ACTION. Some of the national service programs will be operating this summer, and most of the others will be operational by this fall.    Purusant to the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (the Act), the Corporation may ``solicit, accept, hold, administer, use, and dispose of, in furtherance of [the purposes of national service], donations of any money, or property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, received by gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise.'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A). Such donations ``shall be considered to be a gift, devise, or bequest to, or for the use of, the United States,'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(B), and therefore may be allowable as a charitable tax deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 170. The Corporation may also ``solicit and accept the voluntary services of individuals'' to assist the Corporation in carrying out the national service program. 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A).    The Corporation is striving to build innovative public/private partnerships that support national and community service programs throughout the country. The Corporation's primary goal is to foster strategic linkages between private sector companies, foundations, government agencies, and community service organizations, in order to multiply their combined abilities to address shared community problems. To this end, the Corporation seeks to leverage its federally appropriated resources with donations of goods and services form private sector companies, foundations, and individuals.

The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity for those who make a substantial commitment to service.          The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety of programs operated by grantees, the National Civilian Community Corps, and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program. The Corporation will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education called Learn and Serve America, and operate the senior volunteers programs previously supported by ACTION. Some of the national service programs will be operating this summer, and most of the others will be operational by this fall.    Purusant to the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (the Act), the Corporation may ``solicit, accept, hold, administer, use, and dispose of, in furtherance of [the purposes of national service], donations of any money, or property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, received by gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise.'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A). Such donations ``shall be considered to be a gift, devise, or bequest to, or for the use of, the United States,'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(B), and therefore may be allowable as a charitable tax deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 170. The Corporation may also ``solicit and accept the voluntary services of individuals'' to assist the Corporation in carrying out the national service program. 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A).

headline: Golden Field Office; Federal Assistance Award to Sacramento Municipal Utility District
text:   SUMMARY:     The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District for the implementation of utility, grid-connected photovoltaic systems.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     DOE has evaluated, in accordance with the DOE Federal Assistance Regulations, 10 CFR 600.14, the unsolicited proposal entitled ``Sustained Utility Implementation of Photovoltaics'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal be accepted for support without further competition in accordance with &sect;600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations.        This award involves cost sharing on the hardware, installation and evaluation of utility, grid-connected photovoltaic systems for residential, commercial/utility sized (substation), and building-integrated applications. Sacramento Municipal Utility Districts' (SMUD) ``sustained orderly development'' effort to advance the commercialization of grid-connected photovoltaics plans to install about 900 kW of grid-connected PV systems. This will include about 100 residential ``PV Pioneer'' systems, several systems of the commercial/utility size, and building-integrated applications such as PV integrated as architectural building components and demand-side management applications.    The phase I activities include procurement activities, including issuance of the RFP, bids, proposal evaluations, negotiations and SMUD board approval. Phase II activities include the installation, monitoring and evaluation of PV systems.    This project represents a unique opportunity to evaluate large-scale, distributed, utility grid-connected PV applications; implement a substantial hardware procurement; and support the commercialization of grid-connected photovoltaics. SMUD has a high probability of achieving the project objectives based on past projects, a ``large'' service area for the implementation of grid-connected applications and community commitment to the adoption of PV technology. SMUD's resources and commitment to extending the utility PV collaborative process and promoting cooperative ventures to accelerate the commercialization of utility PV applications should provide a basis for the successful implementation.    The program cost is estimated to be $10,800,000 total, with the DOE share being $1,600,000 or 14.8%. The proposed DOE funding for FY 94 is $500,000 and for FY 95 is $1,100,000.

headline: Proposed Consent Order with Murphy Oil Corporation, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and Murphy Exploration &amp; Production Company
text:   SUMMARY:     The Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) announces   a proposed Consent Order between the Department of Energy (DOE) and Murphy Oil Corporation, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and Murphy Exploration &amp; Production Company (Murphy). The agreement proposes to resolve matters relating to Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations for the period January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981. If this Consent Order is approved, Murphy will pay $10,700,000.00 to DOE. To distribute these monies, DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals will be petitioned to implement Special Refund Procedures pursuant to 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V, in which proceedings any persons who claim to have suffered injury from the alleged overcharges would have the opportunity to submit claims for payment.         Pursuant to 10 CFR &sect;205.199J, ERA will receive written comments on the proposed Consent Order and will consider all comments received from the public in determining whether to accept the settlement and issue a final Order, renegotiate the agreement and issue a modified agreement as a final Order, or reject the settlement. DOE's final decision will be published in the     Federal Register    , along with an analysis of significant written comments in response to this notice, as well as any other considerations that were relevant to the final decision.         SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Murphy is a petroleum refiner and a producer subject to the audit jurisdiction of ERA to determine compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. During the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981, Murphy engaged in, among other things, the production, sale and refining of crude oil. On February 9, 1987, Murphy and DOE entered into a Consent Order (hereinafter the 1987 Consent Order) that settled, with certain specific exceptions, all claims and disputes against Murphy by DOE for the period January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981. The 1987 Consent Order specifically excepted, among other things, issues or claims then pending or arising out of first sales of crude oil produced and sold from properties operated by Murphy.         As a result of DOE's investigation of Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December 15, 1986. On June 17, 1992, DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) modified the PRO and issued it as a Remedial Order (RO) to Murphy.     Murphy Oil Corp    ., 22 DOE &para; 83,005 (1992). The RO finds Murphy liable to make restitution of $13,366,664.60, plus interest to the date of restitution, for violations of the regulations applicable to first sales of domestic crude oil (10 CFR &sect;&sect;212.72&hyph;212.74), the regulations exempting from the price rules the sale of crude oil produced from ``stripper well'' properties (10 CFR &sect;&sect;210.32 and 212.54), and the normal business practices rule (10 CFR &sect;210.62(c)) in connection with Murphy's first sales of crude oil during the period September 1973 through December 1979. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the RO would total $67.6 million through June 1994. Murphy appealed that RO to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).     The RO also remands for further proceedings claims against Murphy pertaining to Murphy's operation of properties for which the PRO found violations during the year 1979, as well as certain crude oil properties not included within ERA's investigation of Murphy or within the PRO.     On January 24, 1994, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a decision and proposed order (D&amp;PO) that modified the RO and directed recalculation of the amount of restitution.     Ocean Drilling &amp; Exploration Co., et al.    , 66 FERC &para;63,002 (1994). The D&amp;PO is now pending before the Commission in Docket No. RO92&hyph;5&hyph;000. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the D&amp;PO (including ERA's estimate of Murphy's liability for previously unaudited properties and unaudited time periods (yet to be adjudicated by OHA or FERC)) totals approximately $5.2 million.     ERA has preliminarily agreed to the proposed $10,700,000 settlement as resolution of Murphy's liability for DOE regulatory violations for the period covered by the proposed Consent Order. ERA has made this tentative determination after an assessment of the risks of the current matters in litigation. Among other things, ERA has considered the risk pertaining to the following issues that Murphy has raised in its defense: whether Murphy properly applied the definition of ``property'' to certain of its offshore and onshore producing premises in the period September 1973 through August 1976; whether the largest of Murphy's offshore producing premises qualified as multiple DOE ``properties'' under DOE Rulings 1977&hyph;1 and 1977&hyph;2; whether Murphy charged prices in excess of the appropriate ceiling prices for crude oil produced from offshore and onshore properties that it operated; whether Murphy should be liable for 100% of the overcharges associated with sales of crude oil that had been taken ``in kind'' from Murphy-operated properties and sold by working interest owners; and whether Murphy should be liable for 100% of the overcharges associated with certain sales of crude oil from Murphy-operated properties as to which the federal government received a royalty interest. ERA has also considered the time and expense that would be required for the government to litigate every issue fully. Based on these factors, ERA has tentatively concluded that the resolution of its claims against Murphy for $10,700,000 is an appropriate settlement and in the public interest. Except as specifically excluded, all pending and potential civil and administrative disputes, claims and causes of action, whether or not heretofore asserted, between the DOE and Murphy relating to Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations are resolved and extinguished by this Consent Order. Murphy and DOE mutually release each other from the claims arising under the subject matter covered by the proposed Consent Order.     Under the terms of the proposed Consent Order, Murphy is required to pay the sum of $10,700,000 within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the Consent Order and shall maintain records as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the terms of this Consent Order.     If the settlement is not made final by the one hundred fiftieth (150th) day following execution, Murphy may withdraw from the proposed agreement.       Submission of Written Comments:        The proposed Consent Order cannot be made effective until the conclusion of the public review process, of which this Notice is a part.     All comments received by the thirtieth (30th) day following publication of this Notice in the     Federal Register     will be considered before determining whether to adopt the proposed Consent Order as a final Order. Any modifications of the proposed Consent Order which significantly alter its terms or impact will be published for additional comments. If, after considering the comments it has received, ERA determines to issue the proposed Consent Order as a final Order, the proposed Order will be made final and effective by publication of a Notice in the     Federal Register    .

During the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981, Murphy engaged in, among other things, the production, sale and refining of crude oil. On February 9, 1987, Murphy and DOE entered into a Consent Order (hereinafter the 1987 Consent Order) that settled, with certain specific exceptions, all claims and disputes against Murphy by DOE for the period January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981. The 1987 Consent Order specifically excepted, among other things, issues or claims then pending or arising out of first sales of crude oil produced and sold from properties operated by Murphy.         As a result of DOE's investigation of Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December 15, 1986. On June 17, 1992, DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) modified the PRO and issued it as a Remedial Order (RO) to Murphy.     Murphy Oil Corp    ., 22 DOE &para; 83,005 (1992). The RO finds Murphy liable to make restitution of $13,366,664.60, plus interest to the date of restitution, for violations of the regulations applicable to first sales of domestic crude oil (10 CFR &sect;&sect;212.72&hyph;212.74), the regulations exempting from the price rules the sale of crude oil produced from ``stripper well'' properties (10 CFR &sect;&sect;210.32 and 212.54), and the normal business practices rule (10 CFR &sect;210.62(c)) in connection with Murphy's first sales of crude oil during the period September 1973 through December 1979. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the RO would total $67.6 million through June 1994. Murphy appealed that RO to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).     The RO also remands for further proceedings claims against Murphy pertaining to Murphy's operation of properties for which the PRO found violations during the year 1979, as well as certain crude oil properties not included within ERA's investigation of Murphy or within the PRO.     On January 24, 1994, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a decision and proposed order (D&amp;PO) that modified the RO and directed recalculation of the amount of restitution.     Ocean Drilling &amp; Exploration Co., et al.    , 66 FERC &para;63,002 (1994). The D&amp;PO is now pending before the Commission in Docket No. RO92&hyph;5&hyph;000. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the D&amp;PO (including ERA's estimate of Murphy's liability for previously unaudited properties and unaudited time periods (yet to be adjudicated by OHA or FERC)) totals approximately $5.2 million.

headline: Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to Use Imidacloprid; Solicitation of Public Comment 
text:   SUMMARY:     EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Arizona Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide imidacloprid (CAS 105827&hyph;78&hyph;9) to treat up to 55,000 acres of head and leaf lettuce, 8,500 acres of broccoli, 6,100 acres of cauliflower, and 3,500 acres of cabbage to control the sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly (    Bemesia tabaci = argentifolii    ).   The Applicant proposes the first food use of an active ingredient; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.              SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of imidacloprid on head and leaf lettuce, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower to control the sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW). Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request.         The Applicant states that a new strain, or possibly a new species, of whitefly, often referred to as the strain B of sweet potato whitefly, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW), was initially found in Arizona in 1988. Since that time, it has steadily spread to new host plants and grown in population size each summer and fall. The SLW causes damage by feeding, and also through the production of honeydew, which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. When SLWs become numerous as they did in many areas of the state in the past several years, their direct feeding lowers the yield. The SLW has also been implicated as a vector of virus. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SLW is not being achieved with currently registered products and alternative cultural practices. Along with this request, the Applicant has also requested a specific exemption for use of a different chemical, bifenthrin, on the named crops, for control of the same pest. The Applicant justifies requests for two chemicals, by stating that the imidacloprid would be applied once at planting, as a soil treatment; since imidacloprid is a systemic, it would be taken up by the seedling as it germinates, and protect the emerging seedling. The Applicant states that bifenthrin can only be applied as a foliar spray, which is of little value during the early establishment phase of seedling development, as there is limited leaf area at that time. Thus the Applicant proposed that use of bifenthrin be allowed later in the crop season, as a foliar treatment. The Applicant indicates that imidacloprid would not be of use as both a soil treatment and a foliar spray, because its mode of action is such that resistance development is a concern. The Registrant of imidacloprid will not support the use of this chemical further into the growing season for this reason. The Applicant indicates that without adequate control of the SLW in the named crops, significant economic losses will be suffered.    The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 5 oz. (dry) active ingredient (20 fluid oz. of product) per acre with a maximum of one application per crop season on a total of 73,100 acres of the above-listed crops. For each of the crops named, it is possible to produce two crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the acreage could potentially receive two applications of imidacloprid per calendar year. However, the Applicant proposes to limit the maximum amount which could be applied per calendar year to 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fl. oz. product) per acre. Therefore, use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 36,550 lbs. of active ingredient, or 18,275 gal. of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on the named crops. The Applicant received specific exemptions last year (1993) for imidacloprid on broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and head and leaf lettuce, and for bifenthrin on broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce. In 1992, the Applicant was granted specific exemptions for the use of bifenthrin for SLW control in broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce.    This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require publication of a notice of receipt in the     Federal Register     and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing the first food use of an active ingredient. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above.    The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemptions requested by the Arizona Department of Agriculture.

The Applicant states that a new strain, or possibly a new species, of whitefly, often referred to as the strain B of sweet potato whitefly, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW), was initially found in Arizona in 1988. Since that time, it has steadily spread to new host plants and grown in population size each summer and fall. The SLW causes damage by feeding, and also through the production of honeydew, which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. When SLWs become numerous as they did in many areas of the state in the past several years, their direct feeding lowers the yield. The SLW has also been implicated as a vector of virus. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SLW is not being achieved with currently registered products and alternative cultural practices. Along with this request, the Applicant has also requested a specific exemption for use of a different chemical, bifenthrin, on the named crops, for control of the same pest. The Applicant justifies requests for two chemicals, by stating that the imidacloprid would be applied once at planting, as a soil treatment; since imidacloprid is a systemic, it would be taken up by the seedling as it germinates, and protect the emerging seedling. The Applicant states that bifenthrin can only be applied as a foliar spray, which is of little value during the early establishment phase of seedling development, as there is limited leaf area at that time. Thus the Applicant proposed that use of bifenthrin be allowed later in the crop season, as a foliar treatment. The Applicant indicates that imidacloprid would not be of use as both a soil treatment and a foliar spray, because its mode of action is such that resistance development is a concern. The Registrant of imidacloprid will not support the use of this chemical further into the growing season for this reason. The Applicant indicates that without adequate control of the SLW in the named crops, significant economic losses will be suffered.    The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 5 oz. (dry) active ingredient (20 fluid oz. of product) per acre with a maximum of one application per crop season on a total of 73,100 acres of the above-listed crops. For each of the crops named, it is possible to produce two crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the acreage could potentially receive two applications of imidacloprid per calendar year. However, the Applicant proposes to limit the maximum amount which could be applied per calendar year to 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fl. oz. product) per acre. Therefore, use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 36,550 lbs. of active ingredient, or 18,275 gal. of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on the named crops. The Applicant received specific exemptions last year (1993) for imidacloprid on broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and head and leaf lettuce, and for bifenthrin on broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce. In 1992, the Applicant was granted specific exemptions for the use of bifenthrin for SLW control in broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce.    This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require publication of a notice of receipt in the     Federal Register     and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing the first food use of an active ingredient. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above.    The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemptions requested by the Arizona Department of Agriculture.

headline: Statement of Policy for Termiticide Labeling Revision; Availability for Comment
text:   SUMMARY:     EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy for revising soil applied and most other termiticide labeling, except fumigant type termiticides such as sulfuryl fluoride and nitrogen. That policy has been developed in a draft pesticide regulation (PR) notice, ``Termiticide Labeling,'' which is available upon request. Interested parties may request a copy of the Agency's proposed policy as set forth in the address section of this notice.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Because of the highly specialized nature of termiticides, a number of issues evolved over the years with regard to products' labeling: (1) limitations on distribution, sale, or use; (2) precautionary statements; (3) environmental hazards statements; (4) storage and disposal statements; (5) use directions; (6) the longevity of termiticide treatments; and (7) application at less-than-labeled rates. In 1988, representatives from the termiticide manufacturing and user industry, State pesticide regulatory officials, and EPA representatives met voluntarily under the auspices of the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO) and the State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group (SFIREG) to identify specific issues to be addressed. The identified issues were set forth in AAPCO/SFIREG's 1989 Termiticide Labeling Report and were endorsed by the Association of Structural Pest Control Regulatory Officials (ASPCRO).      EPA has reviewed the AAPCO/SFIREG 1989 Termiticide Labeling Report and has developed a draft PR Notice setting forth proposed policy regarding termiticide lableing and longevity of termiticide treatments. This     Federal Register     notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. If, after reviewing any comments, EPA determines that changes to the Policy are warranted, the Agency will revise the Draft PR Notice prior to release.

headline: Cadre; Establishment of a Temporary Tolerance 
text:   SUMMARY:     EPA has established a temporary tolerance for residues of the herbicide cadre in or the raw agricultural commodity peanut hulls or meat at 0.1 part per million (ppm).             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     American Cyanamid Co., Agricultural Research Division, P.O. Box 400, Princeton, NJ 08543&hyph;0400, has requested in pesticide petition (PP) 3G4203 the establishment of a temporary tolerance for residues of the herbicide cadre Ammonium salt of (    #    )-2-[4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-5-oxo-1    H    -imidazol-2-yl]-5-methyl-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid in or on the raw agricultural commodity peanut hulls or meat at 0.1 part per million (ppm). This temporary tolerance will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodity when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit 241-EUP-125, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136).       The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment of the temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been established on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:   1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental use permit.   2. American Cyanamid Co., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration.     This tolerance expires May 31, 1996. Residues not in excess of this amount remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health.   The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.   Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

headline: Receipt of Notification to Conduct Small-Scale Testing of Genetically Altered Microbial Pesticides 
text:   SUMMARY:     This notice announces EPA's receipt of a notification of intent to conduct small-scale testing of four genetically altered strains of     Bacillus thuringiensis     from the Ciba-Geigy Corporation.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to the EPA's Statement of Policy entitled ``Microbial Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act,'' published in the     Federal Register     of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), has been received by Ciba-Geigy Corporation of Greensboro, North Carolina. The purpose of the proposed testing is to determine the biological activity of the     Bacillus thuringiensis strains     CGB203, CGB208, CGB209, and CGB210 against diamondback moth, fall armyworm, beet armyworm, and tomato fruitworm on cole crops and tomatoes over a 2&hyph;year period. These strains have had various     Bacillus thuringiensis     cry genes inserted into them via a     B. thuringiensis - E. coli     shuttle vector containing a     B. thuringiensis     origin of replication and ampicillin and erythromycin resistance markers. One of these strains also had a cry gene introduced via conjugal transfer between two strains of     B. thuringiensis    . The testing will take place in Florida on less than 1 acre per strain per year. Plants in the test sites will be plowed into the soil at the termination of the testing.       Following review of the Ciba-Geigy Corporation application and any comments received in response to this Notice, EPA will decide whether or not an Experimental Use Permit is required.

The purpose of the proposed testing is to determine the biological activity of the     Bacillus thuringiensis strains     CGB203, CGB208, CGB209, and CGB210 against diamondback moth, fall armyworm, beet armyworm, and tomato fruitworm on cole crops and tomatoes over a 2&hyph;year period. These strains have had various     Bacillus thuringiensis     cry genes inserted into them via a     B. thuringiensis - E. coli     shuttle vector containing a     B. thuringiensis     origin of replication and ampicillin and erythromycin resistance markers. One of these strains also had a cry gene introduced via conjugal transfer between two strains of     B. thuringiensis    . The testing will take place in Florida on less than 1 acre per strain per year. Plants in the test sites will be plowed into the soil at the termination of the testing.       Following review of the Ciba-Geigy Corporation application and any comments received in response to this Notice, EPA will decide whether or not an Experimental Use Permit is required.

Whereas    , on or about December 3, 1993, respondent entered into an agreement with Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy Cross''), an Indiana corporation, whereby respondent will acquire from Holy Cross certain Holy Cross assets in Utah (hereinafter the ``Acquisition''); and      Whereas    , the Commission is now investigating the Acquisition to determine if it would violate any of the statutes enforced by the Commission; and        Whereas    , if the Commission accepts the attached Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Consent Order''), which would require the divestiture of certain assets listed in Schedule A of the Consent Order (``Schedule A Assets''), including Holy Cross Hospital (``HCH'') in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Commission must place the Consent Order on the public record for a period of at least sixty (60) days and may subsequently withdraw such acceptance pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules' and      Whereas    , the Commission is concerned that if an understanding is not reached, preserving the     status quo ante     of the Schedule A Assets during the period prior to the final acceptance and issuance of the Consent Order by the Commission (after the 60-day public comment period), divestiture resulting from any proceeding challenging the legality of the Acquisition might not be possible, or might be less than an effective remedy; and      Whereas    , the Commission is concerned that if the Acquisition is consummated, it will be necessary to preserve the Commission's ability to require the divestiture of the Schedule A Assets as described in Paragraph II of the Consent Order and the Commission's right to have HCH continue as a viable independent acute care hospital; and      Whereas    , the purpose of this Agreement and the Consent Order is to:  (i) preserve HCH as a viable independent acute care hospital pending its divestiture, and  (ii) remedy any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition;      Whereas    , respondent's entering into this Agreement shall in no way be construed as an admission by respondent that the Acquisition is illegal; and      Whereas    , respondent understands that no act or transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed immune or exempt from the provisions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act by reason of anything contained in this Agreement.      Now, therefore,     the parties agree, upon understanding that the Commission has not yet determined whether the Acquisition will be challenged, and in consideration of the Commission's agreement that, unless the Commission determines to reject the Consent Order, it will not seek further relief from respondent with respect to the Acquisition, except that the Commission may exercise any and all rights to enforce this Agreement and the Consent Order to which it is annexed and made a part thereof, and in the event the required divestiture is not accomplished, to appoint a trustee to seek divestiture of the Schedule A Assets pursuant to the Consent Order, as follows:  1.

This Agreement shall not be binding until approved by the Commission.          Analysis of Proposed Consent Order Aid Public Comment          The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, a proposed consent order from Healthtrust Inc._The Hospital Company (``Healthtrust''). The agreement would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that Healthtrust's proposed acquisition of three hospitals from Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy Cross'') would have violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, if it had been carried out.    The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or issue and serve the agreement's proposed order.    Both Healthtrust and Holy Cross own and operate acute care hospitals in various states, including acute care hospitals in the Salt Lake City area, encompassing Salt Lake County and southern Davis County; and the Salt Lake City_Ogden Metropolitan Statistical Area, an area encompassing three contiguous counties in northern Utah: Weber County, Davis County, and Salt Lake County (``Three-County Area''). The complaint accompanying the proposed consent order concerns the proposed acquisition's impact upon competition for acute care hospital services in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area. According to the complaint, Healthtrust owns and operates Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful (in southern Davis County) and Pioneer Valley Hospital in West Valley City (in Salt Lake County). Holy Cross owns and operates St. Benedict's Hospital in Ogden (in Weber County), and two acute care hospitals in Salt Lake County, Holy Cross Hospital in Salt Lake City, and Holy-Cross-Jordan Valley Hospital in West Jordan.    The consent order, if finally accepted by the Commission, would settle charges that the acquisition may substantially lessen competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area. The complaint alleges that Healthtrust and Holy Cross are competitors in those markets. The hospital markets in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area, according to the complaint, were already highly concentrated, and entry by new competitors would be difficult. The complaint alleges that the Commission has reason to believe that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effective remedy eliminates such anticompetitive effects.

text: nullnull      The order accepted for public comment contains provisions requiring the divestiture by Healthtrust of the Holy Cross Hospital and related assets, including interests in five clinics, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The purpose of the divestiture is to ensure the continuation of Holy Cross Hospital as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital independent of Healthtrust, and to remedy the lessening of competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets resulting from the acquisition.    The proposed order requires Healthtrust to obtain the approval of the Commission for the divestiture of Holy Cross Hospital. Under the terms of the order, the required divestiture must be completed within six months of the date the order becomes final. If the required divestiture were not completed within the six-month period, Healthtrust would consent to the appointment of a trustee, who would have twelve additional months to effect the divestiture. The hold separate agreement executed as part of the consent order requires Healthtrust, until the completion of the divestiture or as otherwise specified, to hold separate and preserve all of the assets and businesses of Holy Cross Hospital.    The proposed order provides that approval by the Commission of the divestiture shall be conditioned upon the agreement by the acquirer that, for ten years from the date of the divestiture, it will not sell, without the prior approval of the Commission, Holy Cross Hospital to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) any other acute care hospital in the Three-County Area.    The order would prohibit Healthtrust from acquiring any acute care hospital in the Three-County Area without the prior approval of the Federal Trade Commission. It would also prohibit Healthtrust from transferring, without prior Commission approval, any acute care hospital it operates in the Three-County Area to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) an acute care hospital in the area. These provisions, in combination, would give the Commission authority to prohibit any substantial combination of the acute care hospital operations of Healthtrust with those of any other acute care hospital in the Three-County Area, unless Healthtrust convinced the Commission that a particular transaction would not endanger competition in the Salt Lake City area or the Three-County Area. The provisions would not apply to acquisitions or sales where the value of the transferred assets is $1 million or less, and the provisions would expire ten years after the order becomes final.    For ten years, the order would prohibit Healthtrust from transferring all or any substantial part of any hospital in the Three-County Area to another party without first filing with the Commission an agreement by the transferee to be bound by the order.    The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order, to assist the Commission in its determination whether to make the order final. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way.    The agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Healthtrust that its proposed acquisition would have violated the law, as alleged in the Commission's complaint.       <SIGNER>  Donald S.

text: nullnull      Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Dennis A. Yao        In HealthTrust/Holy Cross, File No. 941 0020        I voted against acceptance of the proposed consent agreement in this matter, as well as against a previous motion to seek a preliminary injunction to enjoin HealthTrust from acquiring three Holy Cross hospitals in the Salt Lake City, Utah, area. The three hospitals to be acquired were: Jordan Valley, a 50-bed hospital located in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area; St. Benedict's, a 239-bed tertiary level hospital  1   located approximately 34 miles north of Salt Lake City in Ogden; and a 200-bed tertiary facility located in downtown Salt Lake City. In analyzing the original proposed transaction, I concluded that the merger of these two hospital systems would generate significant net efficiencies that would outweigh any potential anticompetitive effects of the merger in the Salt Lake City Metropolitan area and throughout the Wasatch Front. Specifically, the Holy Cross hospitals offered HealthTrust the opportunity to expand its geographic coverage by including hospitals located throughout the Wasatch Front, and broaden the services it provided by including a downtown Salt Lake City tertiary care facility.            1      Medical services are generally divided into primary, secondary, tertiary and now quaternary levels. Primary services are provided by generalists, including family practitioners, pediatricians, obstetricians, and internists. Secondary services are provided by specialists, such as cardiologists, oncologists, and orthopedic specialists. Tertiary services are those provided by sub-specialists, such as invasive cardiology or neurosurgery. Quaternary level services are those offered by only a few highly specialized facilities, like high level burn units or organ transplants. The demarcation between the various levels of service is not precise, but these levels are all included as part of the ``acute care inpatient hospital services'' market alleged in the complaint here.          The proposed consent allows HealthTrust to acquire two of the Holy Cross hospitals, Jordan Valley and St. Benedict's, while requiring divestiture of the downtown Holy Cross hospital. Allowing HealthTrust to acquire the two Holy Cross hospitals will give HealthTrust better geographic coverage across the Wasatch Front. However, requiring the divestiture of the downtown Holy Cross facility means that the newly formed hospital network will not include a tertiary care facility in the Salt Lake City Metropolitan area.    It was argued in this case (as it has been argued in several recent hospital mergers) that the merging hospital systems can achieve network and operational efficiencies through acquisition that are not possible through alternative arrangements such as contracting or joint venturing. Parties have sought to show that contracting and joint venturing is inefficient as an alternative to outright merger, among other reasons, because of the need to deter ``gaming'' on patient referrals as each hospital attempts to shift costly patients to other hospitals. This argument seems plausible in this industry because of contracting problems involved in establishing ``capitation'' regimes.    In this particular case, it was argued that purchasing a downtown Salt Lake City tertiary care facility was essential to achieve network efficiencies and that contracting or joint venturing was an inferior alternative. I find this argument persuasive.  2   Therefore, because I believe that the bulk of the network and operational efficiencies that are possible from this merger will be lost if the downtown facility is divested, and because I believe that the potential anticompetitive effects that may have resulted from allowing HealthTrust to acquire the downtown facility are outweighed by those efficiencies, I have dissented from the issuance of this consent.             2      The relative effectiveness of different organizational forms such as mergers, joint ventures or contracting relationships deserves further study in light of the current restructuring of the health care industry. While I agree that network efficiency claims may be more credible if they are endorsed by health plans (see Remarks of Mary Lou Steptoe before the Practicing Law Institute, June 17&hyph;20, 1994) we are often presented with situations of ``dueling'' affidavits, in which case other evidence must be present to support such claims.

text: nullnull      Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment        The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from respondents L&amp;S Research Corporation and Scott Chinery.    The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed order.        Body Building Products        The Commission's complaint charges that the respondents deceptively advertised Cybergenics Total Body Building System and Cybergenics for Hard Gainers, two body building products. According to the complaint, the respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that either or both body building products: (1) cause users to lose more body fat and gain more muscle than non-users; (2) cause users to lose body fat and gain muscle more rapidly than non-users; (3) cause users to gain more muscle than users of other body building products; (4) have been demonstrated by scientific research to cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (5) work for all people; and (6) are new and unique.        Weight Loss Products        The Commission's complaint also charges that the respondents deceptively advertised there weight loss products, Cybergenics CyberTrim, Cybergenics Mega-Fat Burner, and Cybergenics QuickTrim. According to the complaint, the respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that one or more of the wright loss products: (1) cause users to lose body fat and weight more rapidly than non-users; (2) cause users to lose weight and lose or burn more body fat than non-users; (3) cause users to lose more body fat and weight than users of all other weight loss products; (4) cause users to lose weight more rapidly than the users of all other weight loss products; (5) are superior to other appetite suppressants; (6) suppress hunger and the biochemical message stimulated by the catabolism of fat; (7) cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (8) contain an ingredient, chromium picolinate, that has been clinically proven to reduce fat and lower cholesterol; (9) are new and unique; (10) cause users to maintain weight loss longer than non-users; (11) cause maturing women to lose more weight than non-users of the product; (12) are easy to use; and (13) have been demonstrated by scientific evidence to cause users to lose more fat and weight, and to gain more muscle, than non-users.        Use of Testimonials        The Commission's complaint also charges that statements and depictions, including ``before'' and ``after'' pictures, in the respondents' advertisements for their body building and weight loss products, represent that the testimonials from consumers who use the advertised product reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members of the public who use the products. According to the complaint, the respondents did not have a reasonable basis for this representation.    In addition, the complaint alleges that the use of a picture of a man in an advertisement for Cybergenics Total Body Building System ``before'' and ``after'' he used the product for six months is false and misleading. The man pictured in the advertisement, according to the complaint, was a champion body builder prior to the time when the ``before'' picture was taken and, therefore, is not typical of users of the product, and his results as shown in the ``after'' picture are not typical of the experience of ordinary members of the public who use the product.

text: nullnull      Proposed Order        Part I of the proposed order prohibits representations that the product component of either of the body building products named in the complaint, or any substantially similar product:    (1) causes users to achieve greater or more rapid loss of fat or gain of muscle than non-users of the product; or     (2) works for all users.    Part II of the proposed order prohibits representations that the product component of any of the three weight loss products named in the complaint, or any substantially similar product:    (1) causes users to maintain weight loss longer than non-users; or    (2) causes maturing women to lose more weight than non-users.    Part III prohibits respondents from representing that scientific evidence establishes that the product component of any of the body building and weight loss products named in the complaint causes users to lose more fat or weight, or gains more muscle, than non-users.    Part IV requires the respondents to cease from making a number of representations about any product or program unless they have substantiation consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence. The claims that are prohibited unless substantiated are as follows:    (1) that any product or program causes or assists users to lose fat or weight or to maintain weight loss, or suppresses hunger or appetite;    (2) that any product or program causes or assists in muscle gain or development;    (3) that any product or program works for all users;    (4) that chromium picolinate in any product or used in conjunction with any program builds muscle, reduces fat, or lowers cholesterol; and     (5) that any product or program intended for body building, weight loss, or fat loss is more effective than other products or programs intended for similar purposes.    Part V of the proposed order requires respondents to have substantiation, which when appropriate must consist of competent and reliable scientific evidence, for believing that endorsements, including ``before'' and ``after'' pictures, represent the typical or ordinary experience of users of any product or program. However, the respondents may use any endorsement if they disclose clearly and prominently in close proximity to the endorsement what the generally expected performance would be in the depicted circumstances, or that consumers should not expect to achieve results similar to those of the endorser.    Part VI prohibits the respondents from misrepresenting that any product or program is new or unique, or that any product or program intended for weight loss is easy to use if achieving the advertised results requires a special diet or exercise.    Part VII requires the respondents to cease misrepresenting the contents, validity, or results of any study in connection with the marketing or any product or program.    Part VIII requires the respondents to pay $1,450,000 to the United States Treasury and provides that none of this amount is deemed to be a fine, penalty, or punitive assessment.    The remaining provisions are standard record keeping and reporting provisions designed to ensure that the respondents remain in compliance with the other provisions of the order.

Azcuenaga in L&amp;S Research Corporation, File No. 912&hyph;3004        The Commission has strong evidence supporting the central allegations in this complaint, and I have voted to accept the consent agreement for public comment. In my view, however, the complaint should not allege that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim were false. I am inclined to believe that the claims are false but I would prefer to have some corroborating evidence of falsity before finding reason to believe that Section 5 of the FTC Act has been violated. Because the available information shows only that there is no evidence that these claims are true, it seems to me more appropriate to allege that they are unsubstantiated.    In addition, the QuickTrim weight loss allegations seem inconsistent in light of the evidence. The complaint alleges that the weight loss claim for maturing women users of QuickTrim is false but alleges that the same claim for all users of QuickTrim is unsubstantiated. Yet we have no evidence indicating that the weight loss claims are any more likely to be false for maturing women than for users generally.    I therefore do not support the complaint to the extent that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim are alleged to be false, not unsubstantiated.         </SIGNJOB>    [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18259 Filed 7&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am]      <BILLING>  BILLING CODE 6750&hyph;01&hyph;M  </BILLING>

text:   SUMMARY:     In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition, this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, a Ohio-based drugstore chain to divest, within one year of the order, to a Commission approved acquirer, all assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in either the respondent's store or in the acquired Hook-SupeRx (HSI) retail store in each of three geographic areas, and to complete the divestiture within one year. If not complete in that period of time, the order would require the respondent to consent to the appointment of a trustee to divest the assets. In addition, the proposed consent agreement would require the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years, before acquiring any similar business interest in any of the three specified towns.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Pursuant to Section 6(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 721, 15 U.S.C. 46 and Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules of Practice (16 CFR 2.34), notice is hereby given that the following consent agreement containing a consent order to divest, having been filed with and accepted, subject to final approval, by the Commission, has been placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days.
